"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","Direct and indirect impacts in this large area would destroy, degrade and fragment the previously undeveloped desert habitat and effectively sever connections between it and other unique landscapes and habitats in the region (i.e., sagebrush steppe, lava flows of Craters of the Moon, lava tube caves, irrigated agricultural fields, ephemeral ponds and water impoundments, canal systems, Snake River). Because the proposed project is so large, it may be difficult for some species to find suitable replacement lands to support necessary foraging territories and migration pathways.

"WATER03","3 - Groundwater","WATER","Water Resources ","Water is life. This is a fact that everyone in our area is acutely aware of. Even if you are not a farmer or a rancher, you know that water is the lifeblood of our area. There have been studies that show that the vibrations that are caused by industrial wind turbines can damage wells and maybe even the aquifer. 

""The development of a wind farm has the potential to impact on groundwater quality, groundwater quantity and/or the established groundwater flow regime. The key impacts to groundwater that can result from the construction, operational and decommissioning stages of wind farms are summarised in Table 1 below. 

Table 1: Potential impacts on groundwater from wind farms 

[see table in full comment]

(Northern Ireland Environment Agency, 2017) 

In addition to this information there have also been stories of communities whose well water has been contaminated or their wells have collapsed due to the vibrations that the wind turbines send into the ground. 

Our area is already hurting for water from year to year. On some farms the only source of water is from wells. Our aquifer is finally starting to recover but we have learned how fragile and precious water is over the years. No one in our area has the desire to put the source of all life in Lincoln County in jeopardy. "

"PROJ02","2 - Materials/Supply Chain","PROJ","Project Description","Should the project proceed, there will be a large need for sand, gravel and crushed rock for construction. The BLM should estimate if areas that will be disturbed by road construction and rock blasting can provide sufficient amounts of this construction material or if additional gravel pits or rock quarries will have to be developed within the project boundaries. If off site material is likely to be needed, the BLM should also describe which off site locations may be utilized and the resulting effects."

"
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The erection of turbines for this project is unquestionably a visual eyesore and in this project, there are intentions to build on the Minidoka National Historic Site.  These turbines and related equipment on and immediately surrounding this site would not only be a visual assault on every person that visits this site, but an offense to the memory and legacy of those Japanese Americans that were incarcerated in that camp.  There is VERY little that remains of the original camp and the turbines will only detract from the original structures and the quality of the visitors' experience.  

The Bureau of Land Management's mission ""is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations"".  Allowing turbines to be built on this site would certainly not provide 'enjoyment' to any visitors to this site or to anyone with relatives that were incarcerated there."
"OPP01","1 - General","OPP","General Opposition","I am AGAINST this project, it is futile:
    Windmills require petroleum every single step of their life cycle. If they can’t replicate themselves using wind turbine generated electricity, they are not sustainable
    Not enough rare earth metals and enormous amounts of cement, steel, and other materials required
    Wind blows seasonally, so for much of there year there wouldn’t be enough wind
    When too much wind is blowing for the grid to handle, it has to be curtailed and/or drives electricity prices to zero, driving natural gas, coal, and nuclear power plants out of business
    The best wind areas will never be developed
    The Grid Can’t Handle Wind Power without natural gas, which is finite
    The role of the grid is to keep the supply of power steady and predictable. Wind does the opposite, at some point of penetration it may become impossible to keep the grid from crashing.
    Windmills wouldn’t be built without huge subsidies and tax breaks
    Tremendous environmental damage from mining material for windmills
     The best wind is too high or remote to capture
      Less wind can be captured than thought (see Max Planck Society)
    Wind is only strong enough to justify windmills in a few regions
    The electric grid needs to be much larger than it is now
    Wind blows the strongest when customer demand is the weakest
    No utility scale energy storage in sight
    Wind Power surges harm industrial customers
    Energy returned on Energy Invested is negative
    Windmills take up too much space
    Wind Turbines break down too often
    Large-scale wind energy slows down winds and reduces turbine efficiencies
    Offshore Wind Farms likely to be destroyed by Hurricanes
    The costs of lightning damage are too high
    Wind doesn’t reduce CO2
    Turbines increase the cost of farming
    Offshore Windmills battered by waves, wind, ice, corrosion, a hazard to ships and ecosystems
    Wind turbines are far more expensive than they appear to be
    Wind turbines are already going out of business and fewer built in Europe
    TRANSPORTATION LIMITATIONS: Windmills are so huge they’ve reached the limits of land transportation by truck or rail
    Windmills may only last 12 to 15 years, or at best 20 years
    Not In My Back Yard – NIMBYism
    Offshore wind turbines could affect fisheries
    The quality of wind resources is location specific, with the best locations often found far from the load center
    Dead bugs and salt reduce wind power generation by 20 to 30%
    Small windmills too expensive, too noisy, unreliable, and height restricted
    Trucks are the basis of civilization, when diesel runs out, collapse will follow. Trucks can’t be electrified
    Germany has been spending more for much longer than other nations, and Energiewiende is a huge failure
    Wind turbines more expensive to decommission than construct so often not recycled
    Transmission lines need to be much longer than for fossil plants, and likely to spark firestorms causing billions in damage
    Decommissioning wind turbines costs as much as $500,000 per wind turbine
    Wind turbines threaten biodiversity in hundreds of protected, key biodiversity, and wilderness areas
    Wind turbines and solar PV depend on the energy storage of coal and natural gas plants to provide power when the wind dies
    Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs are too high
    Increasingly high insurance costs from hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, defective equipment, untrained personnel and more
    Turbines can’t be improved much, they are nearing the maximum possible harvesting of wind
    Blades need to be de-iced with helicopters in the winter
    Turbines are so heavy they damage roads during delivery"

"AIR03","3 - Climate Change/GHG","AIR","Air Quality","Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Lava Ridge Wind project.  I would recommend that in evaluating this project, you should keep in mind the climate benefits of the additional renewable energy that this project will  produce.  Although reasonable efforts should be made in the design of the project to mitigate the impacts on birds and other wildlife, they should not be a reason to deny permission to build the project.  The slight impacts to wildlife in the immediate vicinity of the project are mitigated by the larger positive impacts of increasing the production of renewable energy.  Wildlife in the area are already impacted by worsening extremes in temperature, changes in precipitation and climate driven wildfires both in the
 local area and from smoke travelling hundreds of miles.  Without projects like this one, these impacts will only worsen. "
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","When evaluating the impact of the project on the Minidoka National Historic site, keep in mind that the primary purpose of the site is preserving the history of the internment of Japanese citizens and incarceration of Japanese Americans at the site during World War II.  Visitors primarily focus on the historic buildings and displays at the site and would not be adversely impacted by wind turbines located several miles away.  The larger threat to the site would be a climate change driven wild fire destroying the historic structures rather than a wind turbine visible in the distance."

Although in general I support alternative sources of energy, the effects this project will have on this historic site will be devastating.   A few years ago I was able to visit Minidoka.  As I walked around the site the significance of this site was overwhelming.   The public needs to feel the historical significance of this camp.  Changing the natural environment and landscapes will take away from the emotional impact of what it was really like for people to be forced to live there.  Please, save this historic site and work toward preserving the Minidoka property and minimizing the view of wind turbines from inside Minidoka."
"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","As I understand, most, if not all, of the project falls under the General sage grouse Habitat Management Area framework- meaning the BLM would be required to provide a 0.25 buffer for roads, 0.6 mile buffer for infrastructure related to energy development, and a 0.12 mile buffer for fences around leks.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks"," I have a great concern about the building of wind farms around Minadoka; a historic memorial to the American Internment camp for Japanese Americans. I was able to visit Mindoka in 2019 and saw what my great grandparents, Kiyoko and Katsumi Nakayama and great aunt, Joni Kimoto, who were brought on trains with blacked out windows so they couldn't see where they were going, first saw this unknown place. They were met with barbed wire, and the vast Idaho desert, flat and barren with dust storms and frigid nights. This landscape is an integral part of how this history is told, for the visitors to be able to step into the conditions that were forcibly put upon Japanese Americans. My Grandfather, Keith Nakayama, was born with barbed wire and towers with guns surrounding him. Being in that vast desert was integral to my experience at Mindoka, exposing me to the intimate feeling of isolation that my family and many others had experienced while imprisoned there.

I believe that renewal energy is an valuable cause but not when it threatens to alter an important and painful history, on historic land. To destroy the original conditions is a disrespect to the direly important and intergal history of this country. "

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Every summer, groups of our members, and families with ties to Minidoka make a pilgrimage to the National Historic Site. It is an important opportunity for us to remember, reflect, and reconnect as a community. In addition to these pilgrimages, Minidoka provides educational opportunities for the public to learn about an important part of Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) history. It is part of a network of Japanese American camps and other sites of conscience, managed by the National Park Service (NPS) for the benefit of current and future generations.  

By law, the National Park Service is required to manage the park’s fundamental resources and values unimpaired for future generations. As stated in the Park’s Foundation Document, these values include:  
●	Environmental Setting: “Minidoka’s remote location in the high desert of Idaho provides an immersive setting that is fundamental to the visitor experience. Views of open fields and distant mountains create a sense of isolation on a vast landscape where Minidoka once stood…Extreme changes in temperature, the arid environment, and high winds that the people at Minidoka experienced are part of the environmental setting that are felt today. Experiencing this environmental setting allows visitors to better understand and connect to the daily lives at Minidoka.”
●	Commemoration and Healing: Minidoka provides a place “… for engagement, reflection, and healing. These sites provoke connections to individuals affected by the World War II exclusion, forced removal, and unjust incarceration, and serves to commemorate those who survived this difficult chapter of American history.”
●	Public Understanding, Education, and Involvement: “Educating and engaging the public in understanding the history of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, the fragile nature of civil rights, and the need to protect civil and constitutional rights in the United States is essential...At Minidoka, special events such as the pilgrimage and the civil liberties symposium connect the public to the history that occurred here and its significance today.”"

The traumatic experience of Minidoka affected thousands of first and second generation Japanese Americans, and the current site is a stark reminder of lives drastically altered and changed forever. The stories of the unfair imprisonment of Japanese Americans must be told to educate those who remain unaware of the unjust loss of civil liberties that befell innocent US citizens.

A forest of wind turbines on the land where thousands suffered incarceration will alter the physical landscape and negatively impact the historic grounds of the National Monument. It will be a visual blight and negatively affect former incarcerees and others who come to learn and commemorate the time of inequality and race prejudice.

I see in your report that you have considered multiple possible impacts of the wind turbines but don’t mention the Japanese Internment Site once meaning you haven’t even considered it.  I hope that is an oversight and not intentional.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The problem is that this project appears to overlap the traditional area of the Minidoka War Relocation Center on Hunt Road in Jerome. Also, it would be within eyesight of the Minidoka National Historic Center that currently sits in a smaller footprint from the original internment camp.  

The Minidoka National Historic Center is an area of pride among Japanese living in Idaho because it's a cultural symbol that shows how far Idaho, and the US, has come in discrimination again Asian Americans. It shows that the US, and Idaho, now welcomes Japanese nationals who want to live, work, and invest in Idaho. While Minidoka represents a historical blot on America's record of dealing with Japanese and Japanese Americans, the Minidoka National Historic Center has been seen as an active way the US is trying to correct that past and heal. It is a deeply important cultural symbol in Idaho, in the US and in Japan. 

Opening the historical grounds of Minidoka for this project would harm that trust. The project map shows that the project could be literally built on the graves of Japanese Americans buried in this area, many of which area still unmarked. No amount of reclamation could correct this damage once the project is over. This project would forever destroy an important part of Idaho's cultural history, if it's built to current plan.

It is my understanding that many other Idaho residents of the magic valley are opposed to this project, these are based on either unfounded fears of exaggerated environmental concerns or purely selfish reasons. Currently, 76% of the electricity generated in Idaho at utility-scale power plants was produced from renewable energy sources. That is something every Idaho resident should be proud of, but in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which are already devastating our lands through drought,  we must push towards 100%, as should every state in the union. This wind project will undoubtedly have a localized negative impact on the environment, this is a necessary cost to reduce the use of fossil fuels and avoid worse environmental impacts. The most notable environmental fear amongst opponents of wind power is the impact on birds. Loss of habitat due to drought which is made worse by climate change will have a much strong impact on bird populations than wind farms. We must also acknowledge that all forms of power generation have some environmental impact. The communities living in proximity to coal and natural gas generators are suffering from the pollution caused by those power sources. For magic valley residents to say they must shoulder that burden so that we don't have to look at turbines on our horizon is absolutely ridiculous."

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The Minidoka National Historic Site is a site that is of utmost importance to preserve. In WWII the US government identified American Citizens with Japanese heritage and put them in camps to protect the greater population from the threat they posed during the war. The reasoning behind this policy was that despite their American citizenship, these Americans would support the Japanese war effort. They did not and some even served in the armed forces during WWII. When the war ended and the camps were discontinued many Japanese-Americans, regardless of where they came from, stayed in the agricultural areas that they were sent to. They had been taken from their homes, put in camps, and years later had to restart their lives. The historic site memorializes the history of the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in America. Here in Idaho, JACL preserves and passes down this history. It is only by remembering that we can seek to not repeat history. 

I am a Japanese-American and the preservation of this site is of utmost importance to me. While this wind farm may not encroach upon Minidoka, the close proximity of the wind turbines is hurtful to the people whose ancestors were incarcerated in this place. While I understand the importance of investing in new forms of energy and a connected electric system, if at all possible, I urge the BLM to reconsider it's windfarm location."
"PROJ02","2 - Materials/Supply Chain","PROJ","Project Description","I am AGAINST this project.  It is futile:

James Hansen, the former NASA climate scientist, wrote in 2011: “Suggesting that renewables will let us phase out rapidly fossil fuels is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter bunny.”
The other thing about renewables is that they cannot produce the intensity of heat required to not only build turbines but just about anything else that makes the modern world modern.
The material requirements of a modern wind turbine have been reviewed by the US Geological Survey (Wind Energy in the United States and Materials Required for the Land-Based Turbine Industry From 2010 Through 2030). On average, 1 megawatt of wind capacity requires 103 tonnes of stainless steel, 402 tonnes of concrete, 6.8 tonnes of fibreglass, three tonnes of copper and 20 tonnes of cast iron. The blades are made of fibreglass, the tower of steel and the base of concrete.
Robert Wilson at Carbon Counter takes us through the ­science. Fibreglass is produced from petrochemicals, which means that a wind turbine cannot be made without the extraction of oil and natural gas. Steel is made from iron ore. To mine ore requires high energy density fuels, such as diesel. Transporting ore to steel mills requires diesel.
Converting iron ore into steel requires a blast furnace, which requires large amounts of coal or natural gas. The blast furnace is used for most steel production.
Coal is essential, not simply a result of the energy requirements of steel production but of the chemical requirements of iron ore smelting.
Cement is made in a kiln, using kiln fuel such as coal, natural gas or used tyres. About 50 per cent of emissions from cement production comes from chemical reactions in its production.
Then there is the problem of priming windmills. Large wind turbines require a large amount of energy to operate. Wind plants must use electricity from the grid, which is powered by coal, gas or nuclear power.
A host of the wind turbine functions use electricity that the turbine cannot be relied on to generate – functions such as blade-pitch control, lights, controllers, communication, sensors, metering, data collection, oil heater, pump, cooler, filtering system in gearboxes, and much more.

Wind turbines cannot be built and cannot operate on a large scale without fossil fuels."
"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","All forms of energy, including wind power, have impacts on birds. Our role as a regional stakeholder is to make sure that key species and high conservation areas for birds are protected as much as possible and in accordance with federal law. 

The risk of a bird collision with wind turbines/transmission lines is influenced based on turbine/transmission line placement, turbine design, and how birds move across the landscape. This is deemed a critical element in reducing bird/wind power collision risk. Over 200 species of bird have been documented as killed by collision with wind turbines. Passerines are most reported, followed by raptors that hunt by day such as hawks, eagles and falcons.  

Habitat impacts are also a major concern with wind energy facilities as they are often large developments that, if improperly placed, may cause a loss or fragmentation of habitat that species frequently use or depend on for survival. Knowing where certain birds are and when, and siting facilities to avoid high movement or occurrence areas can make a big difference in avoiding and reducing bird impacts. Specifically, the prospect of a Greater Sage-Grouse Endangered Species Act listing has brought attention to the condition of the sage-steppe system. This iconic bird’s habitat has been fragmented by development of sagebrush environments and there has been a considerable loss of suitable sagebrush habitat to support the bird’s life history, including its needs for food, cover and nesting space. Federal land managers must take bold steps to successfully manage the sage-steppe ecosystem for it to remain a vibrant and functional landscape.

Prairie Falcon Audubon members participate in numerous citizen science projects in and around the proposed Lava Ridge Project footprint which includes Greater Sage- Grouse lek surveys and winter raptor surveys.  Wilson Reservoir is considered a birding “hotspot” throughout the state of Idaho during the winter months.  This small body of water provides a resting spot for Common and Pacific Loons, Trumpeter Swans, Surf Scoters, and a plethora of waterfowl and shorebirds.  As the waters recede during the winter, large numbers of Bald Eagles are observed feeding on carp.  Bird species diversity is the jewel in this area.

Please consider the following requests and recommendations:
•	Request wind energy project location, design, operation, and lighting should be carefully evaluated to prevent bird mortality.
•	Request that thorough, seasonal surveys be performed for sensitive species and a full disclosure of survey methods and results be provided to the public and other agencies to allow for analysis for proper siting and avoidance of these sensitive areas.
•	Recommend that a cumulative effects analysis must encompass the full range of habitat for potentially affected species (e.g., breeding grounds, migration route, wintering areas, and total range of affected populations). 
•	Demonstrate that federal agencies will enforce provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act once the project is in place.

"PROJ01","1 - General","PROJ","Project Description","To begin, I want to express my general concerns regarding the size and scope of the Lava Ridge Wind Project. As described in initial scoping documents and meetings, the Project as proposed would be one of the largest in the Nation and certainly the largest in the State of Idaho, consuming a very significant portion of all public lands within Jerome County and a smaller percentage of those in Lincoln and Minidoka Counties. The direct footprint of ~119 square miles, where 400 turbines, hundreds of miles of new access roads and powerlines, multiple new substations, staging and laydown areas, and met towers are proposed is concentrated within a much larger area of approximately 351 square miles, where indirect impacts such as expanded gravel pits, wild land fire fuel breaks, vehicle traffic, new fences, use of scarce water resources, dust abatement, weed invasion, increased use of pesticides and rodenticides, expanded housing developments, light and sound pollution, shadow flicker, visual intrusions, and a myriad of other disturbances will combine with project infrastructure."
"VIS01","1 - General","VIS","Visual Resources","For a project of this magnitude, view-shed impacts will also be unavoidable and are likely to be present at a regional scale given the generally low topographic relief that predominates and the unprecedented height of the proposed turbines. In fact, I believe it is likely that Lava Ridge powerlines and turbines, with their moving blades and the lights that will be required for operation, would be highly visible at distances of 20 - 30 miles or more from the proposed project area. At distances of 10- 20 miles or less from the proposed project area, Lava Ridge components would be major sources of visual contrast. "
"OPP01","1 - General","OPP","General Opposition","Within the very large direct and indirect footprint of the proposed project, I am very concerned about potential direct and indirect/viewshed impacts to the following specific categories of resources:

•	natural features of the landscape such as lava tube caves, rocky ridges, and low buttes, ephemeral ponds, and water resources flowing through historic canal systems, which are important to wildlife and people, alike;
•	impacts cultural resources such as the Minidoka National Historic site, Wilson Butte Cave and other lava tubes, archaeological sites reflecting a rich local human history of more than 15,000 years, resources and landscape features important to contemporary Native American people, and historic sites and National Register properties located in the surrounding area (e.g., Rock Creek Station and Stricker Homesite on the Oregon Trail, Lava Rock Structures and other historic properties in the ranch and farmlands in Jerome and Lincoln Counties;

For example, generally speaking, the Notice provides no information as to planning and timing during the construction phase as to each of the “Project Component[s]” or Wind Structures, see Notice at PDF page 7, except to suggest that the construction phase will be 2-years which we contend is unrealistic. In addition, the Notice provides no information as to planning and timing during the operation & maintenance phase.

"SOC01","1 - General","SOC","Socioeconomics","Relative to a socio-economic impact, as of April, 2021, the value of the Active Use AUMs (aka 17,770 AUMs) in the Star Lake Allotment would likely be $17.7 million or more, though an appraisal may warrant even a higher figure. The gross annual income generated from the Permittees to support the local, regional, and national economic would likely range between $12 million and $20 million, though that does not include the multiplier-effect of such sum within the local and regional economy. The gross annual property taxes paid by the Permittees based upon their base properties and upon other private land is currently at least $137,000 per year. While we are informed that the intended Wind Project will support 20 employees during the operation / maintenance phase, the Permittees annually employ at least 57 full-time and part- time employees. Thus, it is apparent that the Permittees themselves provide a significant socio- economic input, particularly in the job category. Any temporary or permanent negation or mitigation of the Permittees’ authorized grazing use caused by the intended project will have correspondently, adverse impacts to at least the local economy."
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","(c)	Impacts to livestock operations during construction phase of intended Wind Project.

It has been found that construction activities would generally result in temporary impacts to existing livestock operations. 2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume I, at page 5-86. If, for example, the area is used for grazing, livestock might need to be removed from the areas where blasting or heavy equipment operating are taking place. 2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume I, at page 5-86. To this end, Permittees have the following site-specific comments as to the intended project on the Star Lake Allotment during the construction phase of the intended Wind Project.

Permittee is informed that the applicant estimates that construction would take 2 years. However, constructing a project of this magnitude in the terrain and climate associated with the Star Lake Allotment in 2 years seems unrealistic, though, if accomplished, it would be at great cost to the resource. It is more likely that the construction phase will take several years.
 
What will happen to the permitted livestock during the construction phase (and after the construction phase) to construct the intended 926 acres of project components or Wind Structures riddled throughout the Star Lake Allotment? See Table above, as well as Notice at PDF page 6. It is assumed that construction would be coordinated with the grazing rotational use by the permitted livestock so that construction and grazing use does not occur simultaneously in the same pasture(s). However, that seems unrealistic, given the likely need for the applicant to use the access roads3 throughout any grazing season to access the construction sites of the various other Wind Structures.

•	Is the applicant going to pay for the lost AUMs (either permanently or temporarily)?
•	Is the applicant going to pay for alternative forage for the lost AUMs (either via hay or via leased private pasture)?

Finding leased private pasture in the area for 3,500 head of cattle would be practically impossible. If leased private pasture can be located, it would be at great expense and unfamiliar to the Permittees’ animals resulting in herd health issues. This is just reflecting what permitted livestock the Star Lake allotment supports. If you add the numbers from the other affected allotments including the North Milner, the Sid Butte, and the Dietrich Butte Allotments, 3,500 head of livestock likely increases to 5,000 to 6,000 head of cattle displaced in the area.

Independent to the impacts to the Permitted Use AUMs, what will happen to the public land range improvements during the construction phase (and after the construction phase)? Such construction will likely damage fences, pipelines, troughs, and Wells.

•	Is the applicant going to pay for any damage and/or repair to the existing public land range improvements (either permanently or temporarily)?
•	Is the applicant going to pay for alternative or supplemental fences and water developments to mitigate any impacts (either permanently or temporarily)?

Permittees have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on water development in the Star Lake Allotment. This includes drilling 5 Wells to depths of 600 to 800 feet; installing pumps in the Wells; installing 60 to 80 miles of pipeline; installing underground wire to power pumps; installing water storage tanks; and installing troughs. In fact, all of the permittees in the Star Lake Allotment have spent nearly $100,000 on a pipeline and water storage system in just the last 2 years. This storage tank was designed to provide 150,000-gallon ready source of water for livestock, as well as fire suppression efforts.

"TRAN03","3 - Road Maintenance","TRAN","Transportation","3 Beyond the intended access roads within the Star Lake Allotment, BLM would need to assess the adverse impact upon other local, county, State roads and infrastructure.

"OOS01","1 - General","OOS","Out of Scope","In fact, to accommodate the public land resources in the 1960s, the permittees within the Star Lake Allotment took a voluntary reduction in grazing use and committed to an AUM suspension agreement with the understanding that the AUMs would be reactivated once the permittees developed the allotment with rotational management, seedings, water, and fencing.
Permittees contend that they have satisfied such commitments over 25 years ago to the level that the Suspended Use AUMs should be or should have already been reinstated. See discussion above as to 2009 applications to activate Suspended Use AUMs. Permittees have made major investments in the resource and also spent nearly $100,000 in production monitoring to demonstrate the availability of additional forage on a sustained-yield basis. For nearly 12-years BLM has deferred acting on such 2009 applications, and now with this intended wind project, it seems all hope for any return on our investment and fair treatment may be lost. Will the applicant compensate us for such loss investment or will BLM commit to process our 2009 applications?"

"FIRE01","1 - General","FIRE","Fire and Fuels Management","The BLM should examine how project construction and operations will affect both fire activity and suppression efforts. Because of the terrain, the majority of electrical lines are anticipated to be built above ground. The new overhead lines and increased vehicle use in the project area may increase the fire risks to the project area. While the new road network can act as a fuel break, we are concerned that aerial fire suppression activities will likely be more limited due to the wind turbines and supporting infrastructure. We appreciate the outline of fire prevention and fire fighting measures listed in the Health and Safety Plan (Appendix  F) as a starting point for the NEPA analysis. We recommend having fire fighting equipment in multiple vehicles within each active construction area, having caches of fire fighting equipment located in key locations, and working with the local community to develop a Rangeland Fire Protection Associations for the project area as well as the surrounding area. Any replacement livestock watering ponds should be located so they are accessible for water tankers and helicopters. 

We do not recommend creating any additional fuel breaks off of roads in areas of native vegetation as there will already be significant habitat fragmentation from the new road system and this additional clearing of native vegetation will likely lead to increased annual invasives and require perpetual maintenance. 
"
"PROJ01","1 - General","PROJ","Project Description","Due to the nature of the lava features on the landscape, shallow soils and low precipitation,  it will be unlikely that reclamation efforts will completely restore the landscape to its original conditions. The effects of the roadwork and clearings are likely to become permanent features on the landscape. We recommend that the BLM take reference photos of the proposed corridors now so they can use them during site reclamation to approximate the original conditions. We recommend restoring the original topography, rock type, rock color, soils and native vegetation to the original conditions where practical. There may also be the opportunity to retain some of the roads following project completion if they can serve as a better transportation or recreation system route than the current road conditions. Any adoption of these routes should factor in wildlife and non-motorized recreation interests. 

Given the sparsity of deep soils and well developed topsoils in much of the project area, we recommend that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power start now to accumulate and store topsoil which can be used for eventual reclamation efforts. We also recommend investing now in seed collection and rearing of local varieties of native plants in greenhouses for eventual reclamation efforts. If operations at this site are renewed and reclamation efforts are not needed in thirty years, it is likely that there will be other restoration needs in the region for which the soils and native plants could be utilized. 

For eventual project reclamation, site preparation, replanting and revegetation efforts should be protected from adverse impacts from livestock grazing and off highway vehicles until the desired vegetation is well established."

"ALT02","2 - Suggested New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","The project as proposed would result in the construction of hundreds of wind turbines as tall as 740 feet high within the viewshed of the Minidoka National Historic Site. Multiple turbines are proposed to be constructed within the original internment camp allotment. In addition to the massive turbines themselves, which would cover 73,000 acres of BLM land, the proposed project includes seven new substations, a battery energy storage system, three operations and maintenance facilities, as well as new access roads, and new transmission lines to connect the generated power to the electric grid. The National Trust asserts that these actions would adversely impact Minidoka National Historic Site. To minimize or avoid these effects, we request that the BLM consider the following two alternatives in the DEIS: 

Reduced Scale Alternative 

The scale of the proposed project is so massive that a reduced number of turbines must be considered as an alternative. The stated goal of this project is “to construct and operate a commercial-scale wind energy facility that reliably and economically produces wind energy for delivery to power markets in the western United States”.1 An analysis of whether that goal can be achieved with a smaller project scale that avoids and minimizes impacts to Minidoka National Historic Site must be included in the Draft EIS. This alternative is notably not included in the “Preliminary Proposed Action and Alternatives” section of the NOI.  

Relocation Of Turbines Away From the Minidoka National Historic Site 

The “Preliminary Proposed Action and Alternatives” section of the NOI identifies “changes to facility layouts” as an alternative to be considered.2 The BLM has additionally made available to the National Trust maps that identify alternative sites for turbines in locations further away from the Minidoka National Historic Site than those currently proposed for use. The BLM must include one or more alternative(s) in the DEIS that locates all turbines as far away from Minidoka National Historic Site as possible, using every feasible alternative location to do so. The National Trust specifically requests that this alternative include the relocation of all turbines proposed for construction within the original internment camp allotment.  "

Once again, Americans native to this land (e.g., Shoshone Bannock, Shoshone-Paiute and other indigenous people) and others wronged by the U.S. Governments past discriminatory policies and programs will feel slammed again.  The damages caused by insensitive and discriminatory policies and actions  especially by our own legitimate government  is priceless.

 

Native Americans/American Indians and persons of Japanese ancestry were severely affected by the actions of the U.S. Government.  Both groups lost their original ways of life, and both felt the sting of a U.S. Government that actively worked to force them to assimilate by undermining their ethnic heritage and attempting to destroy cultural ways of life.  Now, the proposed 400 windmills show another example of profound disrespect and disregard to these groups by altering their sacred grounds, polluting their visual spaces and sound arenas, and disrupting abilities to honor and commemorate experiences that have significant historical and ethnic/cultural meaning.

"WILD02","2 - Big Game ","WILD","General Wildlife","I.	The EIS must document and analyze effects of the proposed project in its entirety on big game species found to use the planning area. The BLM must develop and consider alternatives that minimize or avoid negative impacts on these species.

Deer, elk, and pronghorn are culturally and economically important to Idaho’s citizens and communities.
These big game species travel upwards of 100 miles to reach favorable summer and winter ranges. Large, intact, and unfragmented habitats are required for big game species to successfully complete this wide range of movement and migration. The project area is utilized by each of these species, and the impacts to their habitat needs must be studied.

"REC03","3 - Hunting & Fishing","REC","Recreation and Visitor Services","III.	The EIS must study direct and indirect impacts to hunting and fishing opportunity and the
Region’s outdoor recreation economy.

Hunting, angling, and wildlife watching play a pivotal role in Idaho’s social and economic strength. In 2016, Idaho’s BLM lands saw 466,155 fishing visits, 296,596 hunting visits, and 193,571 wildlife-watching visits, generating $295 million in sales, $15 million in state and local tax revenue, and $18 million in federal tax revenue, while supporting more than 2,550 jobs. There is a strong correlation between Idaho’s strong hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching economies and vast unfragmented landscapes.

The TRCP worries the proposed project may cause a loss of opportunity for sportsmen in Idaho, both directly and indirectly. The project area lies within IDFG Game Management Unit (GMU) 53 where hunters can pursue game with short-range weapons as well as an archery season from August 30 to December 19.

The Lava Ridge Wind Project is proposed to have a footprint of more than 73,000 acres on an extensive tract of BLM-managed land with up to 400 wind turbines and 381 miles of access roads. This level of disturbance is significant and may disturb 22 percent of the total huntable BLM-lands within GMU 53.

With over 400 turbines up 750 ft. tall, some of which will be placed within the original site of the camp perimeter, and the associated transmission lines, this project will have a large impact on the viewshed of the National Historic Site. Given that the viewshed, particularly the vastness of the landscape around the camp, is one of the defining characteristic of the site and is mentioned in the draft Historic Landscape report, I expect that the BLM will engage in a constructive manner with the remaining prisoners that were placed in this camp or with there descendants to ensure that their concerns about the impacts this project will have on the Minidoka National Historic Site are addressed."

The only entities that will benefit from the wind farm are: an out of state company that will profit from it, out of state construction workers that will build it, states like California that will buy the energy produced by it, and countries like China that make the turbine parts for it. 

Do not sell out Idaho and do not succumb to this con job! NO, NO, NO!!!"
"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","The BLM, of course, is in charge of managing most of the land where the project is proposed. This land provides habitat for wildlife, food for livestock, and in this case, the atmosphere above the land supplies wind energy to power the proposed wind turbines. Furthermore, the BLM is charged with protecting archeological and historic sites, such as, Wilson Butte Cave and Minidoka Internment Camp. 

The land where this project is proposed is an ecosystem called ""Sagebrush Steppe,"" according to ""Sammy's Quest to Save the West.""2 This ecosystem is home to over 350 species of plants and animals. 

Our sagebrush ecosystem ... 
•	serves as a nursery that protects young elk, golden eagles, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, pygmy rabbits, and sagebrush lizards so that they can grow into strong adults
•	provides beautiful open spaces where people find fun, recreation, and renewal.
•	yields food for livestock and materials for roads, schools, homes, and cars.
•	contains energy resources to fuel the country's economy.
•	is part of western heritage.

In fact, other amphibians and reptiles that may be present on this land as evidenced in Amphibians and Reptiles of ldaho3 include western toad, sierran treefrog, boreal chorus frog, great basin spadefoot, northern leopard frog, longnose leopard lizard, western fence lizard, sagebrush lizard, short horned lizard, side blotched lizard, western whiptail, desert horned lizard, and western skink. Several snakes surely inhabit this ecosystem including the rubber boa, night snake, striped whipsnake and others. Not to mention the smaller organisms that occur here including insects, biocrust, and other sagebrush steppe obligates. A variety of plant species function as the producers in this sagebrush steppe ecosystem and must be preserved to enable these animals to exist here. 

As proposed, the Lava Ridge Wind Project includes ... 
•	400 wind generating turbines, with heights up to 740 feet
•	Up to 7 new substations
•	Approximately 250 miles of transmission lines
•	428 miles of roads
•	A battery energy storage system
•	Three operations and maintenance facilities
•	Five permanent met towers
•	Construction related staging yards

Approval of an energy project of this magnitude would have a severe net negative impact upon this almost virgin sagebrush steppe ecosystem. The well-being of this ecosystem must be the priority of this Environmental Impact Statement. 

Upon reviewing the Lava Ridge Wind Project map, I noticed the projected acreage of BLM land is almost totally confined by agricultural land. This small, fragile ecosystem would be highly fragmented (habitat fragmentation). The natural migration route of the BLM land between the agricultural land of Dietrich and that of Hidden Valley would be severely interrupted. There is also a natural migration route to the northwest, between Dietrich and Jerome ag land. In effect, the natural state of this land would be critically compromised if the Lava Ridge Wind Project were approved. "

Through its management planning process, the NPS identified Minidoka’s fundamental resources and values through its General Management Plan (GMP) and Foundation Document. With regard to the park boundary and adjacent land, the GMP describes an interpretive theme to include: “[t]he vastness, isolation, and open character of site’s desert environment that existed during the historic period are maintained through collaborative partnerships and cooperative efforts with surrounding landowners and others.”9 The Final GMP identifies NPS’s goals for Scenic Resource Management: “The NPS will collaborate with neighboring landowners to assist in the protection of historically significant distant views to the surrounding areas.”10

During the GMP public comment period, the NPS found that “[m]any of the respondents wanted to see the rural character and prominent landscape features of the surrounding landscape protected, particularly within the historic camp limits. Protection could be encouraged through cooperative agreements, such as conservation easements, conservation plans, and scenic conservation easements.” 

The NPS’s Record of Decision for the GMP states that “[o]n site education and interpretation will be accomplished through a wide range of visitor experiences, including immersion into the historic scene, interaction with a variety of educational and interpretive media and personal services, and participation in creative and self-directed activities.”11 The ROD also states that NPS will develop on-site interpretive exhibits including the reconstruction of the honor roll, guard tower, flag-pole, and barbed-wire fence. As part of its management planning process, the NPS also completed a Foundation Document, which states the park’s fundamental resources and values including:

Environmental Setting: “Minidoka’s remote location in the high desert of Idaho provides an immersive setting that is fundamental to the visitor experience. Views of open fields and distant mountains create a sense of isolation on a vast landscape where Minidoka once stood…Extreme changes in temperature, the arid environment, and high winds that the people at Minidoka experienced are part of the environmental setting that are felt today. Experiencing this environmental setting allows visitors to better understand and connect to the daily lives at Minidoka.”
● Commemoration and Healing: Minidoka provides a place “… for engagement, reflection,
and healing. These sites provoke connections to individuals affected by the World War II exclusion, forced removal, and unjust incarceration, and serves to commemorate those who
survived this difficult chapter of American history.”
● Public Understanding, Education, and Involvement: “Educating and engaging the public in understanding the history of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II,
the fragile nature of civil rights, and the need to protect civil and constitutional rights in the United States is essential...At Minidoka, special events such as the pilgrimage and the civil
liberties symposium connect the public to the history that occurred here and its significance today.”12

In addition to the Organic Act, Minidoka’s authorizing legislation directs the Secretary to interpret “the living conditions of the relocation centers.” As noted above, an important interpretive 13 theme is to maintain “the vastness, isolation, and open character of the site’s desert environment that existed during the historic period.” 14 Minidoka’s authorizing legislation also requires that Minidoka NHS shall be administered in accordance with the Historic Sites Act of 1935.15 The Historic Sites Act states that “it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States.”"

Concern: With increased commercial activity, a rise in OHV trespass and damage to cultural resources could be anticipated at the western end of the Craters of the Moon National Preserve. The park has minimal visitor support infrastructure in this part of the park, including no fee stations or water sources, and infrequent ranger patrols. Ground disturbance both from the construction project itself and from OHV use may bring new invasive plant infestations into the park, especially to the 500 kipukas, isolated islands of pristine and undisturbed vegetation communities interspersed between the lava flow. The park is not able to monitor for invasive plants on the western end.

Recommendation: The NPS recommends using best available science to analyze probable increases in OHV damage and cultural resource threats with increased commercial and other activity in the area. The NPS recommends that the BLM and NPS partner to create a monitoring program that would identify and mitigate increased visitation patterns, OHV use or trespass, cultural and natural resource damage, and invasive plant populations in the western end of Craters of the Moon and surrounding BLM lands."
"DECI08","8 - Relationship to Policies, Plans, and Programs","DECI","Decision Process","President Biden made his Administration’s policies and priorities clear starting on day one. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 13985 entitled “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government.” In calling for a “whole-of-government equity agenda,” President Biden stated an Administration goal to advance racial equity: “…for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Affirmatively advancing
equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government. Because advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in
decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity.” The Racial Justice E.O. defines “equity” to include the Asian American Pacific Island (AAPI) community. Because the Japanese American community has received unequal treatment by the government and BLM is an agency in the federal government, this E.O. applies to BLM and its land management planning. In carrying out the President’s Racial Justice E.O., Secretary Haaland announced a Department of the Interior budget initiative in the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget request. Entitled 1 “Promoting Racial Justice and Equity for Underserved Communities,” the Department’s FY 2022 discretionary request “…will embed environmental justice and racial equity goals into programs across the Department, with discrete investments in key areas. For example, the request includes an additional $20 million to expand access to the over 70 national park units that preserve and tell the story of historically underrepresented and marginalized groups…”

The DOI’s $20 million racial justice initiative includes a proposed $210,000 base budget funding increase for Minidoka to “… support operations and maintenance of the visitor center in order to provide quality visitor services … The new visitor center, dedicated in 2020, is a significant part of the site’s visitor experience.” We are grateful for the Secretary’s support for additional staffing for 2 Minidoka to ensure that the stories of people of color are told.

On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008, entitled “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.” The Climate Crisis E.O. states the goals of the Administration to reduce climate pollution and deliver environmental justice.3 The E.O. also states that: “[s]uccessfully meeting these challenges will require the Federal Government to pursue such a coordinated approach from planning to implementation, coupled with substantive engagement by stakeholders, including State, local, and Tribal governments.” Emphases added.

To carry out this guidance from the President, Secretary Haaland issued Secretarial Order 3399, entitled a “Department-Wide Approach to the Climate Crisis and Restoring Transparency and Integrity to the Decision-Making Process.” The Secretary’s Order clearly requires BLM to engage with stakeholders early in the planning process, before a decision to prepare an environmental impact statement:

""Bureaus/Offices will proactively begin consultation with potentially impacted Tribes, both those currently in the proposed area and those with a historic presence, as well as engage potentially
impacted environmental justice communities early in the project planning process. ‘Early in the project planning process’ includes when a Bureau/Office has enough information on a proposed
action to determine that an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement will be prepared."" Section 5(C) Emphases added.

In addition to Executive and Secretarial Orders, the Biden Administration stated its goals through its American Jobs Plan released in March 2021. In the section entitled “Spur jobs modernizing power generation and delivering clean electricity,” the Administration outlined several initiatives and stated: “[a]ll of this will be done while ensuring those facilities meet robust and rigorous standards for worker, public, and environmental safety as well as environmental justice – and all while moving toward 100 percent carbon-pollution free power by 2035.” Emphases added."

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","5. RECOMMENDATION THAT BLM STUDY MEASURES TO PERMANENTLY PROTECT MINIDOKA’S FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCES AND VALUES FROM LAVA RIDGE AND FUTURE THREATS

During the pre-planning process, we encourage BLM to consider affirmative protective measures to provide long-term protections for the park’s visual and other resources. These measures could include:

Land Use Plan Amendment. We encourage BLM to use its authority under FLPMA to consider protective measures on BLM lands located both within and outside the historic footprint of Minidoka. The Friends of Minidoka is prepared to work with BLM and other partners in BLM’s land use planning process.  

Secretarial authority provided by the Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) Act of 2006. As noted above, Section 1(a) of Public Law 109-411 gives the Secretary of the Interiority authority to: “create a program within the National Park Service to encourage, support, recognize, and work in partnership with … Federal agencies … for the purpose of … protecting …historic confinement sites,” including the 33,000 acre historic footprint of Minidoka.

 In addition to the existing JACS grant program, we encourage the Secretary to direct NPS to expand the JACS program to include working with BLM and other partners to protect Minidoka and other former relocation centers, so “that present and future generations may learn and gain inspiration from these sites and that these sites will demonstrate the Nation’s commitment to equal justice under the law.” 21

Minidoka National Register Nomination. As noted above, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the former manager of the Minidoka site, prepared a National Register nomination to add a small portion of Minidoka to the National Register. Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act places an affirmative responsibility on federal agencies to manage and maintain historic properties under their jurisdiction or control. Furthermore, this section provides that historic properties not under agency jurisdiction or control but potentially affected by agency actions are to be fully considered in agency planning.

Since BLM owns and manages lands both within and outside the historic camp footprint, it has an affirmative responsibility under Section 110 to determine the lands’ eligibility for listing through its association with Minidoka. Furthermore, while private ownership of portions of the landscape is a complicating factor, mixed ownership is not automatically disqualifying for listing on the National Register. As part of the current planning and consultation process, we ask that BLM assess the eligibility of the original 33,000-acre Minidoka landscape for listing on the National Register, in conjunction with its land use planning process for lands located outside of the historic footprint."

See 40 CFR § 1508.8 (“Effects include ecological, aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative.”).
Protected public lands such as national parks can play an important economic role for local communities. The economic benefits of national parks extend beyond tourism. The greatest value of natural amenities and recreation opportunities often lies in the ability of protected lands to attract and retain people, entrepreneurs, businesses, and retirees.
According to National Park Service visitation data, Craters of the Moon and Minidoka received a combined 285,871 visits in 2019. Visitation for both parks has been steadily increasing over the past decade. BLM must consult these data and consider trends in visitation and how the proposed project would affect those trends."
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","•	Conception rates may be reduced in sheep and cattle. Animal stress incurred as a result of construction disturbances causes early and late term abortions. In addition, intact males (bulls and bucks) may experience reduced libido, inhibiting natural breeding. Increased disturbances will also keep intact males away from females reaching estrus. Further, breeding disturbances will result in late lambs and calves which reduces weaning weights and affects overall operation profitability. Later pregnancies result in females that are always behind in breeding cycles, affecting uniformity of calf and lamb crops and an ensuing profit reduction for ranch families.
•	Increased stress will lead to decreased weaning weights in calves and lambs as a result from the initial development phases of the wind project activities.
•	Decreased Body Condition Scores (BCS) in cattle and sheep may be reduced as a result of lost forage production and stressors from construction activity. This could also possibly equate to additional feeding costs when livestock are removed from the allotment and taken to home operations. The additional feeding costs are a direct result of having to increase pounds fed per day to achieve optimum BCS for calving and lambing seasons since animals may lose one to two BCS from increased stress due to project activities.
•	A loss of useable grazing acreage due to construction of new access roads, wind turbine sites, and forage production (lbs./ac) loss due to disturbances, and increased populations of invasive species, annual species, and other undesirable vegetation will impact livestock grazing by decreasing desirable forage production.
•	A potential risk of decreased stocking rates resulting in a reduction of AUM's for permittees, further decreasing family ranch income may result."

Pursuant to the NHPA, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation worked to add a portion of the former Minidoka Relocation Center to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The National Register nomination states that:

“The ruins of Camp Minidoka … are tangible reminders of one of the most serious and painful contradictions of our country's philosophy of freedom. Through a nefarious legal fiction, over 110,000 loyal Americans were wrenched from their homes and forcefully detained without due process of law, in bleak, barbed-wire enclosed camps scattered over isolated inland areas on desolate tracts of Federal land. The concrete slabs, dilapidated shacks, and scattered refuse surrounded by rich farmland—much of it reclaimed by the camp's inmates, is also a memorial to the suffering and remarkable courage of the Japanese-Americans of that time. Despite being less than 50-years old, this site represents an exceptional chapter in the history of the United States that should always be remembered. Commemoration of this event should take place before memories fade and the sharpness of the event is dulled by time.”

The park also actively monitors the greater sage grouse and helps to preserve sagebrush steppe habitat the species depends on.

Concern: Habitat fragmentation resulting from road development and powerlines have the potential to negatively impact native mammals and birds found in the park. The Project is proposing up to 381 miles of new roads and 250 miles of transmission lines to the area. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game has identified the section of Highway 24 adjacent to the proposed project footprint as a wildlife linkage for mule deer, pronghorn, medium-sized carnivores, and sage grouse (Wildlife Linkage Report for Idaho Transportation Districts 3, 4, & 5).

We request analysis of all impacts to important historical locations connected to Minidoka."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Minidoka NHS is a nationally significant site related to civil rights and liberties and American history. The site represents the exclusion and unjust incarceration experience of 13,000 Nikkei – Japanese American citizens and legal residents of Japanese ancestry – forcibly removed from their homes, businesses, and communities in the lush environments of the Pacific Coast (Washington, Oregon, California, and Alaska) and relocated to the isolated and remote high desert landscape of southern Idaho during World War II. Minidoka was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 18, 1979 and designated a unit of the national park system on January 17, 2001. The park currently preserves approximately 500 acres of the original 33,000-acre Minidoka War Relocation Center and offers opportunities for the public education and interpretation of the stories and lives of the individuals incarcerated there and its important civil rights lessons.

The isolated inland setting embodied the perceived need to remove Japanese Americans from the West Coast and the expectation that security would be easier to enforce in an isolated location. This remote high desert and agrarian setting surrounding Minidoka NHS is a highly significant and a defining characteristic of the incarceration experience and is central to the park’s historic integrity today. The original site included over 33,000 acres that the incarcerated Japanese Americans were expected to clear of sagebrush, irrigate, and bring into agricultural use for food production to support Minidoka’s population and to develop the land for long-term homesteading and “land reclamation.”

The Lava Ridge Wind Project has the potential to adversely affect the setting, feeling, and association of Minidoka NHS, three of the seven aspects of integrity of a historic property as defined by the National Register of Historic Places. The turbines would be taller than any existing structures in the State of Idaho and would dwarf all structures in the vicinity of Minidoka NHS. The turbines would encompass 114 degrees of the 360-degree horizon at the Minidoka Visitor Center and viewshed analyses indicate 324 of the proposed 400 turbines would be visible from the Minidoka Visitor Center (at the high end of turbine heights under consideration). These large-scale changes on the landscape could diminish if not prevent entirely the ability of the site to convey its historic character. Definitions of the seven aspects of integrity can be found in National Register Bulletin 15.

Setting is the physical environment of a historic property. A central characteristic of Minidoka National Historic Site’s integrity and historical significance is its setting in a remote and open expanse of agricultural fields northeast of Twin Falls, Idaho. The proposed Lava Ridge Wind Project and its accompanying field of towering, mechanical turbines could alter the open character and expansive views of this isolated agrarian location that compose the historic setting of the property. Feeling refers to a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time and results from the presence of physical features that, taken together, convey the property’s historic character. Today Minidoka NHS conveys feelings of isolation and abandonment, expressing a sense of the desolation experienced by Japanese Americans during the incarceration period. The feeling of the site evokes the victimization, injustice, and racism that are important aspects of the site’s history. After the wind project is built, visitors to the historic site may no longer experience the feelings of wide-open spaces devoid of large-scale development characteristic of the incarceration period and agricultural and reclamation projects of the twentieth century. In this way, the presence of turbines, transmission towers, collection lines, battery storage facilities, maintenance facilities, and substations could impact the feeling of the site.

Association is the direct link between an important historic event or person and a historic property. The site selection for the Minidoka Relocation Center directly links to association, as Minidoka met the War Relocation Authority’s site selection criteria and was one of the earliest sites selected (Cultural Landscape
 
Inventory, Page 37-38). The War Relocation Authority’s criteria included large tracts of public land in remote locations away from “strategic works” that could provide year-round work opportunities. Other criteria included land available for agriculture, access to water, remoteness from population centers, and close proximity to railroads for shipment of materials and the Japanese American populations.

The Lava Ridge Wind Project could adversely affect Minidoka NHS’s ability to convey its association with: (1) the Japanese American incarceration experience; and (2) the site’s contribution to southern Idaho’s agricultural history and development. The openness and undeveloped landscape are vital to the historic character and purpose of Minidoka NHS. These defining characteristics: expansiveness,
remoteness, high desert, and agrarian terrain, convey the government’s site criteria and the long-lasting effects of that intentional decision-making process. The site still evokes vivid memories and strong emotions from Nikkei who were incarcerated there almost 80 years ago.

Incarcerated Japanese Americans at Minidoka transformed the undeveloped arid land into irrigated agricultural fields characteristic of the area today. Following the closure of the Minidoka Relocation Center in 1945, the agricultural lands within and around the camp were subdivided into homesteads and auctioned off (Japanese Americans were excluded from participating in these land auctions). The transformation of the area to an emergent agricultural community was quick and efficient, as most of the lands had already been cleared during construction of the Relocation Center and then by incarcerated Japanese Americans for agricultural production.

Minidoka NHS includes the property that was part of the “Farm-in-a-Day” initiative, a significant historical event that marked a cooperative effort between the local community, state and federal government, and the private agricultural industry to establish and demonstrate modern agricultural techniques and equipment. The event represents an important connection between the camp, how the land parcels were treated following the decommission of the camp, and the development of agriculture in southern Idaho.

The visual and cultural intrusion of the wind project could fundamentally diminish the historic character of the landscape as undeveloped, open country that was intentionally chosen to separate Japanese Americans from the nation, and the rural agricultural landscape following the incarceration period.

Concern: The NPS is concerned that the project has potential to impact the soundscape as experienced by incarcerated Japanese Americans at the site during World War II. Industrial-scale construction activity, traffic, and blasting of the basalt substrate for over 400 infrastructure foundations would bring unprecedented noise levels to the area. Ongoing wind turbine operation would produce audible low- frequency noise throughout the 30-year life of the project. (Chiu & Lung, 2020).

Recommendation: The NPS recommends that acoustic conditions be evaluated against the natural ambient sound level (Lnatural), defined as the sound level which would exist in an environment without contributions from human sources.

"CUL04","4 - Japanese American Concerns","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","Ethnographic groups are people who for two generations or more have used or appreciated the resources of a place for work, religion, recreation, education, or other traditions that help retain their cultural identity. The Japanese American community has more than two generations with cultural identity and traditions around Minidoka NHS. Minidoka NHS is a site of conscience, a place of memory that prevents the erasing of the past to ensure a more just and humane future, and a member of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience. The site offers opportunities to make connections between past injustices inflicted upon Japanese Americans during World War II by the federal government and contemporary human rights issues. Minidoka NHS is a pilgrimage site for Japanese American survivors and their descendants, with organized commemorative events happening at Minidoka since 1979. As stated in the Minidoka NHS Foundation Document, “commemoration and healing” and “public understanding, education, and involvement” are fundamental values of Minidoka NHS.

Concern: Development of half-mile-wide corridors of wind turbines across more than 200,000 acres of southern Idaho lands could restrict Native American access to key ethnographic resources potentially impacting treaty-reserved rights. The proposed power generation corridors and infrastructure also have the potential to adversely affect the traditional cultural and religious values associated with any Indian sacred sites that may be within or near the project area. The natural soundscape is often a contributing element to the significance of ethnographic and spiritual resources. Noise created during turbine operation, persistent across the entire 30-year lifespan of the project, may intrude on the quietness and natural soundscapes intrinsic to the cultural values associated with these kinds of resources.

For Japanese American survivors and their descendants, Minidoka is a sacred site. The first organized commemorative event was held in 1979 with a large ceremony associated with the designation of the site on the National Register of Historic Places. Subsequent pilgrimages occurred between 1979 and 2003, at which time the event transitioned to an annual event attended by survivors, descendants, and friends.
Since 2003, hundreds of survivors and their descendants have attended the annual pilgrimages, coming from as far away as Japan. The Lava Ridge Wind Farm project may negatively affect the desire of Minidoka’s survivors and descendants to make personal pilgrimages to Minidoka or to attend the annual pilgrimage. The Lava Ridge Project could impact their ability to consider Minidoka as a site of healing, commemoration, and reconciliation, where the government admitted a wrong by preserving the site and interpreting it for its civil rights lessons.

Japanese Americans continue to have associations with specific natural features of the project area. These associations have been recorded through oral histories and are passed down through oral traditions.
Historically, incarcerated Japanese Americans collected greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) and sagebrush for furniture and artistic projects. Greasewood objects from Minidoka and the stories associated with them are passed down from the survivors to descendants and the larger Japanese American community. Examples include the use of collected greasewood in the model apartment at Minidoka designed and built by world famous furniture designer, George Nakashima, and greasewood objects from Minidoka in the collections of Japanese American families (Nakashima, 1981). Similarly, incarcerated Japanese Americans collected large lava rocks for inclusion in Japanese style gardens in the developed areas of the camp, such as the Kogita garden and the entrance garden designed by famed garden designer
 
Fujitaro Kubota (Minidoka Cultural Landscape Report; Eaton, 1952; Tamura, 2013). The large lava rocks from the Kogita garden were transported to Seattle following WWII and are elements of the family’s Japanese-style garden in Seattle.

The possibility of 700 or more workers with their families moving into the area during a two (2) year construction period is a concerning and a difficult impact to deal with. It is presented as a financial plus to the area, however preparing for and dealing with the stated influx is difficult at best.

wrong, moved citizens and legal immigrants to a camp with only what they could carry, and evicted them with only the 
same. The archaeological traces of these experiences are fleeting, and archaeological preservation of the traces that

although most of that conversion never was successful. A visual intrusion into this landscape is potentially a substantial 
adverse impact to this sense of place. If visual impact cannot be avoided, I strongly suggest that the Wind Project assess

Minidokas remote location and vast landscape immerses visitors in the experience of the incarcerees. The massive Lava Ridge Wind Project will greatly impact the environmental setting and experience for visitors, overbearing and essentially swallowing this site and its history.

We are not against renewable energy. We ask that you consider another site for the Lava Ridge Wind Project, that wont destroy this sacred place of healing for our community and powerful educational tool for everyone. Having Minidoka protected and preserved and accessible for visitors is crucial to protecting and preserving American history."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Ordinarily I would be supportive of renewable energy projects such as wind turbines.
However, as an American whose taxes support national parks, I do not support the Lava Ridge wind farm near the Minidoka National Historic Site.  It strikes me as unfortunate that an east coast entity wants to relegate Pacific Northwest history to simply a revenue generator for its stakeholders, ignoring the importance and rele-vance of this area, in conjunction with the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Looking at topographic maps of the area, there certainly seems to be large swaths of public land elsewhere in this area for this east coast based private equity firm to set up their wind farm. If we must use our public lands to allow private stakeholders to generate revenue by shipping power to other states, at least let us respect and honor this place and especially its meaning for Americans of Japanese descent and not treat it as expendable, as “less than.”  In an era where anti-Asian sentiment has again gathered steam, let’s fight against that by not allow-ing the Minidoka National Historic Site to be permanently altered. Let’s not strip away dignity yet again."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","And to understand the meaning of that atrocity, we need to comprehend that the Minidoka National Historic Site is every bit as important as the Washington Monument.

In Idaho there are vast desert areas where these wind turbines could be built.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The remoteness of Minidoka (and other American concentration camps) is a fundamental part of its cultural history. Japanese Americans were rounded up and corralled into the most desolate, undeveloped parts of America. 

A wind farm project of the scale proposed by the Lava Ridge investors, with towers higher than the Space Needle in Seattle and turbine blades the width of a 747 airplane, would destroy the sense of isolation, cut off from civilization; that characterized Minidoka then and today. That is an important part of visitors experience, to understand and perceive first-hand what it was like to be expelled to a lonely, primitive place like the Minidoka concentration camp. And how, in spite of all the hardships, Japanese Americans relegated there managed to rebuild a temporary semblance of community, contribute to the war effort by producing food for Minidoka itself and other camps as well; how they endured and persevered in the inhospitable and isolated site. 

So, I feel it is important that the Wind Farm turbines within the viewshed of the Minidoka Historical Site be re-sited in order to not affect the space that holds great meaning for Japanese Americans and all people who believe it is necessary to remember the past in order to not repeat it. "
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","But the overwhelming scale and proximity of the Lava Ridge Wind Project would negatively affect Minidoka as a meaningful historic and cultural site, and the lessons it preserves. The huge turbines should be located outside of the viewshed of Minidoka. I hope that smaller-scale projects, especially those that might be owned by indigenous tribes and local farmers (and using not only wind but also solar power) can take the place of the commercial mega-wind farm proposed by LS Power within the footprint of the Minidoka camp. 

The bottom line is that industrial-sized alternative energy projects can  and should  be developed in areas with less cultural and environmental impact and more direct benefit to users and local stakeholders, but the Minidoka Historic Site cannot. It is a unique and unmovable site that has great historical and cultural values that we must preserve as much as we must seek alternatives to our old habits of profligate burning of fossil fuels."

"AIR01","1 - General","AIR","Air Quality","Air quality is an important component of the overall NPS visitor experience. Craters of the Moon NM&P is located in one of the countries’ cleanest air regions and is a Congressionally designated Class 1 park under the Clean Air Act. The park considers clean air a fundamental resource and value making it an attribute essential to achieving the purpose of the park and maintaining its significance. Clean air enhances the color and contrast of landscape features, allows visitors to see great distances (well over 100 miles on a clear day), provides panoramic views of the naturally dark night skies, and safeguards ecosystem, visitor, and staff health (Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Foundation Document).

Concern: The NPS is concerned that the construction of over 400 infrastructure foundations and over 381 miles of new roads for this Project could generate emissions from construction traffic and heavy construction equipment, and dust from rock blasting and soil disturbance. Currently, the overall air quality at Craters of the Moon NM&P is in fair condition based on available data (visibility, ozone for human health, ozone for vegetation health, nitrogen deposition, sulfur deposition, and particulate matter); however, the overall air quality trend is deteriorating (NPS Park Conditions & Trends). The predominant wind direction to the park is from the southwest (https://www.nps.gov/crmo/faqs.htm). Emissions from trucks and airborne dust may travel from the project area to Craters of the Moon NM&P, further deteriorating visibility and other air quality related values.

Recommendations: The NPS recommends that the BLM coordinate closely with the air quality management district and the National Park Service on cumulative emissions, visual impacts, and monitoring and mitigation opportunities, given the proximity of Craters of the Moon, a Class I air quality park. Additionally:

•	Consider the erodibility of the 40 soil types found in the Project area and avoid the more erodible soil types within the half-mile wide corridor where infrastructure is planned. 
•	Include a table summarizing future annual cumulative emissions, broken out by year, for the project and surrounding agricultural operations. Compare these cumulative emissions to both de minimis thresholds and daily emission thresholds.
•	Require the use of Tier 3, Tier 4, or higher engines for all construction equipment. Conduct a survey to confirm the availability of Tier 4 engines for project construction to support the emissions estimates.
•	Require the installation of real-time PM10 dust monitoring equipment to continually monitor during both the construction and operational phases of the project. Creating a network of real- time monitors would provide the data necessary to inform mitigation and adaptation measures as construction progresses.
•	Consider adopting a mitigation measure to limit on-site idling of off-road equipment. A similar mitigation measure was recently adopted by the BLM for the Crimson Solar Project (Air Quality Mitigation Measure 3) in the Record of Decision."

In addition, lamb loss will increase by 50% as a result of reduced predator control options. The reason being is that wind turbines essentially limit sheep producer's ability to use aerial support for predator control. As a result, predator populations will increase. Additionally, an increased incidence of twin lamb separation from the ewe will increase. The ewe will not find the lost lamb which results in death of the lost lamb. Since most ewes produce twins, this results in a minimum 50% reduction in lamb crop.

BLM must thoroughly document and analyze the potential impacts on nearby protected lands in this EIS and use that analysis to ultimately adopt a decision that does not authorize wind energy development that would adversely impact the resources and values of Craters of the Moon or Minidoka.

The construction of an industrial site directly neighboring these national treasures will cause significant impacts to each of these units and will irreparably impair the very values these park units were designated to protect in perpetuity.

Migratory bat species make up the majority of bat fatalities caused by wind energy facilities (Choi, Wittig and Kluever, 2020; Friedenberg and Frick, 2021; Thompson et al 2017).

Concern: The NPS is concerned about eagles, songbirds, and bats that are either resident to or that migrate through Craters of the Moon NM&P and use the proposed project footprint area for foraging or migration. More than 100 bird species, including golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), have been documented to nest at Craters of the Moon NM&P.

•	The NPS requests that the BLM publish a project integration schedule in the DEIS to clarify the timing, sequencing and interrelationships of ongoing compliance and regulatory processes. The project integration schedule would include timing-related aspects for preparing and finalizing the DEIS, FEIS/ROD, Administrative Appeals, consultation under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, FAA permitting, the Plan of Development and similar. The Lava Ridge Wind project is extremely complex. The BLM would be able to disclose how the various pieces of the project are interrelated and provide real-time updates to the project sequence. This additional layer of transparency and communication would contribute towards the resolution of the project’s adverse effects.

"VIS02","2 - Night Sky / Dark Sky","VIS","Visual Resources","Night skies are a critical component of natural, cultural, and historic resources across the NPS. The night skies at Minidoka NHS contribute directly to the sense of isolation those incarcerated felt and are thus integral to its cultural and historical setting, feeling, and association.

While the BLM and LS Power provided some public notice in the immediate project area in south central Idaho, we are not aware of any outreach to the Japanese American community located on the West Coast or nationwide before the August 2021 Federal Register Notice.

Because of U.S. Government policy during World War II, which destroyed entire Japanese American communities on the West Coast and dispersed families across the country, Minidoka survivors and their descendants are located in communities across the United States. Densho, a Seattle-based non-profit organization, has chronicled this diaspora in its Sites of Shame website. The map below shows where people settled after Minidoka and sought to rebuild their lives against the backdrop of racial prejudice and hate. While many Japanese Americans resettled after WW II in Oregon, Washington State, Alaska and California, many Minidoka survivors and their families live throughout the United States.

The proposed project assumes the existence of wind to support a Wind Project, like that proposed by Magic Valley Energy. However, the wind potential to support a Wind Project upon the public lands within the Star Lake Allotment is non-existent in some parts and low in other parts, according to a Wind study by the U.S. Department of the Interior. This Wind study is reported in the “Record of Decision” dated December 15, 2005, for “Implementation of a Wind Energy Development Project and Associated Land Use Plan Amendments” issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior (“2005 ROD-Wind”) within it associated “Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on Wind Energy Development on BLM-Administrated Lands in Western United States” in June 2005 (“2005 FPEIS-Wind”). The 2005 FPEIS-Wind identified the “Wind Resource Potential” within the area of the Star Lake Allotment, as well as adjacent areas, as follows:


2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume 2, Appendix B, at page B-60 (Map of “Burley, Idaho; BLM Field Office; Wind Resource Potential”, wherein the area encircled in fuchsia is the approximate
 
location of the Star Lake Allotment). This Map illustrates, as noted, that the “Wind Resource Potential” within the area of the Star Lake Allotment is non-existence in some parts and low in other parts, but that areas beyond the boundary of the Star Lake Allotment to the southeast and to the southwest have “Medium” and “High” wind resource potential. See 2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume 2, Appendix B, at page B-60.

BLM favorably cited the 2005 ROD-Wind and the 2005 FPEIS-Wind as part of its final rule-making in issuing new regulations as to “Leasing Public Lands for Solar and Wind Energy Development”. See also 81 Fed.Reg. 92122, 92125 (12/19/2016). BLM stated during final rule- making:

On June 24, 2005, the BLM published the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on Wind Energy Development on BLM-Administered Lands in the Western United States (Wind Programmatic EIS) (70 FR 36651), which analyzed the environmental impact of the development of wind energy projects on public lands in the West and identified approximately 20.6 million acres of public lands with wind energy development potential (http://windeis.anl.gov).
Following the publication of the Wind Programmatic EIS, the BLM issued the ROD for Implementation of a Wind Energy Development Program and Associated Land Use Plan Amendments (Wind Programmatic EIS ROD) (71 FR 1768), which amended 48 BLM land use plans. The Wind Programmatic EIS ROD did not identify specific wind energy development leasing areas, but rather identified areas that have potential for the development of wind energy production facilities, along with areas excluded from consideration for wind energy facility development because of other resource values that are incompatible with that use.

81 Fed.Reg. 92125 (12/19/2016) (emphasis supplied).

Based upon the 2005 ROD-Wind and 2005 FPEIS-Wind, particularly as recently cited / ratified by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2016, it is apparent that the viability and feasibility of a Wind Project is not practicable in the Star Lake Allotment, but it likely would be practicable in other locations outside of the Star Lake Allotment, as illustrated in the Map above. See 2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume 2, Appendix B, at page B-60. In fact, under information and belief, Magic Valley Energy has another proposal south of the Star Lake Allotment within or near the Berger Allotment, Burley Field Office, Twin Falls District, Idaho. BLM and Magic Valley Energy are urged to pursue a Wind Project in another location outside of the administrative boundary of the Star Lake Allotment. Should BLM and Magic Valley Energy desire to continue to pursue a Wind Project within the Star Lake Allotment, it is apparent any NEPA document should assess a “No Action” Alternative (given the lack of wind resource potential within the area of the Star Lake Allotment).

All management actions must conform to the applicable Land Use Plan. 43 C.F.R. § 1610.5-3(a) (10-1-2019 Edition) states that “[a[ll future resource management authorizations and actions … shall conform to the approved plan.” See also Federal Land Policy and Management Act, 43 U.S.C. § 1712. 43 C.F.R. §§ 2802.11(b)(1) (10-1-2019 Edition) adds further direction, stating that “[w]hen determining which lands may be suitable for right-of-way corridors or designated leasing areas, the factors the BLM considers include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Federal, state, and local land use plans …”. See 43 C.F.R. §§ 2801.2(c), 2802.10(a)(3), 2802.11(a), 2804.35(a)(4), 2809.19(a) (10-1-2019 Edition); see also 43 C.F.R. §§
2801.5(b) (10-1-2019 Edition) (wherein “Designated leasing area means a parcel of land with specific boundaries identified by the BLM land use planning process as being a preferred location for solar or wind energy development that may be offered competitively”, and wherein “Screening criteria for solar and wind energy development refers to the policies and procedures that the BLM uses to prioritize how it processes solar and wind energy development right-of-way applications to facilitate the environmentally responsible development of such facilities through the consideration of resource conflicts, land use plans, and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Applications for projects with lesser resource conflicts are anticipated to be less costly and time-consuming for the BLM to process and will be prioritized over those with greater resource conflicts”).

Here, under information and belief, the applicable land use plan is the Monument Resource Management Plan dated January 1986 (“Monument RMP”), as amended by the following amendments:

(1)	Record of Decision dated August 20, 2003, relating to Land Tenure Adjustment and Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (“2003 ROD-Land Tenure”);

(2)	Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendments for the Great Basin Region, including the Greater Sage-Grouse Sub-Regions of Idaho and S.W. Montana, Nevada and N.E. California, Oregon, and Utah dated September 15, 2015 (“2015 ROD-ARMPA”);

(3)	Attachment I to the 2015 ROD-ARMPA dated September 15, 2015, relating to the Idaho and S.W. Montana Greater Sage-Grouse Resource Management Plan Amendment (“2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA”); and,

(4)	Idaho Greater Sage-Grouse Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment dated March 14, 2019 (“2019 Idaho ROD- ARMPA”), as reaffirmed by the Idaho Record of Decision for the Greater Sage-
 
Grouse Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement dated December 30, 2020 (“2020 Idaho ROD-SEIS”).1

Permittees use the words “under information and belief” because we welcome you to confirm the status of the applicable land use plan. We want to be certain as to the controlling / applicable land use plan covering the public lands within the Star Lake Allotment. We are not 100% certain because we are informed that the 2019 Idaho ROD-ARMPA was enjoined from implementation by W. Watersheds Project v. Schneider, 417 F. Supp. 3d 1319 (D. Idaho 2019). However, such court decision was issued before issuance of the 2020 Idaho ROD-SEIS, and we read the 2020 Idaho ROD-SEIS as intending to correct any mistakes in the 2019 Idaho ROD-ARMPA and to reaffirm the 2019 Idaho ROD-ARMPA. It is possible this uncertainty may have been a topic of discussion between BLM and Magic Valley Energy in the “first meeting” as required by 43
C.F.R. § 2804.12(b)(4)(i) (10-1-2019 Edition), wherein at the “first meeting” between an applicant and BLM requires a discussion of “… the status of BLM land use planning for the lands involved …”.

Assuming the applicable land use plan is the Monument RMP, as amended only by the 2003 ROD-Land Tenure, 2015 ROD-ARMPA, and the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA, then the Permittees don’t find any explicit management direction for wind energy in the Monument RMP.

1 We do not find that the applicable land use plan covering the Star Lake Allotment was amended by the 2005 ROD-Wind. The 2005 ROD-Wind amended several land use plans related to wind energy across the 11-State study area of the 2005 FPEIS-Wind including within Idaho.
In fact, as to Idaho, the 2005 ROD-Wind amended seven (7) land use plans, though one of them was not the Monument RMP. See 2005 ROD-Wind, Appendix B, at pages B-3 to B-4. Based thereon, the Permittees do not find the 2005 ROD-Wind amended the Monument RMP or otherwise provides any land use planning direction relative to the intended Project. See 2005 ROD-Wind, Appendix B, at pages B-3 to B-4. However, with that said, it is compelling to note that the 2005 ROD-Wind, Attachment A, at page A-2, relating to “BLM Wind Energy Development Program Policies and Best Management Practices” included a policy statement that “[t]o the extent possible, wind energy projects shall be developed in a manner that will not prevent other land uses, including minerals extraction, livestock grazing, recreational use, and other ROW uses” (emphasis supplied). See also 2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume 1, pages 2-5, 4-33.
 
However, the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA includes in Table 2-1 a “Summary of Allocation Decisions by GRSG Habitat Management Areas”, noting the following as to Wind Resources:

2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA, Table 2-1, at page 2-3; see also 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA, Table 1- 6, at page 1-11. This would indicate that the areas within a General Habitat Management Area or GHMA are open for Wind Energy development subject to conformance with other provisions in the applicable land use plan, including the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA.

Here, the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA discloses that the public lands within the Star Lake Allotment are within a GHMA (which is encircled in yellow), though the Permittees request from BLM a site-specific map of the sage-grouse habitat areas within the Star Lake Allotment. The 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA illustrates the following:

2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA, Figure 1-2, at page 1-3.

Assuming the Star Lake Allotment is within a GHMA, the Permittees note several management directions associated with Wind Energy development within the 2015 Idaho ROD- ARMPA which must be followed by any intended Project, as follows:

•	Section 2.1.1 -- Special Status Species: Goal SSS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Objective SSS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; MD SSS 27 (Anthropogenic Disturbance); and

•	Section 2.2.7 –Renewable Energy (Wind and Solar): MD RE 1 (wherein it is stated that “GHMA (Idaho): Designate and manage GHMA as open for wind and solar testing and development and nuclear and hydropower development subject to RDFs and buffers.”)

Any NEPA process should assess all applicable management direction relative to the intended Project as to the Star Lake Allotment, as well as ensure any authorization documents are in conformity with such management direction as per 43 C.F.R. § 1610.5-3(a) (10-1-2019 Edition). "
"DECI03","3 - BLM RMP Plans","DECI","Decision Process","In addition, as noted, MD RE 1 in the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA requires conformance to the buffers and RDFs even in General Habitat Management Areas, like those that would appear to be within the Star Lake Allotment. The “buffers” are identified in the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA at Appendix B. See Attachment #6 (which is attached hereto). While these “buffers” speak for themselves, it is apparent that the buffers implicate distances / buffers:

•	from roads (which must be 3.1 miles from leks),
•	from infrastructure related to energy development (which must be 2.0 miles from leks),
•	from tall structures (which must be 3.1 miles from leks),
•	from surface disturbance that involve altering or removing natural vegetation (which must be 3.1 miles from leks), and
 
•	noise and related disruptive activities that do not result in habitat loss (which must be at least 0.25 miles from leks).

See 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA at page B-1. These buffers would appear to reflect some significant challenges in the placement / location of the intended Wind Structures, depending on the location of active or occupied leks within the Star Lake Allotment. See Notice at PDF pages 5-6. The 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA, Appendix B, at page B-1, prescribes that:

[i]n determining lek locations, the BLM will use the most recent active or occupied lek data available from the state wildlife agency."
"DF01","1 - General","DF","Design Features","The “Required Design Features” or RFDs are identified in the 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA at Appendix C, Table C-1. The RFDs include, among others, the following:

General

1.	Solicit and consider expertise and ideas from local landowners, working groups, and other federal, state, county, and private organizations during development of projects.
2.	No repeated or sustained behavioral disturbance (e.g., visual, noise over 10 dbA at lek, etc.) to lekking birds from 6:00 pm to 9:00 am within 2 miles (3.2 km) of leks during the lekking season.
3.	Avoid mechanized anthropogenic disturbance, in nesting habitat during the nesting season when implementing: 1) fuels/vegetation/habitat restoration management projects, 2) infrastructure construction or maintenance, 3) geophysical exploration activities; 4) organized motorized recreational events.
4.	Avoid mechanized anthropogenic disturbance during the winter, in wintering areas when implementing: 1) fuels/vegetation/habitat restoration management projects, 2) infrastructure construction or maintenance, 3) geophysical exploration activities; 4) organized motorized recreational events.

2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA, Appendix C, at page C-2.

Lands and Realty

52.	Where technically and financially feasible, bury distribution powerlines and communication lines within existing disturbance.
53.	Above-ground disturbance areas would be seeded with perennial vegetation as per vegetation management.
 
54.	Place infrastructure in already disturbed locations where the habitat has not been fully restored.
55.	Cluster disturbances, operations (fracturing stimulation, liquids gathering, etc.) and facilities as close as possible.
56.	Co-locate linear facilities within one mile of existing linear facilities.
57.	Micro-site linear facilities to reduce impacts to sage-grouse habitats.
58.	Locate staging areas outside the Priority Habitat Management Areas to the extent possible.
59.	Consider colocating powerlines, flowlines and pipelines under or immediately adjacent to a road or adjacent to other pipelines first, before considering co- locating with other ROW.
60.	Restrict the construction of tall facilities and fences to the minimum number and amount needed.
61.	Use free standing structures where possible, to limit the use of guy wires. Where guy wires are necessary and appropriate bird collision diverters would be used, if doing so would not cause a human safety risk.
62.	Place new utility developments (power lines, pipelines, etc.) and transportation routes in existing utility or transportation corridors.
63.	Construction and development activities should conform to seasonal restrictions.

Roads

88.	Utilize existing roads, or realignments of existing routes to the extent possible.
89.	Design roads to an appropriate standard no higher than necessary to accommodate their intended purpose.
90.	Do not issue ROWs or SUAs to counties on newly constructed energy or mineral development roads, unless for a temporary use consistent with all other terms and conditions included in this document.
91.	Establish speed limits on BLM and FS system roads to reduce vehicle/wildlife collisions or design roads to be driven at slower speeds.
92.	Coordinate road construction and use among ROW or SUA holders.
93.	Construct road crossings at right angles to ephemeral drainages and stream crossings. 94. Use dust abatement on roads and pads.
95. Close and reclaim duplicate roads by restoring original landform and establishing desired vegetation.

"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","	Assuming a viable and feasible wind resource potential in the Star Lake Allotment, assuming the applicable Land Use Plan authorizes a Wind Project in the Star Lake Allotment, and assuming the applicant is capable of conforming to all applicable management direction in the Land Use Plan relative to any Wind Project in the Star Lake Allotment, the proposed project (through its construction, operation, and maintenance of its Wind Structures) will impact the Permittees’ annual authorized permitted use and Permittees’ annual authorized public land range improvements use, as well as maintenance, and will impact the Permittees’ overall livestock operations and local communites.

The Notice requested comments on “site-specific issues on how the proposed project may impact your grazing operations”; adding that BLM will then “explore possible alternatives or mitigation strategies that could be incorporated into a plan of development for the project” which “could include on-the-ground grazing mitigation, such as grazing practices, seasonal movements, range improvements (e.g., moving fences, water distribution), rerouting access, etc”.

Beyond what is already stated above, the Permittee proffer the following “site-specific issues on how the proposed project” may/will impact our grazing operations:

 
(a)	Suggested Affected Environment, according to Notice.

The Notice forecasts at PDF page 7 “Disturbance Acres” during the construction phase and during the operational phase as to each of the Wind Structures within the Star Lake Allotment, as follows:

As previously stated, the Permittees contends that the actual disturbance acres, as well as the actual zone of impact acres, will be significantly larger, impacting the entire landscape of the Star Lake Allotment given the riddling of Wind Structures across the Star Lake Allotment as illustrated on the Map in page 3 of this letter. This contention is based upon the following comments below.

(b)	Affected Environment as to Livestock – Star Lake Allotment.

The public lands within Star Lake Allotment are within a designated Grazing District established under the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. § 315, and are available / allocated for livestock grazing by the applicable Land Use Plan as per the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, 43 U.S.C. § 1712, see also 43 C.F.R. 4100.0-8 (10-1-2005 Edition). Based upon such designation and allocation, the Permittees separately own base property (in the form of private land) upon which Grazing Preferences and Permitted Use AUMs within the Star Lake
 
Allotment are attached and through which BLM has issued and renewed Grazing Permits to the Permittees overtime within the Star Lake Allotment.

The existing Permitted Use AUMs in the Star Lake Allotment are noted in Attachment #2 and are subject to (indefinite) renewal as long as the Permittees remain in substantial compliance with the grazing regulations and the terms in their respective Grazing Permits, and as along as the public lands remain allocated to livestock grazing. 43 C.F.R. §§ 4110.1(b)(1), 4130.2(d) (10- 1-2005 Edition). The total Permitted Use AUMs equates to 24,940 AUMs, of which 17,770 AUMs are Active Use AUMs, and 7,170 AUMs is Suspended Use AUMs. The Permittees account for 15,660 AUMs of the total Permitted Use AUMs, of which 11,285 AUMs are Active Use AUMs, and 4,375 AUMs are Suspended Use AUMs. See Attachment Nos. 1 and 2.

The Star Lake Allotment is inclusive for 98,139.01 acres according to BLM, and is divided / separated by fence into 15 separate pastures. The Permitted Use AUMs are annually rotated through these pastures generally between April 1 and September 30, and between November 1 and December 31, by cattle (in the form of cows and calves) and by sheep (ewes and lamb). The grazing rotation is coordinated with BLM to maintain and enhance the native species status and the seeded species status, as well as conform to other applicable resource objectives and rangeland health standards. The principle, adverse impact to these species has been wildfire due, in part, to the excessive fuel loading that exists in the Star Lake Allotment.

The Permitted Use AUMs in the Star Lake Allotment is subject to change as per 43
C.F.R. §§ 4110.3, 4110.3-3(b) (10-1-2005), and as per the applications submitted by the Permittees on May 8, 2009, to activate their respective Suspended Use AUMs in accordance with 43 C.F.R. § 4110.3-1(b) (10-1-2005 Edition). These applications have been pending and not yet processed due to apparent other priorities by BLM. However, it would seem that if BLM is now going to take the time to assess the public lands within the Star Lake Allotment for an apparent “anthropogenic disturbance” purpose,2 such as “wind turbines”, BLM should also assess the public lands within the Star Lake Allotment for a non-anthropogenic disturbance purpose, such as to activate the Permittees’ Suspended Use AUMs (assuming compatibility, as discussed herein).

The Permitted Use AUMs in the Star Lake Allotment is supported by a number of public land range improvements, including seedings, fences, and water developments. A list of these range improvements is available in the records and files of BLM. The Permittees hold an interest in these temporary and permanent range improvements.

The law prescribes that should the public lands be “disposed of or devoted to a public purpose which precludes livestock grazing”, the Permittees are entitled to “reasonable compensation for, but not to exceed the fair market value of his or her interest in authorized permanent range improvements located on these public lands”. 43 C.F.R. § 4110.4-2(b) (10-1-

2 The 2015 Idaho ROD-ARMPA at page 5-1 defines “Anthropogenic disturbances”, as “Human- created features that include paved highways, graded gravel roads, transmission lines, substations, wind turbines, oil and gas wells, geothermal wells and associated facilities, pipelines, landfills, agricultural conversion, homes, and mines.” Emphasis supplied.
 
2005 Edition); see 43 C.F.R. § 4120.3-6(c) (10-1-2005 Edition); see also 43 C.F.R. §§ 4120.3- 3(c), 4120.3-5 (10-1-2005 Edition); see also 43 U.S.C. § 315q (wherein it is stated that “[w]henever use for war or national defense purposes of the public domain or other property owned by or under the control of the United States prevents its use for grazing, persons holding grazing permits …. and persons whose grazing permits … have been or will be canceled because of such use shall be paid out of the funds appropriated or allocated for such project such amounts as the head of the department or agency so using the lands shall determine to be fair and reasonable for the losses suffered by such persons as a result of the use of such lands for war or national defense purposes.”)."
"SOC04","4 - Employment","SOC","Socioeconomics","Related thereto, the Permittees and their employees represent local people, who live and work in the local communities. The intended Project would appear to employ people that would not be from the local communities due to the seemingly specialized skills that would be involved during the (short-term) construction phase and during (long-term) operational / maintenance phase. In addition, it would seem that these specialized skill people would not live in Jerome or Lincoln Counties, but in Twin Falls County. Assuming this is the reality, the Permittees question the “benefit” to the local communities by the intended Project at least the “employee” matter."
"FIRE01","1 - General","FIRE","Fire and Fuels Management","Independent of the impacts to the public land range improvements, what will happen to wildfire suppression during the construction phase (and after the construction phase)? Permittees and their families are all active in the Rural Fire Protection Association or RFPA and spend time each summer fighting wildfire on, among others, the Star Lake Allotment to protect the forage and related public land (and private land) resources.

Is the applicant going to pay for wildfire suppression (either permanently or
temporarily)?

Permittees need answers on how wildfire suppression would work in and around the intended
project. We assume that Magic Valley Energy would not want their windmills slathered with red
fire retardant. We would also assume that any air tanker would not want to go near an 800-foot
whirling turbine blade. Many times, the difference between success and failure in wildfire
situations is the availability and use of air tankers. As such, this implicates the likelihood of
larger wildfires in the future within the Star Lake Allotment due to inefficient or ineffective
future wildfire suppression. More wildfire and/or larger fires will result in the Permittees facing
more temporary reductions in grazing use due to lack of efficient / effective wildfire suppression
tactics, like air tankers. How will that be addressed? Is the applicant going to pay for the
temporary loss of AUMs due to future wildfire?"
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","(d)	Impacts to livestock operations after construction phase, but during operation phase & maintenance phase of the intended Wind Project.

See (c) above, which is incorporated herein.

The intended project creates 926 acres of separate Wind Structures on the Star Lake Allotment, and implicates the construction of 350 miles of new roads across the entire project area; easing the access by the applicant and resulting in much higher speed of travel and much more traffic. This endangers livestock and wildlife especially at night. Is the applicant going to pay for the loss of livestock injured or killed by motor vehicles?

Permittees are informed that each wind turbine will emit sound approximately equivalent to a running lawn mower. Spaced at quarter mile increments there will be a constant drone. How does this affect livestock distribution within the Star Lake Allotment? What effect will increased electromagnetic fields have on livestock and wildlife health and reproduction? Permittees are informed that wind farms reduce precipitation and raise ground temperatures in the immediate area of the project. Is that true?
Would that be true on the Star Lake Allotment as to its micro-environment? If yes, how will that be mitigated since that will directly, adversely impact the forage growth on the allotment? It has been found that cattle often cluster around wind turbines (e.g. for shade) where wind energy projects are located in grazing allotments. 2005 FPEIS-Wind, Volume 1, at page 5-57. How will that be mitigated, including any resulting disturbed areas? Permittees are concerned that any disturbed areas would/could likely impact achievement of applicable rangeland health standards.
"
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","Assuming the intended project is authorized, what will happen when the useful life of the project ends or the economics result in the need to abandon the project? What is the plan for decommissioning? And, assuming the intended project results in defacto disposing of or devoting (in whole or in part) the public lands in the Star Lake Allotment to wind energy development, what is plan upon recommissioning? Will the existing Permittees (or their successors or assigns) continue to hold the
 
existing Grazing Preferences and Permitted Use AUMs so to be first-in-line for the allocation of the forage within the Star Lake Allotment in the future?

It has been suggested to the Permittees that any permanent loss of AUMs will be minimal. This suggestion seems without foundation. "
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","Permittees have taken great care to develop and protect the public land resources through rotational management, seedings, fencing, and water development so as to conform to land use plan objectives and rangeland health standards. As explained herein, this intended project will have devastating impacts to this development and protection without any clear answers / direction on how our investment will be maintained and enhanced or otherwise mitigated. Site excavation, heavy equipment mobilization, and blasting, and 350 miles of roadbuilding through all seasons will no doubt take a heavy toll. Cranes and heavy equipment will traverse the site with no regard for fences, pipelines, or buried wire. The forage resource will be damaged for years come, while the claim is that there will not be much land disturbance. The fact is that when working in all seasons, we all know when one route becomes impassable another will quickly be established. These ecosystems are fragile and disturbance leads to propagation of invasive species and noxious weeds.

"ALT01","1 - General Deficiency, Inadequate Range of Alts","ALT","Alternatives","Based on these issues, the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should develop a wide range of alternatives that meaningfully avoid, minimize and mitigate negative effects. Such alternatives could seek to reduce visual effects by dropping turbine strings within a certain distance of Minidoka National Historic Site and lowering the hub height of the next set of towers, among other measures. We recommend working with stakeholders to see how they respond to different alternatives designed to address the issues of concern. "
"AIR03","3 - Climate Change/GHG","AIR","Air Quality","The Council for Environmental Quality is in the process of revising the NEPA regulations so that federal agencies must analyze the climate effects of projects on federal land. While this revision process has not been finalized, we recommend that the BLM include a climate assessment as part of this project."
"DECI03","3 - BLM RMP Plans","DECI","Decision Process","The BLM’s 1986 Monument Resource Management Plan is one of the oldest and most outdated plans in the nation. While there have been some issue specific amendments regarding Sage-grouse, there is an overall lack of direction and insufficient consideration of modern natural resource issues such as wildfires, noxious weeds, sensitive species, water quality, water quantity, habitat fragmentation, recreation, rural economics, livestock management, cultural protections, climate change, light pollution, among others. The outdated nature of the Resource Management Plan places a higher burden on the NEPA analysis to carefully consider the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives. Where the Monument does provide some management direction for cultural resources, we have highlighted those sections in later sections of our comments. We also believe that there is a need for the BLM to provide additional amendments to Resource Management Plans following the analysis of this project in order to address concerns raised through this process. "
"ALT01","1 - General Deficiency, Inadequate Range of Alts","ALT","Alternatives","Analyzing a reasonable range of alternatives is the heart of the NEPA process. Developing this range begins with an appropriately drafted purpose and need statement. As we explained above, the BLM should consider the purpose and need for the Lava Ridge project to include a range of alternative renewable energy technologies and project designs. The Plan of Development describes that the project could include a larger number of smaller individual turbines or a smaller number of larger turbines. The BLM should examine both alternatives as well as other renewable technologies that would produce similar amounts of energy for similar costs. Ultimately, the BLM may select a combination from different alternatives, providing that the NEPA analysis sufficiently covers the impacts. 
"
"ALT02","2 - Suggested New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","The Plan of Development proposes a two year development period and two year construction time frame. This phased approach enables an alternative that allows for development in areas with the lowest conflicts while continuing to optimize options in other areas. This approach could defer  the “front-country” development in a larger swath around Minidoka National Historic Site for a number of years. During this time Magic Valley Energy/LS Power and BLM can conduct an ongoing assessment of the rapidly changing market conditions and technological improvements happening in the industry to shape future project phases. A significant update to the Plan of Development could require a separate NEPA process. However, by creating a sufficiently broad purpose and need and range of alternatives at this stage the BLM can enable future proposals to tier from this analysis.
"
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","We are particularly concerned about potential impacts to the Minidoka National Historic Site, located northeast of Twin Falls, Idaho. Minidoka was one of the isolated internment sites that held unjustly relocated and incarcerated Japanese Americans during World War II. Over 13,000 Japanese Americans were imprisoned at the site.  Today, the National Park Service maintains the former camp as a memorial to those Americans of Japanese ancestry who were wrongfully incarcerated at the camp and as a reminder to our citizens of the injustice forced on so many through racial profiling, fear, and hatred.

The visual impacts of the proposed Lava Ridge project to the Minidoka National Historic Site are likely significant, and may alter the nature and feeling visitors derive from the stark and isolated location.  Retaining the open vistas allows visitors to “better understand and connect to the daily lives at Minidoka,” (Minidoka Foundation Document). In discussions with Friends of Minidoka, ICL staff learned about the importance of maintaining the feeling of isolation through Minidoka’s viewshed. This community hosts annual pilgrimages to the historic site to pay homage to survivors and descendants of incarcerees. For many, maintaining the integrity of Minidoka is necessary to continue the remembrance of this civil rights violation and the resilience of the Japanese American community.

The proposed Plan of Development includes wind turbines within just two miles of the Site and many within the original footprint of the 33,000 acre internment camp.  At heights over 700 feet tall, these imposing structures, and associated electric lines, could dominate the viewshed for miles.  This infrastructure could impact Minidoka visitors as they approach the site and attempt to experience the forced isolation that is part of the historical relevance of the site.
The BLM should consider a range of alternatives that would avoid, minimize, and mitigate the impact to the Minidoka site."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The BLM guidance on estimating nonmarket environmental values and analyzing those values in NEPA analysis was designated by IM 2013-131.  This guidance directed the BLM to “utilize estimates of non-market environmental values in NEPA analysis supporting planning and other decision-making.” Nonmarket values are described as values that “reflect the benefits individuals attribute to experiences of the environment, uses of natural resources, or the existence of particular ecological conditions that do not involve market transactions and therefore lack prices.” We believe that these non-market values are important for understanding socio-cultural impacts, such as those associated with the Minidoka National Historic Site. A social preference survey would help the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power better understand the scope of the issue and the range of potential impacts to the historic site. We recommend the BLM conduct a social preference survey of a broad range of Japanese Americans on how project components in different alternatives would affect their individual experience and the integrity of Minidoka National Historic Site. See Martín-López et al. 2012 for an example of a social preference survey methodology. "
"DECI11","11 - State or Local Permits","DECI","Decision Process","Other venues for the protection of the Minidoka National Historic Site outside of the BLM permitting process would be a review of county planning and zoning regulations and discussions with planning and zoning staff and county commissioners of Jerome, Minidoka and Lincoln counties. In other areas, scenic easement agreements have successfully been used with willing private landowners to keep rural landscapes in production while protecting these areas from inappropriate forms of development. 
"
"CUL02","2 - General Native American Concerns","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","We also recommend that the BLM examine how not just climate change but societal adaptations to climate change - such as this project - are affecting Native American communities: 

Increasing indigenous participation in climate-change initiatives is one potential solution for increasing the resilience of indigenous communities. Indigenous perspectives and traditional knowledges must guide climate-change assessment and adaptation to develop culturally appropriate strategies.  
"
"VIS02","2 - Night Sky / Dark Sky","VIS","Visual Resources","Not only can the view of wind turbines during the day impact the visual and scenic quality of an area, but the flashing red lights for aviation can impact night skies as well. ICL supports the use of radar detection systems such as aircraft detection lighting systems to mitigate any need for continuous operation of night time red lights. If light pollution is an issue, there are a number of Dark Sky related measures that could be adopted in the larger area to serve as an offset and potentially result in a net decrease in light pollution. Craters of the Moon is already a designated Dark Sky Park,  but light pollution from other areas is marring night sky observations. Light pollution prevention measures could be considered by surrounding communities. A Dark Sky designation may even be tailored to fit the community’s circumstances and wishes. 

We recognize the interest in accelerating project completion and understand that mobile light plants may be employed to allow for construction at nighttime. We recommend employing both light and noise pollution measures during nighttime construction activities and considering seasonal restrictions as needed to reduce impacts to wildlife. "

Upon completion, the Plan of Development estimates only twenty on-site employees will be necessary to run the wind facility. If largely unplanned, the difference between short-term peak construction workforce and long-term operations and maintenance workforce could have a boom and bust on the local social and economic systems in these communities. Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should work with the local municipalities to ensure that traffic, housing, food systems, and other local infrastructure will not suffer from a boom and bust associated with a short-term influx and exit of the construction workforce in the area.

"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","Avoiding human footprint at a 3.1 mile radius from leks is an important first step in protecting sage-grouse populations, but sage-grouse could be engaged in nesting and brood-rearing, in addition to lekking, for much of the planned construction activity period.  Recent studies have shown that only 64% of nesting sites occur within 3.1 miles of leks, but 80% of nests are found within five miles, and 20% of nests occur at distances greater than five miles from leks.  Nest success is also greater the farther a nest occurs from a lek, indicating a disproportionate potential importance of these more important nests for population recruitment. 

Based on the habitat guidelines for sage-grouse management presented in Connelly et al. (2000),  and others, we recommend siting infrastructure far enough from leks and other sage-grouse habitat to avoid negative effects. Aldridge and Boyce (2007) and Doherty et al. (2010) identify a buffer of 6.2 miles to protect important nesting and brood-rearing habitats. Depending on how sage-grouse are utilizing the project area, the BLM should consider placing a similar sized buffer around the largest of the three sage-grouse leks in one of the alternatives. 

The BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should also consider how construction and operations may be affected should the USFWS decide to protect Sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act during the life of this project. A more protective buffer at the start of the project may allow the project to proceed with more certainty rather than have construction or operations curtailed at some later date due to a listing decision and insufficient buffers within the project area.

"WILD02","2 - Big Game ","WILD","General Wildlife","Pronghorn, mule deer and elk utilize the project area, particularly during winter months. See attached report, Figure 2 (Attachment 2). A population study of mule deer and pronghorn in Blaine County - and unrelated to any Lava Ridge studies - revealed a previously unknown migration path through the Lava Ridge project site. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game is calling this apparent route the “Owinza Pronghorn Migration.” Because only a handful of animals were collared for this unrelated study, the preliminary findings are insufficient for the purposes of taking a hard look at the potential impacts of this project. Only seven pronghorn were monitored and too few mule deer were collared for statistically significant mapping.  The Idaho Department of Fish and Game hopes to conduct a more comprehensive study in the Lava Ridge area to get a better understanding of how big game utilize this area. We recommend that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power coordinate with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to make sure a sufficient number of individuals of each species is collared this winter. 

It is unclear as of scoping what kind of separate quantitative studies Magic Valley Energy/LS Power has conducted. We recommend that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power provide meaningful assistance to the upcoming Fish and Game study as their project depends on having high quality data from which to make informed decisions. The study should be conducted throughout this winter and continue into the next winter to gain a better understanding of how big game utilize this area. It is not sufficient to simply collect data within the project area. For effective off-site mitigation measures, it is important to understand the population dynamics, core habitat areas, migratory corridors and limiting factors in the surrounding area so that off-site mitigation measures can be tailored to the identified limiting factors.

"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","Insects have been found to have fatal interactions with wind turbines, often facing fatal collisions with turbine blades. While there are few studies that have been able to determine the exact impact of this energy infrastructure on pollinating insects, it appears that swarming and migrating arthropods are often killed by turbines.  Declines in insect populations can lead to a significant decline in the ecosystem services provided by these species, especially pollination services. We recommend that BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power survey the local pollinator species and determine their risk of decline from the construction of Lava Ridge. Especially with agriculture as the dominant land use, maintenance of healthy pollinator populations is important for the environmental and economic health of the area. There are a number of mitigation measures that can be undertaken to improve pollinator habitat and pollinators in the broader area and we encourage Magic Valley Energy/LS Power to explore these options. We note that simply improving habitat for pollinators or other types of wildlife within the project area may not be the best mitigation measure if these species may be harmed by turbine operations. "

Artificially elevated raven populations can have adverse impacts on sage-grouse eggs, nestlings or other sensitive species. Transmission lines have been associated with dramatic increases in raven nesting and landfills and road-killed animals serve as food subsidies for these birds. Avoiding new infrastructure in sensitive wildlife habitat is of critical importance. Designing energy infrastructure to reduce the ability for ravens to nest or perch on structures is also important. There are also ways to mitigate for elevated raven populations by removing the subsidies. Actions may include relocating or redesigning landfills and transfer stations, removing types of infrastructure that are no longer needed such as old fence lines, working with the BLM and permittees to support the swift burial or removal of dead livestock, and working with ITD, Fish and Game and the County Road Maintenance crews on timely removal of trash and roadkill.

The monitoring and evaluation plan should include objectives for wildlife and habitat health, a schedule for monitoring and reporting, parameters to measure whether the impacts are within the range of the environmental analysis. We also recommend developing population and habitat triggers for key wildlife species and a set of predetermined actions if triggers are tripped.

There are several buttes in Jerome County that provide ideal localities for the placement of radio and other kinds of signal towers. The most predominant example would be the butte located east of the Jerome County Airport where several towers are currently in operation. Rarely are the physical attributes of these buttes conducive to other operational activities. Even vegetative crops are intermittent on these buttes, their presence typically determined by the amount of rocky terrain and lack of irrigation water located at each particular butte. For these reasons, signal towers should be allowed on the County’s buttes free of any zoning restrictions unless located in or near airport overlay zones. Such towers may be appropriately placed in other locations as well, but their placement in these other areas may require a permitting process so as to ensure the towers do not conflict with other uses in the region. Alternative energy sources, such as wind or solar power, may be appropriate but should also require a permitting process to prevent or mitigate potential conflicts.

It will make it hard to experience that same sense of remoteness and isolation experienced by Japanese Americans during World War II.   

LS Powers proposal would dishonor our nations acknowledgment that the incarceration of Japanese Americans was wrong. It will destroy Minidokas ability to commemorate our parents and grandparents and serve as a place of healing and learning and it will desecrate sacred ground.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","By law, the National Park Service is required to manage the parks fundamental resources and values unimpaired for future generations. As stated in the Parks Foundation Document, these values include:   

*	Environmental Setting: Minidokas remote location in the high desert of Idaho provides an immersive setting that is fundamental to the visitor experience. Views of open fields and distant mountains create a sense of isolation on a vast landscape where Minidoka once stoodExtreme changes in temperature, the arid environment, and high winds that the people at Minidoka experienced are part of the environmental setting that are felt today. Experiencing this environmental setting allows visitors to better understand and connect to the daily lives at Minidoka.
*	Commemoration and Healing: Minidoka provides a place  for engagement, reflection, and healing. These sites provoke connections to individuals affected by the World War II exclusion, forced removal, and unjust incarceration, and serves to commemorate those who survived this difficult chapter of American history. 
*	Public Understanding, Education, and Involvement: Educating and engaging the public in understanding the history of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, the fragile nature of civil rights, and the need to protect civil and constitutional rights in the United States is essential...At Minidoka, special events such as the pilgrimage and the civil liberties symposium connect the public to the history that occurred here and its significance today.

LS Power, a New York private equity firm, is seeking BLM approval to build 400 wind towers as high as 740 feet tall just north of Minidoka, with several towers located on the historic footprint of the camp.  

Approximately 340 towers will be visible from the park on a clear day.   They will form a visual wall of towers that will dominate about one-third of the parks 360-degree viewshed.  Each of the towers could be taller than the Space Needle (604 feet).  With turbine blades the length of the wingspan of a Boeing 747, each of the 340 towers visible from the park will create a visual impact equivalent to a 747 wing rotating on the Space Needle.

There will be increased, pressure on schools, law enforcement, emergency services, housing, labor and more. Reliable studies of these issues should be examined. The surge during construction will create a boom which can only be followed by local recession. The product of this project will be high-cost electricity that benefits no one in Idaho and, while not being governed by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, may ultimately find its way in to the cost of the citizens power rates causing their power bills to rise. Idaho Power that serves most of this part of Idaho says they don’t need or want the power.

Idahoans should listen to Idaho Power and not take the bait. Social and economic conditions will be tipped on its head

Add 380 miles of roads and whining spinning wind mills and the area will be overrun with recreation and livestock alike the loser. Vandalism of all kinds, with cattle and sheep being harassed and even being shot will surely be the result. Any attempt to lock up this vast road and substation network will certainly anger the population and increase vandalism, after it is too late. There has to be hundreds of miles of connecting power lines either over head or buried. It is hard to imagine the effects of all that construction and operation.

Fox, Skunks, Badgers, Coyotes, Bobcats, Cottontail and Jack Rabbits are all on the decline and need enhanced habitat to recover. Birds of prey are of particular concern, there used to be many more Hawks of many types. Turbines, some over 700 ft high, have adverse effects on birds that is well documented. Golden and occasionally bald eagles are here every fall and winter. Owls need help not reduced habit. There are Huns and used to be Chucker.  There are still some Pheasants, and Morning Doves. Mule Deer use the area as a migratory route south in the winter. Antelope and Deer used to be more abundant. Many have their young in the desert crags. The harassment and loss of habitat will drive them out or finish them off. All of the species are supported by the farms but they need the desert for refuge to survive and thrive. There are migratory birds, such as Canadian Geese, Snow Geese, Swans, Pelicans, many Duck species, and even Trumper Swans here in the winter and spring. All the species will be adversely affected if not killed by this project. There are Swallows, Sparrows, Robins, Raven, Crows, and many more. The effects of that many roads and increased traffic alone, will finish them off."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The Lava Ridge Wind Project will significantly and negatively impact the Minidoka National Historical Site. As you are likely already well aware, this national park and historical monument acknowledges the injustice of U.S. Government actions against Japanese Americans in World War II. Minidoka serves several essential purposes for the Japanese American community-- namely it is a place for commemoration and healing. People, like my dear friend whose grandfather was interned at Minidoka, make pilgrimages here in an effort to feel a connection to their ancestors' experiences. 


Additionally, Minidoka ensures that for those not directly impacted by the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII there are resources to acknowledge and understand this painful part of our shared history. Minidoka provides educational resources and an immersive experience in just how isolating it was to be forced to live there.


All of this-- the immersive experience, the educational opportunities, and the space to connect and heal, are at risk due to the Lava Ridge Wind Project. Based on its plans, these wind turbines will dramatically alter the environment surrounding Minidoka. It will make it hard to experience the sense of isolation and remoteness needed for true healing, learning, and commemoration. The approximately 340 towers would alter the environment, skyline, and surrounding traffic-- creating a visual impact that would change this sacred space forever.


When I spoke to my friend about her incredibly formative but painful visit to Minidoka she spoke at length about the visceral feeling the landscape provided her, bringing her closer to her grandfather's experience. In most cases, all that we have to remind us of our nation's painful history are monuments designed to convey the lived experience of those forced to endure it. It is essential that we preserve that experience for visitors to Minidoka and that can only be done if the Lava Ridge Wind Project is stopped.

I am 100% opposed to this windmill turbine project. Giving up 7,300 acres of Idaho property to a New York based company is not right. Once it is gone it is gone forever, lost, destroyed and with it goes wild life, land scape, animals, people, this property is part of us. It is ours not to give away to some out of state company that has no regard or respect for us. If this is such a great project then put it in California or Nevada. I consider this project request an insult. ""Let's put this ugly land scape mess in Idaho. I am sure they are stupid enough to let us do it, we don't want it in our state"". I am sure this has been stated.

Besides an eye sore mechanical menace, what else are we going to receive from it? Nothing!! Not a single thing. We lose 73,000 acres and turn over that much land to be controlled by a New York company along with all the right of way for our power lines, sub stations and whatever else they deem necessary. No please do not approve this project. I moved to Idaho 25 years ago to escape this kind of stuff and give thanks every day that I live here. As far as I am concerned Idaho is a great place to live and I want it to stay that way. I reside in the county area of Buhl, our neighbor grows corn around our property. They just completed the green chop and asked if we were happy the corn is gone. My reply; I would rather watch corn grow than look out at a dozen houses full of city people.

Sage Grouse are listed as 'Threatened' under the Endangered Species Act, and actually listed as 'Endangered' by the IUCN Red List. 


The project should avoid disturbing ""Important Habitat Management Area"" (IHMA) and ""General Habitat Management Area"" (GHMA) as much as possible.


So, no turbines, access roads, or power lines or other supporting infrastructure should be located in Sage Grouse 'Priority Habitat Management Areas' (PHMA). 
>>>And NONE of these items should be located within four miles of Sage Grouse Leks.


Where possible, power lines in Grouse habitat should be installed underground. (Some exceptions may be necessary where it is difficult to underground in lava rock.)

According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) this region has Important Conservation Areas and is an Occupied Range for Greater Sage Grouse in Idaho. 
In thier website (www.fws.gov/greatersagegrouse/factsheets/IdahoGrSGFactSheet_FINAL%20(1).pdf) it is stated :


""Located at the northern edge of the Great Basin, Idaho has a cluster of priority habitat areas in the central part of the state that functions as a hub for genetic connectivity between the eastern and western portion of the species range.""

Within BLM's own planning document called ""A Framework to Identify Greater Sage-grouse Preliminary Priority Habitat and Preliminary General Habitat for Idaho"" there is a map that shows this region to be a primary Sage Grouse Management Area and below is another one of the maps copied from the website of the primary Lek Locations, specifically in the region of the Lava Ridge project.

----------------
Also, please pay attention to the fact that the ""1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act"" must be adhered to. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule, under the Biden Administration, restores protections under this bedrock environmental law, which prohibits the take of migratory bird species  (regulatory-speak for hunting, killing, capturing, selling or otherwise hurting them). 
Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the restored interpretation of the rule would protect more birds threatened by the dual crises of climate change and habitat loss. We don't want the Lava Ridge project to promote habitat loss.

BUT, having said all the above, we desperately need the power from Wind in this critical age when Climate Change is threatening our planet. So we ask that care be taken to respect the threats to Sage Grouse, while providing important power for our region at the same time.

Both of these uses are common for bats on the Snake River Plain. Year-round acoustic monitoring may be necessary to identify particularly cryptic species like big brown bats and to detect migration pulses. "

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","On behalf of the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experiences, I am writing to provide public comment on the proposed Lava Ridge Wind Project, which will have significant impacts on the Minidoka National Historic Site.  

 

Around 2002, the Wing Luke Museum met with over 50 individuals who were formerly incarcerated at the Minidoka concentration camp during World War II over a series of 9 meetings to find out from them as a group what they desired at the Minidoka National Historic Site. We then provided comments on the General Management Plan for the site at that time (the page references below refer a draft version at that time). Their comments then speak powerfully now into considerations for what should happen to the environs and conditions at the site (at that time referred to as the Minidoka National Historic Monument): 

 

The unfertile barrenness and desolation of the historic period of the Minidoka concentration camp has changed dramatically to the present-day irrigated agricultural landscape. Former internees who have visited the site repeatedly mention that it is nearly unrecognizable  the muddy ground and storms of dust that they endured at Minidoka have been replaced by thriving green farmland (notably a change that came from the work of their own hands). The NPS has the difficult job of maintaining the wide views and open environment of Minidoka  perhaps best done by maintaining the agricultural environment (which also provides further interpretation opportunities)  while also creating ways for visitors to experience Minidoka as former internees most vividly remember it  as the dusty, barren, formidable, inhospitable environment it was. Balance between these two conditions must be given throughout the GMP/EIS, and efforts must be given at Minidoka Internment National Monument to share with visitors both aspects of the environment. Comments within the GMP/EIS on page 125 noting that for former internees, the area is often unrecognizable, as they associated the camp landscape more with desolation and barrenness than rolling green fields rightfully remind us that the current camp landscape can be deceptive from the actual environment faced by internees. The plan stated for Alternative B (page 163) and Alternative C (page 176) for selective restoration [to] highlight the open, stark, barren landscape first encountered by the internees is critical for the site and should also be included in Alternative D. Moreover, this selective restoration should also be mentioned in the Summary on page x, which currently only mentions protection of vegetation. Also, in the Education and Interpretation section of Planning Issues and Concerns (page 57), as the GMP/EIS makes mention of the challenge for the NPS to enable visitors to understand and appreciate the size of the original site, it should also make mention of the challenge to enable visitors to understand and appreciate the original and historically accurate environmental conditions endured by the internees.  excerpted from comments submitted in 2005 




I put in bold comments from the former incarcerees that relate to the proposed Wind Project. They specifically call for the maintenance of the wide views and open environment of Minidoka and the selective restoration [to] highlight the open, stark, barren landscape first encountered by the internees [sic]. From these comments, we see that it is both the land within the physical boundary of the site as well as the views beyond it that are of critical importance to the visitor experience, educational interpretation and historic preservation of the site. 

 

It is imperative that we listen to, elevate and honor the perspectives and desires of those most impacted by the World War II incarceration experience  the former incarcerees themselves. These comments speak directly to their desires at the site and speak strongly into the harmful impacts that the Wind Project would have, dishonoring their voices and experiences yet again and reflecting a failure to restore justice, degrading the work that so many have fought so hard to build for so many years. 

 

We call you to make a commitment to their original vision  to expand the boundaries of the Minidoka National Historic Site rather than encroach upon it, to restore the environs and conditions to the open, stark, barren landscape that it once was, and to heighten interpretation to extend to the views beyond (whether through actual land or virtual media or a combination of both). 

 

The mission of the Wing Luke Museum is to connect everyone to the rich history, dynamic cultures and art of Asian Pacific Americans through vivid storytelling and inspiring experiences. The Wing Luke Museum is the only pan-Asian Pacific American museum in the nation, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution and an Affiliated Area of the National Park Service. We are nationally recognized for our community process, rooted in stewarding long-term relationships with community members, and deeply involved in connecting the past to the present with a vision towards the future. As such, we feel tremendous responsibility to carry forth the vision and perspectives of our community members, even when they have passed on. Indeed, in this case, we are fortunate to have their captured their perspectives on this present situation and are called all the more to carry them out. "
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","I am submitting this letter as a descendant of a family imprisoned in an American Concentration Camp called Minidoka in southeast Idaho. As someone who has often visited the Minidoka National Historic Site, I am appalled at the thought of the Lava Ridge Wind Farm Project proposal.

 

As one of the organizers of the Minidoka pilgrimage, I am familiar with the site and know the strong connection it has to my family and community.  Unlike what happened almost 80 years ago, the community and survivors come back on their own terms. They pass on the stories of the prison camp where they were unjustly forced to live because of fear and race prejudice. The land holds sacred value and should be preserved as an educational resource without the harm that would be brought by the wind project proposal. 

 

Since its designation as a National Monument in 2001, the Minidoka National Historic Site has attracted countless visitors to learn and experience the history of racial oppression that it represents. With the support of the National Park Service, Friends of Minidoka and the Minidoka Pilgrimage Planning Committee, the site has become a living history. To fully experience the site and recognize the pain, only the sounds of birds and nature should be heard among the tears.

 

The additional noise of the wind project will not benefit the site or the experience. The visual of the towers spotted in the distance will not enhance anyones experience or help them understand what it was like to be an American in an American Concentration camp in WWII.  It would be a travesty to lose this important aspect of American history.  I ask that the Bureau of Land Management consider the detrimental impact of this project on the surrounding area and do not move forward with this proposal.  There should be a thorough review and assessment on the impacts to resources and further comments should be allowed in virtual/online settings to accommodate the many survivors of Minidoka that are present throughout the world.

It was a way to talk about our own family trauma while connecting with a community of people who have similar histories. While incarceration at Minidoka was an event of the past, it is still a trauma we are unpacking.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Over the past ten years, I have had the privilege of attending the annual Minidoka National Historic Site Pilgrimage many times. As a white American who grew up just after World War II, these experiences have been invaluable to my understanding of American, and especially Pacific Northwest history and culture. What a treasure to all of us to have a living museum that captures and honors the real-life stories of unjustly incarcerated Japanese Americans, as well as the generational impact of the incarceration their families and communities. I am asking you to please prioritize protecting this history for all of us.

One of the most powerful and educational experiences of being on the grounds of Minidoka is experiencing the isolation of the site. The expansive and desolate landscape brings home the reality of how far away these families were from everything they knew and how much resilience it took for them to survive such a horrifying ordeal. Please don’t erase this history by erasing the landscape that played such a huge part in the experiences of those incarcerated.

I am deeply concerned that by surrounding this sacred site with huge wind towers, along with all of foot traffic that goes with them, that Minidoka will be reduced to an entertainment park, when in fact it needs to be held as a revered monument to the lessons that we must learn as a country. Not only do we owe it to those incarcerated and their families to maintain this site as it has always stood, but we owe it to all of us to protect this site as the national museum that it is.

Please protect the Minidoka National Historic Park and find an alternate location for the Lava Ridge Wind Project. Please protect this most precious of national monuments for all the generations to come who deserve to fully experience and understand this critical part of United States history."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","I have been to the Minidoka area two times with a contingent of Japanese Americans from Seattle. The isolation, quiet and desolation are all very moving. Having a huge wind farm close by would ruin it for those trying to understand what their relatives dealt with while incarcerated there. Surely the wind farm could be moved farther away from Minidoka so that the peace and tranquility are not destroyed.
The government chose very isolated areas to intern the Japanese Americans who then lived in abysmal circumstances.
  It is vitally important to preserve areas of our history whether they are positive or negative. Minidoka is an example along with all the other internment camps of a very negative experience for the Japanese American people forced to live there. I don't think it's too much to ask to preserve the sanctity of that area so that those wishing to visit it aren't distracted by a large wind farm.
 The Japanese Americans lost everything when they were interned; their homes, their pets, their cars, their belongings, their money, their jobs, their dreams and their dignity. It seems like a slap in the face for a corporate entity to desecrate an area that they hold important if only for historical perspective.

Not only are those wind towers a sore sight that will ruin our beautiful landscape but they are not green, they are not renewable and they do nothing belong here! These big wind turbines take a huge amount of fossil fuel to make, transport to America snd then transport again across America. They kill an immeasurable amount of birds and bats. This area for the proposed wind farm is not only sacred to Japanese Americans but also to Native Americans. 

These ugly wind turbines are so terrible for the environment that countries like Europe and Japan are outlawing them. They have realized the dangers and destruction these turbines cause far outweigh the minuscule benefits that 400 700ft tall wind turbines will absolutely destroy this area.

The devastation that will come to the area alone should be enough for the BLM to halt this project but the name of the company is very misleading. Since when was there a Magic Valley Energy Company? There is not a local company in the valley that is a local energy company. Our wildlife, our landscape and our area will be destroyed so that the mega watts this produces can be sent to California or some far off area. When something of this magnitude does nothing to benefit our area, I would plead with you, to protect our public lands and not allow this to come to our valley. "
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks"," 
The Minidoka National Historic Site is sacred land to my friends and their families, and we ask that BLM to honor that.    

Established as a National Monument in 2001 and designated as a National Historic Site by Congress, the National Park unit acknowledges the injustice of U.S. Government actions against Japanese Americans in World War II.

For over 20 years, the National Park Services stewardship of the site has served as a source of strength and healing for Japanese Americans and other people of color who have suffered injustice at the hands of our own government.

Minidoka also provides educational opportunities for the public to learn that prejudice against the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities is not new.  It is part of a network of Japanese American camps and other sites of conscience, managed by the National Park Service (NPS) for the benefit of current and future generations. This space serves as a physical reminder of the prejudices the AAPI communities face.  

By law, the National Park Service is required to manage the parks fundamental resources and values unimpaired for future generations. As stated in the Parks Foundation Document, these values include:  

*	Environmental Setting: Minidokas remote location in the high desert of Idaho provides an immersive setting that is fundamental to the visitor experience. Views of open fields and distant mountains create a sense of isolation on a vast landscape where Minidoka once stoodExtreme changes in temperature, the arid environment, and high winds that the people at Minidoka experienced are part of the environmental setting that are felt today. Experiencing this environmental setting allows visitors to better understand and connect to the daily lives at Minidoka.
*	Commemoration and Healing: Minidoka provides a place  for engagement, reflection, and healing. These sites provoke connections to individuals affected by the World War II exclusion, forced removal, and unjust incarceration, and serves to commemorate those who survived this difficult chapter of American history.
*	Public Understanding, Education, and Involvement: Educating and engaging the public in understanding the history of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, the fragile nature of civil rights, and the need to protect civil and constitutional rights in the United States is essential...At Minidoka, special events such as the pilgrimage and the civil liberties symposium connect the public to the history that occurred here and its significance today.

LS Power, a New York private equity firm, is seeking BLM approval to build 400 wind towers as high as 740 feet tall just north of Minidoka, with several towers located on the historic footprint of the camp.  

Approximately 340 towers will be visible from the park on a clear day.   They will form a visual wall of towers that will dominate about one third of the parks 360 degree viewshed.  Each of the towers could be be taller than the Space Needle (604 feet).  With turbine blades the length of the wingspan of a Boeing 747, each of the 340 towers visible from the park will create a visual impact equivalent to a 747 wing rotating on the Space Needle. 

The NPS has stated that the towers ""will fundamentally change the psychological and physical feelings of remoteness and isolation one experiences when visiting Minidoka NHS."" 

By surrounding Minidoka with hundreds of giant wind turbines, the project would make it hard for visitors to draw strength and solace from annual pilgrimages.  It will make it hard to experience that same sense of remoteness and isolation experience by Japanese Americans during World War II.  
  
It is completely unethical for these towers to be placed in a space that is sacred for a community that is already consistently sidelined and ignored as part of the story of America. AAPI people have sacrificed so much for America.  Why must we keep taking more from them?  Why is it always marginalized peoples that we ask for flexibility, again and again?  

There is a reason that this has been maintained as open space for the last 80 years.  It was because the land is sacred. Please consider these peoples pleas to find other space for these towers.  America is vast.  Go elsewhere.  
  
LS Powers proposal would dishonor our nations acknowledgment that the incarceration of Japanese Americans was wrong.

It will destroy Minidokas ability to commemorate ancestors and will destroy Minidokas ability to serve as a place of healing and learning.  
  
It will desecrate sacred ground.  
  
Please, please do the right thing.  You will protect sacred land.  This is not the first time that something like this has been proposed, and LS Power can find other places to go.  

Thank you for your help and service in protecting this land."

"OPP01","1 - General","OPP","General Opposition","As an Idahoan citizen and a strong believer in conserving the rare and beautiful wildlife and scenery of this state, I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed Lava Ridge wind farm. Given that this project will consume 75,000 acres of our valuable BLM land, thereby becoming the largest wind farm on this continent, the negative impact upon the state as a whole will be severe. The windmills, at 275 feet, will be the tallest in Idaho, altering the scenery as seen from many important tourist locations (such as the Craters of the Moon National Park). In addition, these windmills will stand directly in the path of large wildlife migrations, killing birds and bats and infringing upon the territory of ground-dwelling animals such as sage grouse.


Even worse, the wind farm will be very near the Minidoka Japanese Internment site, an important and sacred historical location to the Japanese-American community. Given recent nationwide concerns over racism and hatred toward the Asian community, it is appalling to think that a site of this nature would be overshadowed by such a sprawling and intrusive project. To move ahead with this plan would be to treat Japanese-Americans with the same racist contempt which led to the existence of the Minidoka Internment Camp in the first place.


Rather than the good of Idaho, its minorities, its wildlife, and its natural beauty, the chief concern in the negotiations regarding this project appears to be mere financial gain. While the company spearheading this wind farm purports to be based in the Magic Valley, it is in fact headquartered in New York. The energy produced by the farm will go to the highest bidder, and no benefit to the state is guaranteed. Even if potential benefits could be demonstrated, however, the cost of insulting minorities, trampling upon history, and destroying wildlife is too high to justify the construction of this wind farm."

These stated capture the vast Japanese immigrant pioneers contributions to build America. Their investment in family, home, community and place were great, but all was abruptly lost when the ravages of WWII, blame, and racism drove the military to subject over 120,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans to ten concentration camps throughout America.

The history of Japanese Americans should not compete with the economics framing “environmental justice or energy addressing climate change.” The 35 Japan towns along the west coast were places that held history, stories, culture and home.

We must never allow this brutal denial of rights to be perpetrated again.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Unlawful incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II was a mistake of epic proportions and blatant violation of the United States Constitution, for which the United States government rightfully apologized in 1988.  Today, however, we find ourselves in danger of repeating the mistakes of the past, as evidenced by a rise in prejudice and racism against the Muslim American community.  Therefore, it is imperative that we not repeat our past missteps.  The Minidoka National Historic Site plays a vital part in achieving this goal by educating the public on the history of the internment camps, and recreating the living conditions in the camps during their existence from 1942 to 1945.  Of the 10 internment camps that existed, Minidoka holds personal meaning for our family, in that our mother was interned there as a young girl.

I have learned that a large scale wind farm is proposed for the lands immediately surrounding the Minidoka site.  The wind farm design calls for a multitude of massive windmill structures which will create constant high levels of noise and visual commotion.  An important part of the educational experience of the Minidoka National Historic Site is the recreation of the sense of desolation and hopelessness that residents were forced to live with while in the camps.  My concern is that construction of the wind farm so close to the site will seriously detract from that experience, and lessen the impact of the lessons to be learned from the illegal forcible relocation of American citizens.

While an ardent supporter of the development of renewable energy resources, I ask that an exception be made in this case by considering alternate sites for the wind farm in order to preserve the integrity of the Minidoka experience and keep its memory alive."

So that visitors can truly imagine what it would have been like to spend every day, behind a barbed wire fence, looking out at a place with little hope.

I support Secretary Haaland and President Biden’s push for renewable energy. The extension of the production and investment tax credit (PTC/ITC) programs will incentivize renewables and push fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas out of competition and help meet our goals to combat climate change. I do not object to LS Power’s development of a large wind energy project in Idaho. I understand the benefits of building projects on land owned by the Bureau of Land Management (with 400 wind turbines in other parts of the country, you could be dealing with 400 different landowners and negotiating leases with each of them individually.) I even understand that this location was likely chosen because of proximity to transmission lines and a favorable queue position with the regional transmission operator. But none of these reasons can justify the trauma it would cause survivors of the incarceration camps and their families to see development and modern business carrying on as normal within view of a place with such a troubled history. Our families did not ask to be sent to Minidoka, they were ordered under threat of legal action and punishment, and now the camps serve as landmarks for generations of Japanese Americans for years to come to visit and process their trauma."

Then imagine the upper half+ of each building in constant motion across a view width wider than the average person can see at one time.  Then imagine that the viewer is only 2 miles away from the closest moving building. Then realize that the buildings are actually very tall spinning wind towers.  I certainly hope that they are all together at least as silent as the countryside.

The DEIS should include an environmental justice analysis; and NPS should prepare that analysis because it has “special expertise” regarding the history and injustice of the Nikkei internment.

First and foremost, BLM should recognize the 120,000 Nikkei who were unjustly incarcerated at the 10 internment camps operated by the War Relocation Authority during World War II, as well as their descendants, constitute a “community with environmental justice (EJ) concerns” under applicable federal guidance. That guidance includes: Executive Orders 12898 and 13985; Secretary’s Order 3399; and the Federal Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice & NEPA Committee’s 2016 report titled “Promising Practices for EJ Methodologies in NEPA Reviews.”

In terms of preparing an environmental justice analysis for the DEIS, we call your attention to the CEQ NEPA implementing regulations at 40 CFR §1501.8(b)(3).22 This section provides that the lead agency in a planning process (in this case BLM) can request that a cooperating agency (NPS) “assume responsibility for developing information and preparing environmental analyses [for] portions of the environmental impact statement concerning which the cooperating agency has special expertise.”

NPS clearly has “special expertise” regarding the history and injustice of Nikkei incarcerations at Minidoka and other internment camps and the long lasting impacts that experience has had on the Nikkei community. On the other hand, apparently BLM has no direct or ongoing relationship with the Nikkei survivors and descendants; and based on this proposal also seems to have little knowledge or appreciation of the national significance of Minidoka NHS and the cultural landscape surrounding the internment camp. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that NPS (not BLM) prepare the environmental justice analysis for the EIS."

The injury and mortality would be due to collision with the windmill blades.  These insults have been reported in existing wind projects, most of which have been much smaller than the project in question.  If the project is allowed to proceed, I would advocate it done in stages with time for evaluation of above stated injury and mortality in the first stage before the next stage is allowed, and then a second evaluation before the third stage is sanctioned.  These evaluations should be performed by federal agencies or by contractors under close monitoring by federal agencies.  This oversight is a concern for me due to the experiences of a family member working for an environmental contractor at a wind farm whose observations (my relative's)  were suppressed for fear they would be unfavorable to the entity hiring the contractor.

Studies indicated that most bird and bat species have suffered huge decreases in individuals over the past thirty years.  Severe increases in mortality such as could be caused by a wind energy project as large as Lava Ridge's could throw them over the brink of recovery."

"DATA04","4 - Cumulative Effects Analysis ","DATA","Analysis Methods and Data","Comment # 5: The completion of SWIP Phase III (AKA SWIP North) in Idaho and the Proposed Action appear be “connected actions” under NEPA.

Although the Record of Decision (ROD) for SWIP was issued in 1994, SWIP Phase III (AKA SWIP North), which is a 275-mile 500 kV transmission line between Midpoint Sub-station near Shoshone, Idaho and Robinson Summit in Nevada, has never been constructed.

In December 2020, LS Power reported28 that SWIP North is “permitted but seeking cost recovery” (i.e., construction funding) and that the “project is nearly construction ready and could be online as early as June 2024.” The same report also indicated that SWIP North would provide a link to “Idaho Power Company’s interconnection queue; primarily wind, including a 1050 MW Lava Ridge wind project, being developed by [an] LS Power affiliate that is scheduled to be online in 2024.” (Emphasis added.) It is unclear from that report if a Federal loan guarantee from DOE is needed to support financing of SWIP North; however, if it is, then one would expect DOE to conduct NEPA compliance as it did previously in 2010 for the Federal loan guarantee for SWIP South.

In any case, the long delayed completion of SWIP North (or SWIP Phase III), first approved in 1994, and the proposed Lava Ridge Wind Project are both planned for completion in 2024; both are being
developed by LS Power or an “affiliate’ of LS Power; and both projects would be impractical and ineffective (i.e., useless) without the other. In fact, the map below that was included in LS Power’s December 2020
report geographically illustrates the dependency of one project’s existence upon the completion of the other, and vice versa.

Last but not least, the most recent (July 2021) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) interactive “wind turbine database” map29 for Idaho shows there are no existing wind turbines in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Falls-Midpoint Substation-Shoshone area. In other words, there is no apparent current demand for extending SWIP into Idaho at this time.

Completing the Idaho leg of an interstate high voltage transmission line that terminates in rural Idaho nearly three decades after it was approved, makes no sense unless and until there will be a major energy generation facility near the same terminus. As a result, SWIP North and the Lava Ridge Wind Project appear

to be “connected actions” under NEPA. As described in BLM Permanent Instruction Memorandum No. 2018-02330:

Connected actions are those proposed Federal actions that are “closely related” and “should be discussed” in the same NEPA document (40 CFR 1508.25 (a)(1)). Proposed actions are connected if they automatically trigger other actions that may require an environmental impact statement; cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously; or if the actions are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend upon the larger action for their justification (40 CFR 1508.25 (a)(1)). (Emphasis added.)

If the connected action is also a proposed BLM action, we recommend that you include both actions as aspects of a broader “proposal” (40 CFR 1508.23), analyzed in a single NEPA document. You may either construct an integrated purpose and need statement for both your proposed action and the connected action, or you may present separate purpose and need statements for your proposed action and the connected action. Regardless of the structure of the purpose and need statement(s), you must develop alternatives and mitigation measures for both actions (40 CFR 1508.25(b)), and analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of both actions (40 CFR 1508.25(c)). (Emphasis added.)

We recommend that the DEIS include an analysis of SWIP North (Phase III) and the Lava Ridge Wind Project as “connected actions” under NEPA. If either action “cannot or will not proceed without the other,” then they would be “connected” under NEPA and should be evaluated accordingly in the DEIS."

This includes biologists with the BLM and Idaho Fish and Game in regions that cover the Snake River Plain (Shoshone and Idaho Falls Districts - BLM and Magic Valley, Southeast, and Upper Snake Regions - IDFG) as well as personnel from the National Park Service at Craters of the Moon National Monument, Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge, the Idaho National Laboratory, and BYU-ldaho. Direct consultation is necessary because much of the bat research completed in Idaho remains unpublished. These professionals can provide access to information that I believe will be critical for understanding bats in the project area and avoiding adverse impacts to them, such as: 

o	NABat survey results in and around the proposed Lava Ridge Wind Project,
o	known lava tube caves and other potential roosting and foraging habitat in and around the proposed project area,
o	other local and regional acoustic survey and mist netting results,
o	regional mobile acoustic survey results,

"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","Birds - Like bats, birds are also subject to high levels of mortality as a result of wind turbine collisions and the habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation that accompanies large scale wind developments. Raptors, migrating songbirds, and sage grouse are at highest risk. Taller turbines like the 740 ft tall turbines proposed for installation at the proposed Lava Ridge Wind development may increase collision risk for night-flying migrants that concentrate at heights of 300 - 2000 ft., and for grassland species that engage in aerial displays during courtship. Long term impacts are caused by the cumulative footprint of turbines, roads, powerlines, fences, substations, and other supporting infrastructure that causes habitat disturbance, disrupts foraging, breeding and migration, and increased risk of predation.

"VIS01","1 - General","VIS","Visual Resources","Various studies indicate that large wind turbines in a western landscape can be visible to the human eye up to 36 miles away. For example, a 2011 study1 prepared for the Clean Energy States Alliance found that, “In general, visual impacts are greater when objects are seen at close range. Wind turbines may be seen from 15-25 miles and even farther under optimal atmospheric conditions… If a project dominates the views from highly sensitive viewpoints to such an extent that it would significantly harm scenic resources that are clearly valued within the region, it is likely to have unreasonable or undue visual impacts.” Note: We and many others would consider Minidoka NHS to be a “highly sensitive viewpoint.” In a 2012 study2 prepared by the Argonne National Laboratory for BLM, “377 observations of five wind facilities in Wyoming and Colorado were made under various lighting and weather conditions. The facilities were found to be visible to the unaided eye at >58 km (36 mi) under optimal viewing conditions, with turbine blade movement often visible at 39 km (24 mi).”  

The Lava Ridge Project Area Map3 above illustrates that the majority of wind turbines would be located within 5-20 miles of the NHS. As a result, the proposed wind farm would be highly visible, dominate the landscape, and overwhelm the scenic vistas immediately north and northeast of Minidoka National Historic Site (NHS), thus causing unacceptable impacts to, and likely impairment of, protected resources and values within a unit (or park) of the National Park System.

engage potentially impacted environmental justice communities early in the project planning process. ‘Early in the project planning process’ includes when a Bureau/Office has enough information on a proposed action to determine that an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement will be prepared.” (Emphasis added.)

Obviously, in this case the Nikkei are a community with environmental justice concerns related to this project and therefore must be consulted. However, because BLM did not reach out to the Japanese American community until after scoping had already begun the Bureau has already failed to engage the Nikkei community “early in the project planning process.” Moving forward, it is essential that BLM fully embrace its consultation responsibilities."

"ALT01","1 - General Deficiency, Inadequate Range of Alts","ALT","Alternatives","Comment # 3: Project siting concern: In the interest of transparency, the DEIS should include a summary of communications between BLM and Magic Valley Energy regarding possible locations for this project; and an explanation of the factors considered or not considered in determining the proposed project site (i.e., location).

As background, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Wind Energy Technologies Office states that “[a]reas with annual average wind speeds around 6.5 meters per second and greater at 80-m height are generally considered to have a resource suitable for wind development.”23 However, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind resource map for Idaho (below) indicates that the average wind speed in the vicinity of the Lava Ridge project site just north of Twin Falls is less than the recommended 6.5 meters per second threshold.

This begs the question – why was the project proposed at this location, if the wind energy potential is marginal at best? What other factors were considered, if any?

We understand that MVE may have approached BLM previously (i.e., some years ago) about locating the project south (not north) of Twin Falls. We also understand that MVE was possibly discouraged from applying for a grant to use that location for a wind energy project due to conflicts with greater sage grouse habitat. As a result, MVE proposed the current project site immediately north of Minidoka NHS.

Is this true? And if so, to what extent did BLM suggest or encourage MVE to consider the current proposed site? When considering the current proposed site, to what extent did MVE or BLM consider the project’s obvious, significant, unavoidable, and unmitigable adverse impacts to resources and values at Minidoka NHS, a unit of the National Park System? And why did BLM not suggest or discourage MVE from applying for this site because of the direct conflicts with the conservation of Minidoka’s resources and values?

These questions and concerns relate directly to the previously mentioned executive orders on
environmental justice and Secretary’s Order 3399 on “Restoring Transparency and Integrity to the Decision- Making Process.” To be frank, because of the marginal wind energy potential and the enormity of the potential impacts to Minidoka NHS, proceeding with an EIS to develop a massive wind farm at this particular site defies common sense. BLM must explain in the DEIS how the site selection decision for the proposed action was reached and is being allowed to move forward for detailed analysis. The explanation must be much more in depth than BLM’s typical response of simply saying “this is the site MVE has applied for, so it must be considered.”

In addition to including a summary of communications between MVE and BLM that contributed to the selection of the proposed project site, we ask that the DEIS identify the factors that were considered or dismissed during site selection discussions. This information could be simply summarized in a table in the DEIS that identifies the factor and a check mark identifying whether the factor was considered or not in the siting decision. For example, these factors could or should include:

•	Avoidance of significant conflicts with greater sage grouse habitat;
•	Avoidance of significant conflicts with the conservation of resources and values at Minidoka NHS;
•	Proximity to the future completion of the Southwest Intertie Project (SWIP), an interstate high voltage transmission line project approved in 1994 that is, as yet, not constructed in Idaho;
•	Adequacy of available wind resources that would meet or exceed DOE’s recommended 6.5 meters per second at 80 meters threshold;
•	Consistency with applicable BLM land use plans, including the Monument Resource Management Plan (RMP) and related documents; and
•	Any other factors considered or dismissed by BLM."
"VIS01","1 - General","VIS","Visual Resources","Comment # 4: The DEIS should include a summary of the gaps and shortcomings in applicable BLM land use planning documents as they relate to the Proposed Action and potential adverse impacts to visual resources.

These documents include, but are not limited to, the following:

A.	January 1986 Monument Resources Management Plan (RMP)24: The RMP is grossly outdated and does not serve as a valid basis for justifying the siting of the proposed wind farm. The RMP did not contemplate the creation of Minidoka Internment National Monument by Presidential Proclamation in 2001; or the establishment of Minidoka NHS by act of Congress in 2008. Nor did the RMP include a Visual Resource Management (VRM) inventory, analysis, or classifications25 that would serve as a valid baseline for determining the appropriateness of future development; or, in this case, for evaluating potential visual impacts of the proposed wind farm."
"CUL01","1 - General Cultural Resources","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","Last but not least, the RMP provides little useful guidance regarding the identification and protection of cultural resources within the RMP area. In essence, the RMP fails to comply with Section 110 of the NHPA, which requires federal agencies to identify, evaluate, nominate to the National Register of Historic Places, and protect historic resources within their jurisdiction. However, all the 1986 RMP says is: “BLM will manage cultural resources so that representative samples of the full array of scientific and socio-cultural values are maintained or enhanced, consistent with State and Federal laws.”"
"OOS02","2 - Other Projects","OOS","Out of Scope","994 BLM Record of Decision (ROD) for the Southwest Intertie Project (SWIP)26 – The ROD approved the granting of a public land right-of-way to Idaho Power Company, Boise, Idaho for the construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of the Southwest Intertie 500 kilovolt (kV) electrical transmission line project (SWIP). SWIP would be constructed in phases and eventually provide a high voltage transmission connection between Las Vegas, Nevada and the Midpoint Substation near Shoshone, Idaho.

With regard to the proposed construction of SWIP within the BLM’s Shoshone District (location of the current wind farm proposal), the 1994 ROD stated, “[the Monument RMP], while not specifically designating Right-of-Way corridors, provides that public lands may be considered for the installation of public utilities, except where expressly prohibited by law or regulation. The proposal [i.e., SWIP] is determined to be in conformance with the existing management plan and no amendment to that plan is
necessary.”

Similar to the Monument RMP, the 1994 SWIP ROD did not contemplate the creation of Minidoka Internment National Monument by Presidential Proclamation in 2001; or the establishment of Minidoka NHS by act of Congress in 2008. In addition, the ROD contained no VRM inventory or class determinations that would serve as a baseline for evaluating potential visual impacts of the proposed wind farm.

"ALT01","1 - General Deficiency, Inadequate Range of Alts","ALT","Alternatives","Comment # 6: The DEIS should fully consider a range of “reasonable alternatives” to the proposed action, as required under sections 102(2)(C)(iii) and 102(2)(E) of NEPA.

“Reasonable alternatives” means a reasonable range of alternatives that are technically and economically feasible, meet the purpose and need for the proposed action, and, where applicable, meet the goals of the applicant. See 40 CFR §1508.1(z). We offer the following suggestions related to reasonable alternatives:

•	We suggest that BLM and/or MVE use geographic information system (GIS) mapping technology to identify potential project sites on BLM land that: 1) avoid major conflicts with greater sage grouse habitat; 2) are located in areas with average annual winds of 6.5 meters per second or greater at 80 meters; 3) are within an appropriate distance of the proposed but yet to be completed Idaho segment of SWIP; and 4) are located at least 30 miles from Minidoka NHS. Such sites, if found, should be considered “prime” wind farm locations to fully consider as action alternatives.
•	In the event no such “prime” sites are found, we defer to BLM’s judgment as to which two alternate sites would generally present the less environmentally damaging and sufficiently feasible locations to consider in addition to the proposed action. Obviously, BLM should explain its site selection methodology in the DEIS.
•	The DEIS should identify BLM’s preferred alternative, as required under 40 CFR § 1502.14(d); and, in the interest of transparency, the DEIS should also identify the environmentally preferable alternative.
•	While it may be “reasonable” to consider variations of the proposed action (such as different combinations of mitigation measures proposed at the same site), these variations should be presented as “alternative elements” under the proposed action, rather than as distinctly different alternatives.
•	In practical terms, there should be at least two action alternatives considered that would be located distinctly outside of (i.e., away from) the project area for the proposed action. In
practical terms, “distinctly outside” as used here means located at least 30 miles from Minidoka NHS so as to generally avoid adverse visual impacts to Minidoka.
•	The descriptions of each action alternative, including the proposed action, should include a Class 4 construction cost estimate. We suspect that at some point MVE and/or BLM will use cost differences between action alternatives as justification, in part, for selecting the proposed action, so having a baseline cost estimate for each is essential for comparison purposes.
•	While it is premature to discuss compensatory mitigation for the proposed action under Section 106 of the NHPA, based on other federal projects that have resulted in significant visual impacts to units of the National Park System and/or National Register properties, compensatory mitigation for the Lava Ridge Wind Project at the proposed location could conceivably run into hundreds of millions of dollars. In our view, it would be better project management if BLM were to choose a far less damaging location for the wind farm in the first place, even if construction costs were relatively higher than for the proposed action. For example, if a reasonable alternative located 30+ miles away from Minidoka NHS were to cost $40, $50, or even $75 million or more to construct than the proposed action, it would still be a more cost effective alternative since it would avoid significant adverse effects to Minidoka NHS and the need for costly compensatory mitigation, and possibly litigation.
"
"VIS01","1 - General","VIS","Visual Resources","Comment # 8: There should also be an analysis of visual impacts to Minidoka NHS and the surrounding landscape based on BLM’s Visual Resources Management (VRM) classification system. However, apparently BLM has never conducted a baseline VRM classification for the project area. In order for such as assessment to be credible at this stage of the planning process, BLM and NPS should hire an independent third-party contractor (e.g., Argonne National Laboratory31) to conduct the baseline VRM assessment and classification.

In principle, BLM should already have prepared a baseline VRM assessment and classification during one of its previous land use planning processes for the area. However, as noted previously, the grossly outdated 1986 Monument RMP and the 1994 ROD for the Southwest Intertie Project (SWIP) contained no such assessment; and we can find no such information in any of the other “plans that are in effect” for the Twin Falls District listed on BLM’s Idaho Plans and NEPA webpage.32

As explained on the BLM Visual Resource Management (VRM) Classes website33, “[w]hen Visual Resource Management (VRM) class objectives are designated for the lands in an RMP, management actions and allowable uses are determined that reflect the VRM class objectives.” (Emphasis added.) In other words, it is important to conduct the VRM classification process prior to proposed development; so that the respective VRM class objectives can be fully considered in determining whether the proposed development is appropriate or not. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case for the Lava Ridge project.

From the perspective of Minidoka NHS, a unit of the National Park System and a listed property on the National Register of Historic Places, one would reasonably expect the proper BLM VRM classification for the surrounding landscape to be either:

1)	VRM Class I, with the objective: To preserve the existing character of the landscape. Allowed Level of Change: This class provides for natural ecological changes; however, it does not preclude very limited management activity. The level of change to the characteristic landscape should be very low and must not attract attention; or
2)	VRM Class II, with the objective: To retain the existing character of the landscape. Allowed Level of Change: The level of change to the characteristic landscape should be low. Management activities may be seen, but should not attract the attention of the casual observer. Any changes must repeat the basic elements of form, line, color, and texture found in the predominant natural features of the characteristic landscape.

To be frank, if BLM were to conduct a baseline VRM classification for the project area now after a massive wind farm has already been proposed, the classification results will be controversial regardless of outcome. The results will be viewed either as “unfair” by the project proponent if a VRM Class I or II determination is made that essentially precludes the project from occurring at this site; or will be seen as
“lacking credibility” by the Nikkei and conservation communities if a VRM Class III or IV determination is made that, in effect, minimizes or dismisses legitimate concerns about visual impacts to Minidoka NHS.

As a result, we strongly recommend that BLM and NPS hire an independent third-party contractor (e.g., Argonne National Laboratory34) to conduct such a baseline assessment and VRM classification."
"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","Comment # 9: Studies35 have shown that wind turbines and associated infrastructure can adversely affect wildlife, directly through collisions with turbines and indirectly because of noise pollution, habitat loss, and reduced survival or reproduction.

The species groups most likely to be negatively affected in the areas adjacent to the Lava Ridge Wind Farm are birds and bats. Many species of birds and bats migrate seasonally between habitats and along corridors where they are exposed to wind turbines.

At Minidoka NHS and Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (NMP) bats have been documented to occur, or are likely to occur as both areas are within the species' known ranges. The most vulnerable bat species are migratory hoary bats (Lasiurus cinerus), which are documented to be killed by wind turbines, and resident Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus). Both resident bat species occur and reproduce in Craters of the Moon NMP, especially in the lava tubes, and likely forage in and around Minidoka.

Migratory birds, protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, often migrate along corridors and are attracted to water courses such as occur in and around Minidoka. Golden and Bald eagles are also specifically at risk to collision with wind turbines, and mortalities have been broadly reported. Greater sage- grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been documented in Craters of the Moon and their habitat occurs in both parks."

Kipukas36 are “islands” of vegetation surrounded by more recent lava flows within the greater Craters of the Moon landscape. There are over 500 kipukas in the area, which are vulnerable to spillover of nonnative species. Their ecological uniqueness and value is described in Proclamation 7373 of November 9, 200037, which significantly expanded the boundary of Craters of the Moon National Monument, then managed solely by NPS, to create the much larger national monument and preserve with portions managed by BLM and NPS respectively. As stated in the Proclamation:

The kipukas provide a window on vegetative communities of the past that have been erased from most of the Snake River Plain… [K]ipukas represent some of the last nearly pristine and undisturbed vegetation in the Snake River Plain, including 700-year-old juniper trees and relict stands of sagebrush that are essential habitat for sensitive sage grouse populations.

We have heard that BLM may have considered preparing its NEPA review in advance of and separately from its NHPA Section 106 and ESA Section 107 consultations. However, the guidance in the CEQ NEPA implementing regulations is clear – the respective consultation requirements should be conducted coincident with the NEPA review. And the resulting documentation should be integrated into one document, the DEIS, subject to public comment at the same time as the NEPA analysis."
"DECI05","5 - Section 106 Consultation ","DECI","Decision Process","Comment # 11: The potential for significant adverse effects to visual resources at National Register- listed Minidoka NHS and on the surrounding agricultural landscape are of utmost concern during the Section 106 consultation and evaluation process. The agencies, the Idaho SHPO, and the Nikkei community should formally request the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to actively early participate in the Section 106 consultation process.

While comments # 7 and 8 above focus on analyzing visual impacts under the NEPA review process, this comment (#11) focuses on the Section 106 consultation process and assessment of adverse effects under the NHPA.

As discussed previously, the number and size of wind turbines proposed at Lava Ridge by MVE will dominate the landscape and overwhelm the scenic vistas immediately north and northeast of Minidoka National Historic Site, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a result, the adverse effects of the Proposed Action are essentially unavoidable and unmitigable. BLM should not pretend otherwise. Key questions during the Section 106 consultation process include:

•	Will the proposed undertaking directly or indirectly alter characteristics of Minidoka NHS (or the potentially eligible rural historic landscape encompassing the original 33,000 acre footprint of the camp) that qualify (or potentially qualifies) the site (s) for inclusion in the National Register?
•	Will the Proposed Action diminish the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association?

We believe the answers to these questions are obvious, based on the size and extent of the proposed wind farm illustrated on the several site maps included in this letter. As a result, early participation by ACHP in the consultation process is not only beneficial, it is essential!

As described on ACHP’s Office of Federal Agency Programs (OFAP) website38, “a project may have substantial adverse effects or if important policy or procedural questions are raised, the ACHP may elect to participate in the consultation process.” OFAP manages the ACHP’s participation in Section 106 consultation and provides guidance, advice, and technical assistance to federal agencies and other participants in the Section 106 process. When historic properties will be adversely affected by a federal undertaking, the review usually concludes with the execution of a legally binding agreement that outlines how the federal agency will resolve those effects. In rare circumstances where agreement cannot be reached, the ACHP issues advisory comments to the head of the federal agency who must then consider them in making a final decision about whether the project will proceed.

We urge BLM, NPS, the Idaho SHPO and the Nikkei community to formally request the early participation of the ACHP in the Section 106 consultation process consistent with ACHP regulations in 36 CFR Part 80039. For example, 36 CFR Section 800.2(b)(1) addresses “Council entry into the section 106 process”, as follows: When the Council determines that its involvement is necessary to ensure that the purposes of section 106 and the act are met, the Council may enter the section 106 process. Criteria guiding Council decisions to enter the section 106 process are found in Appendix A to this part. The Council will document that the criteria have been met and notify the parties to the section 106 process as required by this part.

In addition, Appendix A, section (b), states, in part: “The Council may choose to exercise its authorities under the section 106 regulations to participate in an individual project pursuant to the following criteria.” The criteria listed under section (c) for ACHP involvement includes when an undertaking: (1) Has substantial impacts on important historic properties. (2) Presents important questions of policy or interpretation. (3) Has the potential for presenting procedural problems. This may include cases with substantial public controversy that is related to historic preservation issues; with disputes among or about consulting parties which the Council's involvement could help resolve; [or] that are involved or likely to be involved in litigation on the basis of section 106.

In this case, more than one, if not all, of the criteria have been or will be met. Therefore, ACHP involvement throughout the Section 106 consultation process is appropriate; and, we believe, essential to successful project management that reduces the likelihood of costly compensatory mitigation and/or litigation."

While this may make consultation and protective efforts more difficult, it is important to recognize and acknowledge past wrongs and a certain degree of mistrust that First Nation peoples may feel regarding the release of protected information, tribal history, and cultural identification.

"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","We appreciate the fact that the project area was selected in part because it is classified outside of Priority or Important Habitat Management Areas. It is located partially within a General Sage-grouse Habitat Management Area and there are at least three sage-grouse leks within the larger project area. We support the application of a 3.1 mile buffer between the leks and associated infrastructure such as turbines, roads and transmission lines. 

We feel this level of caution is warranted. Road construction and use associated with transmission line maintenance represent high risk for loss of lek areas, nesting locations, and brood-rearing habitats (Braun 1986, Connelly et al. 2004). ,   In addition, sage-grouse have been shown to avoid transmission lines, presumably because of potential predation. Ellis (1985) found a 72% decline in the average of males on leks and a 65% increase in predation efforts involving raptors following the construction of a transmission line within 200 m of an active sage-grouse lek in northeastern Utah.  Sage-grouse lek attendance dropped significantly following power line construction within 3 miles of leks in California.  In a comprehensive study of ecological requirements, sage-grouse were extirpated in areas where power line densities were above 0.20 km/km2 and sage-grouse habitat was ranked highest where power lines were less than 0.06 km/km2."
"WILD02","2 - Big Game ","WILD","General Wildlife","We are also concerned about how big game patterns may be influenced by snow depth within the project area and recommend that the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power consider how wildlife movement may change during high snow years. Some important overwintering habitat for both big game and sage-grouse may not be apparent until high snow events. These overwintering areas or winter refuges may be marked by landforms with southern exposures where bitterbrush and other forage is more readily accessible. Snow plowing activities during project construction and operation may also alter big game movement through the area. Big game often travel on plowed roads during periods of deep snow and plowed snow banks may make it harder for them to leave the road. As a result, big game may be more vulnerable to vehicle collisions. There may be ways to reduce adverse effects by reducing vehicle speeds in certain areas or incorporating ramps into snow plowing activities. "
"SOC03","3 - Environmental Justice","SOC","Socioeconomics","One of the major components of reaching carbon neutrality for the state of Idaho is to increase the development of clean energy sources. Utility-scale renewable energy projects like Lava Ridge are at the proper scale to begin addressing the inevitable need for renewable energy in the state. However, these renewable projects must fit within the landscape in which they are proposed. The BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should design this project to not only address the larger climatic impacts but also in a way that recognizes and addresses the local socio-cultural and environmental impacts. 

Public infrastructure often faces issues of equity and justice. Energy generation can be cited as an example, with coal mines and coal-fired power plants as having disproportionate negative effects on historically marginalized or underserved communities. Some of our most vulnerable communities are those most affected by climate change. By mitigating impacts from climate change, we can try to improve the conditions for many of our disadvantaged communities. Therefore, climate justice should be accounted for when assessing projects for renewable energy infrastructure."

Magic Valley Energy/LS Power and the BLM must comply with several federal and state laws and regulations that are meant to protect these irreplaceable resources.  These statutes include Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and related Code of Federal Regulations, the Archaeological resources Protection Act of 1979, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,  Idaho Code title 67, Chapter 41, and Idaho Code title 27, Chapter 5 (Sections 27-502 through 27-504)."
"CUL01","1 - General Cultural Resources","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","Archaeologists have identified numerous lava tubes and caves containing pre-and protohistoric cultural remains throughout the region, and it remains quite likely that investigators will discover previously unidentified cultural resources during pedestrian surveys of the direct impact areas.  The BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should avoid these resources whenever possible by relocating proposed roads, turbines, and associated infrastructure, and mitigate the impacts to these resources through excavation and data recovery efforts when necessary.  The forthcoming EIS should include a comprehensive data recovery plan that details the types of resources within the project area, how Magic Valley Energy/LS Power, the BLM, and any associated subcontractors will proactively engage in applying pertinent research questions to data recovery. The DEIS should also discuss the process for the potential curation of recovered artifacts in a State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) approved repository. All such discoveries and any curation should be conducted in coordination with the Shoshone-Bannock and Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. 

These investigations should also determine indirect impacts to cultural resources from increased visitation and exposure during construction activities and increased travel on wind farm-associated service roads and near infrastructure facilities.  The BLM should consider requiring mitigation options that could include fencing to protect particularly rare or sensitive archaeological sites, such as Wilson Butte Cave, as well as avoidance by relocating proposed turbines or infrastructure.  National Historic Trails and Native American traditional cultural properties (TCPs) are two examples of rare or sensitive resources that we feel the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should be respectful and sensitive towards by avoiding construction in these areas.

"PUBL03","3 - Public Outreach/Availability of Info","PUBL","Public and Stakeholder Involvement","We encourage the BLM to work with local representatives of the Japanese American community to reach the much broader diaspora of the impacted community. Once camp detainees were released in 1944, some chose to remain in Idaho, settling in the Magic Valley, eastern Idaho, and the Boise area while others dispersed throughout the country.  We recommend that the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power seek out these communities of Japanese Americans whose lives were shaped by the injustices forced upon themselves and their ancestors, and consult with the National Park Service to reduce the potential impacts to the Minidoka National Historic Site.  This is not only a matter of NEPA compliance, it is an issue of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice that must be adequately addressed prior to construction approval. "

The exact distance could be based on discussions between members of the Japanese American community, the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power. There may also be sites of cultural significance to Shoshone-Bannock and Shoshone-Paiute tribal members that could be addressed through similar means.

"OOS02","2 - Other Projects","OOS","Out of Scope","In ICL’s 2011 comments on the China Mountain Wind Project, we had also recommended amending the Jarbidge Resource Management Plan to clearly remove Sage-grouse Priority and Important Habitat Management Areas in the Browns Bench/China Mountain area from consideration for energy development projects. The China Mountain Wind project was originally proposed by Renewable Energy Systems (RES) and fortunately did not move forward, but our recommended protections for sage-grouse were never instituted. While the State of Idaho’s Sage-grouse Management Plan and the BLM’s Amended Resource Management Plans discouraged wind energy development in and around the Browns Bench area, there was still enough wiggle room to potentially configure a project in the area. As a result, LS Power spent significant resources investigating the potential for developing its own wind project in the vicinity of the Browns Bench area. LS Power also investigated pursuing a wind development west of Oakley known as the Big Cedar Project west of Oakley. Both project areas had high potential for conflicts with sage-grouse. LS Power eventually decided to move forward with the Lava Ridge project instead which is located outside of Sage-grouse Priority and Important Habitat Management Areas, a move we support. We are concerned that, with the completion of the SWIP North transmission line, other developers may again attempt to pursue a project in or around the Browns Bench or Big Cedar Project areas and that the protections provided by the State and BLM ARMPA are still not sufficiently protective. We note that sage-grouse concerns resulted in the Cotterrel area being Congressionally withdrawn from wind development before the Cotterrel Wind Project could be constructed. We believe that a resource management plan amendment or some other action needs to be taken to protect sage-grouse in the Browns Bench, Big Cedar and similar areas."
"PUBL04","4 - Tribal Coordination ","PUBL","Public and Stakeholder Involvement","We understand that the BLM has already initiated consultation with the Shoshone Bannock and Shoshone Paiute Tribes through a government to government relationship regarding this project. The BLM should determine if any Traditional Cultural Properties, sensitive natural resources integral to cultural identity, or sites that fall under the purview of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act are within the proposed project area.  Potential tribes to include in this consultation include, but are not limited to:  The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe of the Duck Valley Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and other Shoshone-Paiute peoples.  These efforts must extend beyond a single letter asking if the Tribal governments are interested in participating in a cultural consultation, as has been the case for previous large projects throughout the West.  
"
"VIS01","1 - General","VIS","Visual Resources","At minimum, the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should create a viewshed of the project site, including all locations that would be in view of the wind turbines and associated above-ground electrical lines. These viewsheds could even inform models of scenic quality, such as Natural Capital Project’s Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) scenic quality model.  These landscape-level GIS analyses are an important first step in the visual resource impact modeling and management process.

The next step of this visualization would be to create a visual model of the view(s) at important cultural sites including the Oregon National Historic Trail, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, and Minidoka National Historic Site.  These visualizations should include the range of alternatives proposed throughout the NEPA process so that members of the public can accurately value the impact of the Lava Ridge infrastructure on the scenic quality of all areas within the project’s viewshed.

The BLM should not rely on the types of displays that are customarily in use at public meetings or photographs that are commonly used in paper copies of a DEIS. In person meetings are in question due to Covid and members of the public interested in this project span the entire continent. The technology exists to allow for visual simulations accessible via computer. Just as Google Maps can transport any user to a street view on the ground, for this project the BLM should allow any member of the public to transport themselves to any one of several observation points. These observation points would be based on a photograph and be overlaid with the wind turbine and transmission lines configuration per each alternative. It should even be possible to allow people to scroll left or right for a 180 degree view of the landscape and to zoom in as desired. This immersive technology is currently readily available and could be adapted to incorporate the range of alternatives. We recommend selecting several key observation points from the Minidoka National Historic Site, one or more from Craters of the Moon, and one each at Wilson Butte, Cinder Butte, Owinza Butte, Sid Butte and Kimama Butte. 

It is important to not stop at the modeling of viewsheds and visualizations. These materials can provide sources in which to evaluate and manage the scenic and visual resources in the project area. For example, the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power could have members of the public and of target stakeholder groups prioritize the visual models from most to least visually appealing, thus creating a scale of valuation for scenic and visual impacts of the project proposal. Furthermore, economic valuations such as a contingent valuation study or hedonic pricing model could evaluate the economic impact of the Lava Ridge project on the surrounding area.
"
"ALT03","3 - Suggested Modification to Existing Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","In terms of mitigating visual impacts, on a visit to the Minidoka National Historic Site we noted that there is an existing transmission line in the direct line of sight just north of the Site. This transmission line was presumably constructed after the internment camp closed but before the official designation of the site as a National Historic Site. The transmission line presents a notable incongruence from the surrounding landscape. It may be worth exploring the feasibility of relocating or burying a portion of this transmission line as part of mitigation efforts for the Lava Ridge project. Depending on the alternative selected, there may be some improvements to visitor experiences if the transmission line is removed from the viewshed. The BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should discuss this and other potential alternatives with the National Park Service and members of the Japanese American community and see if such a proposal is of interest to them. This discussion could lead to other creative and innovative mitigation opportunities as well."
"DATA02","2 - Inadequate Analysis/Inaccurate Data","DATA","Analysis Methods and Data","The scoping notice states that the majority of project infrastructure would be located within a series of ½ mile wide corridors for turbines and power lines separated by roughly ½ mile of undisturbed lands between the corridors. The total cumulative acreage within these corridors is 73,000 acres and the BLM is utilizing that figure to to describe the scale of the project. The implication is that the swaths of public lands that are located between the developed corridors will not be affected by the project. However, the indirect effects on wildfire management, wildlife, livestock management and other resources will certainly include the areas between the corridors. The DEIS needs to describe the combined acreage both within and between the corridors to give the public a better understanding of the scale of the project.  The DEIS should also note that not all lands within these ½ mile corridors will be developed or altered. As mentioned previously, the DEIS also needs to acknowledge that the visual effects will also extend far beyond this area and provide an in-depth analysis of the viewsheds  from the landscapes and communities surrounding the project area.

To designate a historic site, and then wreck it by placing massive wind turbines next to it, is inflicting yet another harm – this time on the legacy of Japanese Americans. How dare you do this to us?! It is unconscionable. 
Since learning about this massive wind farm project, it has been in my thoughts non-stop, and I’ve had trouble sleeping. My family and entire lineage were incarcerated at Minidoka. I think about their suffering, and now the trauma that this project is causing to me personally. I am furious. I am hurt. I feel betrayed.

I believe there must be alternatives to the project that can be found in partnership with those who seek to preserve the historical integrity of the Minidoka site."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","       I attended the Virtual Public Scoping Meeting on Thursday, September 9, 2021, and was concerned by the close proximity of the wind turbines to the Minidoka National Historic Site (MNHS). The visuals available at the time did not identify where the National Park Service site was located in relationship to the proposed wind turbines. Kasey Prestwich, project manager of the BLM Shoshone Field Office, emailed me a better map before the public comment deadline. From what I could tell, the wind turbines would meet the qualifications of a one mile buffer which is the required distance, but the wind turbines would be clearly visible from MNHS. "

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","First, the National Park Service, included in its Mission, is to preserve the appearance of (the Viewshed) its sites for future generations to appreciate undeveloped.  This must include some lands surrounding the Park Services’ Historical Sites, which includes the Minidoka National Historical Site.  This open, barren land is an integral part of what actually occurred at that time and should be included to remain true to the Park Service’s Mission.
I was surprised that there was no mention of the Minidoka Historic Site in the Lave Ridge Wind Project Plan of Development.  Worse, the proposed footprint of the windmills is actually in the Historic Site plat!  I’m sure no other Historic Site would allow this?
Worse, with an estimated elevation of between 350-650 feet, the windmills will have a significant footprint, disrupting the horizons of the camp, even if they are only 350 feet tall.  If they are taller, I used 500 feet for example, the visual pollution of 300-500 windmills will destroy the viewshed of Minidoka unless a very large ‘buffer’ zone is required, the taller the windmills, the wider the buffer. 
Second, I am amazed at the background sound a windfarm can generate.  The frequencies carry along the ground and become a constant buzzing.  Residents that live around other large wind farms will corroborate this issue.  Without adequate distance, a windfarm of the proposed scale must be evaluated for this issue and some consideration made for the residences.  I am sure the National Park Service would not allow this kind of noise pollution for a site like Gettysburg or Grand Tetons?  
Third, the proposed site will be essentially a power station like American Falls Idaho on the Snake River.  The power generation is dwarfed by the menagerie of wires, power poles, and lights.  Besides the light pollution, the buzzing turbines, buzzing power lines, the spin up / spin down cycles, means the viewshed will be constantly polluted with sound, light, and motion.  How is that supposed to help preserve the importance of the Minidoka Historical Site?"

I encourage BLM to develop alternatives that do not impair Minidoka’s important values, as defined by the National Park Service: 
Environmental Setting: “Minidoka’s remote location in the high desert of Idaho provides an immersive setting that is fundamental to the visitor experience. Views of open fields and distant mountains create a sense of isolation on a vast landscape where Minidoka once stood…Extreme changes in temperature, the arid environment, and high winds that the people at Minidoka experienced are part of the environmental setting that are felt today. Experiencing this environmental setting allows visitors to better understand and connect to the daily lives at Minidoka.”

Place for Commemoration and Healing: Minidoka provides a place “… for engagement, reflection, and healing. These sites provoke connections to individuals affected by the World War II exclusion, forced removal, and unjust incarceration, and serves to commemorate those who survived this difficult chapter of American history.” 

Resource for Public Understanding, Education, and Involvement: “Educating and engaging the public in understanding the history of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, the fragile nature of civil rights, and the need to protect civil and constitutional rights in the United States is essential...At Minidoka, special events such as the pilgrimage and the civil liberties symposium connect the public to the history that occurred here and its significance today.”

It’s very important to keep this historical site alive in order to teach others who don’t know about the incarceration of innocent people.  Minidoka is just as important to our country as Gettysburg and George Washington’s home, two places I have been able to visit besides Minidoka.

We feel SLC met this commitment over 25 years ago to the level that the AUMs should have been reinstated.  We made major investments in the resource and spent nearly one hundred thousand dollars on a production study to prove our case. For twenty years the BLM has failed to act on our request.

The Act requires the Secretary to establish a program within the National Park Service “for the purpose of identifying, researching, evaluating, interpreting, protecting, restoring, repairing, and acquiring “historic confinement sites in order that present and future generations may learn and gain inspiration from these sites and that these sites will demonstrate the Nation’s commitment to equal justice under the law.” (Emphasis added.) As stated in the law, this is an “all of the above” mandate; not a discretionary or “none of the above” decision option for Interior agencies.

The proposed action, a massive wind farm development with up to 400 wind turbines with a maximum height of up to 740 feet, will be highly visible, dominate the landscape, and overwhelm the scenic vistas immediately north and northeast of Minidoka National Historic Site (NHS). Moving forward with the proposed action, as described, would be the antithesis of the Act’s mandate to right the injustice of Nikkei incarcerations and demonstrate the “Nation’s commitment to equal justice under the law.”

To be frank, BLM’s proposed action seems ignorant of or indifferent to the unjust treatment suffered by or the amazing resiliency demonstrated by the Nikkei community at Minidoka during one of the gravest American civil rights injustices of the 20th century. Consistent with P.L. 109-441, BLM should fully embrace its consultation responsibilities with the Nikkei community, listen to their concerns, and consider the historical and cultural context of the Minidoka landscape that BLM’s proposed action would irreparably harm.

It is abhorrent that the Bureau of Land Management is even considering a proposal to allow Lava Ridge Wind Project to be in full view of this historic site.  With 400 wind turbines, it is going against the values of the NPS and will completely change the experience. Minidoka's remote location provides an incredibly powerful immersive location with wide open fields to create a sense of isolation where Minidoka once stood.

Place is powerful.  The National Parks Service provides the public with that connection to many places of ecological, cultural, and historical significance including Minidoka National Historic Site.   For twenty years, it has managed Minidoka to educate and engage the public in understanding this history.  Much is at stake in our democracy when fear takes hold and the need to commit to our civil and human rights become even more essential.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","My concerns with respect to the Magic Valley project relate to its potential impacts on the MNHS . As you may be aware, during World War II, almost 13,000 Japanese Americans were unjustly incarcerated at the Minidoka War  Relocation Center (MWRC) from 1942 to 1945. Among those incarcerated were my father (Calvin Ninomiya), my aunt (Rose Masuda), and their parents (Kamesaku and Tetsu Ninomiya). 

The MWRC, like other Japanese-American incarceration centers, was intentionally placed by the U.S. Government in a remote and desolate location, far away from major centers of population. This isolated and forbidding setting was a defining characteristic of the MWRC to the thousands who were incarcerated there.

Magic Valley's proposed project would effectively destroy this defining characteristic, dotting the the landscape immediately surrounding the MNHS with hundreds of highly visible wind turbines, as well as associated energy transmission lines, roads, maintenance facilities, and other infrastructure.&nbsp; I last visited the MNHS in 2010. 

I can attest that the sense of isolation and remoteness experienced by my father and his family remains, and strongly evokes the conditions faced by those who were brought there against their will almost eight decades ago.

It is essential both to honor the memory of those who were wrongfully imprisoned and to remind and educate current and future generations about that dark chapter in our nation's history."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The Manzanar Committee opposes the Lava Ridge Wind Project proposed by the Bureau of Land Management. While we are in agreement with the Biden Administration that we need clean energy to reduce our collective carbon footprint on the planet, the Manzanar Committee believes that building the 400-unit wind turbine field would do irreparable harm to the Minidoka National Historic Site. 

The Manzanar Committee is dedicated to the preservation of the Manzanar National Historic Site and education around the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans. A few years ago, a similar project to the Lava Ridge Wind Project was proposed at a site adjacent to Manzanar that would have provided solar energy to Los Angeles. While such projects are desperately needed to combat climate change, the Manzanar Committee and the surrounding community, including the local Paiute and Shoshone activists, objected to the project because it would have damaged their lands and ruined the educational and cultural benefits from visiting the Manzanar National Historic Site 

In our opinion, the Lava Ridge Wind Project will even have a greater negative impact on the Minidoka National Historic Site. Parts of the project will actually sit on land that was once part of the Minidoka concentration camp where thousands of Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II. To many Japanese Americans, Minidoka and other incarceration sites are “tangible reminders of one of the most serious and painful contradictions of our country’s philosophy of freedom.” It is sacred ground that tells how “over 110,000 loyal Americans were wrenched from their homes and forcibly detained without due process….it is a memorial to the suffering and remarkable courage of the Japanese Americans of that time”. -the story of how a group of people can be imprisoned because of their race.

Sites like Minidoka and Manzanar were created as National Historic Sites because the government understood the value of the site as an educational tool for all Americans. Please respect our story and the land and stop the Lava Ridge Wind Project."

The memories of pain and loss and unspeakable humiliation and shame came welling up.  Being there with my grandchildren, sharing my stories, feeling their intense interest and love, being in a community of other survivors and families, walking the place that was once a concentration camp imprisoning families and is now a National Historic Site  designed to educate the world about what happened to us, made me feel proud and humbled and loved and, well, like I belonged.  I guess youd say it was a healing experience.

An increasing number of visitors -- not just Japanese Americans and camp survivor descendants -- are visiting concentration camps to learn about a painful past in relation to the present. Well-attended virtual tours were conducted this year due to the pandemic.

It is certainly more than ironic that the Minidoka site -- a desolate area where dispossessed and dislocated Japanese Americans were isolated from the rest of the country during the war-- is now considered a valuable resource for the Lava Wind Ridge Project.

I am a 3rd generation Japanese American (sansei) and my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles were incarcerated in American concentration camps during WWII solely because of their Japanese ancestry.   Through the decades Ive come to understand and feel the multigenerational impacts of this trauma on my family and community.  Ive come to understand the self effacing way my parents walked through the world as related to them having been ripped from their homes, their schools, their friends, their communities and being forced to spend their formative adolescent years behind barbed wire solely because of their ancestry.  Ive also come to appreciate the way they went on to build a loving home and family and successful full lives as exemplary of tremendous inner strength and fortitude.  Nonetheless, the deep emotional scars prevail and encouraging my parents to share their stories about the incarceration experience with my children, their grandchildren, has been profoundly healing for them and for me.  

 

For my family, participating in the Minidoka Pilgrimmage is a pilgrimage in the truest sense of the word.  Its a journey to a sacred place, our hallowed ground.  To walk the dusty pathways, to visit the restored barracks and mess hall, to feel the hot breeze, to experience the remoteness and isolation of the place, while hearing stories of survivors nothing can replace this for deep healing and learning and community building.  

 

I very much support wind and other clean renewable energy sources as essential for addressing the climate crisis.  I strongly urge the Bureau of Land Management to find another location for this wind power project where it wont desecrate our Japanese American family and communitys sacred ground.

"PROJ01","1 - General","PROJ","Project Description","During the September 9, 2021 Lava Ridge Wind Project (LRWP) public scoping meeting the Magic Valley Energy LLC (MVE) representative was very evasive, in my opinion, when responding to a question by someone in the audience (not me) about who were the investors in this project (or how the investors might benefit from this project).

I do not recall the MVE representative saying that Magic Valley Energy LLC is a unit of LS Power, or that LS Power is a New York City based private equity firm which appears, both from its web site and the LRWP Plan of Development (POD), to raise its capital through private investors.  Funds raised by publicly traded companies are one thing, funds raised by private equity firms for projects on public lands are quite another.

Since this project, if approved, would become part of the electrical grid critical infrastructure it seems to follow the project also would have national security implications.

Based on the POD, it appears MVE will raise the capital needed for this project with administrative fund-raising support furnished by LS Power.

Has the project fund raising been done?  It appears this will be private equity fund raising venture.  How does BLM know who the private investors are (or will be) and whether or not those investors, or their companies/countries, might be considered potential national security threats by the US Government?  If the fund raising occurs after a Right of Way (ROW) permit is issued, how will BLM ensure investors do not pose potential national security concerns to the project?

If potential national security questions come to light during the financial analysis, how will BLM deal with that?

There is also the issue of land ownership.  On page 24 of the LRWP POD LS Power notes real estate rights are one of the strong points of its purported strong financial position. This project is proposed to be built on public land.  How will BLM protect public land ownership rights (and related rights) if a Right of Way (ROW) permit is issued?

Because of the above, I am asking BLM evaluate this project not only from the financial viability perspective but also a national security perspective because of the possibility of foreign investment in the project which is not transparent because it is a private equity funded event.

I ask also that BLM conduct an intense financial evaluation, more than what BLM would normally conduct of publicly traded companies, of both Magic Valley Energy LLC and LS Power to include financial evaluations of the individual investors who will be funding this project and the claims made in the POD, page 24.  Perhaps including full background investigations of the parties investing in this project might be appropriate since the project might, if approved, effect national security.

There is precedence for intense financial reviews by Federal agencies.  The Tamarack Resort project in Valley County, Idaho in the early 2000s was financially evaluated by the US Forest Service (USFS) because the project involved at least partial use of USFS managed land. USFS issued an opinion that the developers did not have sufficient financial means to complete the project.  The project was later partially built, before it filed for bankruptcy, on non - USFS property.  As I recall the developers were privately funded.

I attended the Minidoka Pilgrimage with my grandmother and, though she was incarcerated at a different site, the experience was eye-opening. I cannot fathom how my familys experience of healing and learning on the pilgrimage would have been impacted by the intrusive project proposed to you. 


This is a sacred site for our community on many levels, but it is also a sacred site for any American who understands the importance of our history and is compelled to ensure it is not repeated. It is an irreplaceable site: the experience of looking out into the expansiveness, beyond the barbed wire fence, and feeling connected to the past, is like no other. It is not something that can be taught in a book. 


My community has endured such pain and loss at this site and has engaged in beautiful healing and reflection. It is at once a marker of the horrors inflicted on us and a reminder of the depth of our strength.

They and their extended families were interred at the Minidoka Interment Camp.  Although, they rarely talked about their camp life, I did hear snippets of what it was like to be taken from their home in Portland, Oregon to Minidoka.  I learned about their loss of home/business, racism and fear of the unknown that they suffered at a remote area that was hastily built.  In 2018, the last member of my family that was sent there passed.  I wish that I had asked more questions about their time in camp.   

A few years ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Minidoka Historical Site.  Seeing it in person, brought to life the stories that I heard and those that I did not hear.  My mother talked about the tower, the housing and how cold and windy it was.  The day I visited was a cold windy day, and I felt how isolated the camp was.  It was very moving for me to see my youngest uncle’s name on the Honor Roll wall.  He died just 7 months before the end of WWII. 

I’ve seen the wind turbines along the Columbia Gorge that take away the spaciousness of that area.  The proposed wind turbines on and near the site would extremely diminish the impact that future visitors would see and feel. It is disrespectful to all those whose lives were gravely impacted by the injustice of being incarcerated at this site.

I believe that this project will severely impact the viewshed of the Minidoka NHS and the sense of remoteness that had a severe impact on those that were placed in these camps throughout the west. This remote location was intentional, if it was not they would have remained in more hospitable locations where they were initially gathered like Puyallup.




With over 400 turbines up 750 ft. tall, some of which will be placed within the original site of the camp perimeter, and the associated transmission lines, this project will have a large impact on the viewshed of the National Historic Site. Given that the viewshed, particularly the vastness of the landscape around the camp, is one of the defining characteristic of the site and is mentioned in the draft Historic Landscape report, I expect that the BLM will engage in a constructive manner with the remaining prisoners that were placed in this camp or with there descendants to ensure that their concerns about the impacts this project will have on the Minidoka National Historic Site are addressed"

nearly 120,000 people of Japanese ethnicity were forcibly removed from the west coast
and incarcerated without justification largely at ten American concentration camps of
which Minidoka is one. Incarcerees at Minidoka came from the Pacific Northwest areas
of the country including the states of Alaska, Washington, and Oregon. With its
population of over 9,000, Minidoka was larger than all but seven cities in Idaho at the
time.
A key feature of the Minidoka site, as with all of the incarceration sites, is the
remoteness and desolation. These sites were intentionally placed in the locations where
they were because of the absence of much else nearby except for the train tracks upon
which incarcerees were transported from their homes.
Key to the experience of interpreting the experience of incarceration for historic
preservation are the desolate vistas and geographic features of the surrounding area. In
the National Park Service’s Long Range Interpretive Plan published in 2103, it notes
“The NPS will work with park neighbors, using the wide variety of resources
available, to maintain and protect the integrity of the historic vistas and other historic
elements related to the camp experience.” NPS recognizes the importance of the
historic viewshed to the interpretive experience as being just as important as the
physical components of the Minidoka interpretive experience.
Similarly, in the 2006 General Management Plan, NPS notes:
Comprehensive cultural resource management practices will include the
stewardship, protection, and preservation of historic elements such as
landscape features, structures, buildings, and remnants of the historic
circulation system. Research will continue to identify, evaluate, and
document information related to Minidoka. Appropriate treatments for
the cultural landscape are based on broad public support for the accurate
depiction of living conditions in the camp, and more importantly, historic
features that demonstrated confinement and loss of freedom, as well as
features that reveal the Nikkei’s responses to confinement.
On a clear day one can see for over 20 miles around the Minidoka site. Completion of
the Lava Ridge project will inevitably destroy the ability of the Minidoka site to
effectively convey the sense of confinement and loss of freedom."

Placing a wind farm within eyesight of the site would be disrespectful to the uncertainty, dehumanization, and mental suffering that Japanese Americans had to go through at the hand of the U.S. government. 

Furthermore, the vastness of the desert around Minidoka allows visitors to feel first-hand the isolation and desolate nature of the site. It is necessary for visitors to be able to relate themselves to the confusion and fear Japanese Americans felt upon arrival to the unfamiliar location.

40 CFR § 1501.8 provides that the lead agency may request a cooperating agency with “special expertise” to prepare portion(s) of the NEPA review document(s). In this case, NPS has special expertise regarding the management and conservation of resources and values at Minidoka NHS.

The analysis to be prepared by NPS should include a detailed analysis of visual resource (or

We defer to NPS to identify key viewpoints that are representative of the historical landscape setting of the internment camp and important resource values to be conserved, as described in the NPS Foundation Document. These values include views of open fields and distant mountains that create a sense of isolation on the vast landscape where Minidoka once stood. Experiencing this environmental setting allows visitors to better understand and connect to the daily lives of the Nikkei who were unjustly incarcerated at Minidoka.

As part of preparing this impact analysis for the DEIS, NPS should also prepare an “impairment

If appropriate, BLM should prepare National Register nominations for any eligible but unlisted historic properties within the area.

In general, the Monument RMP description of BLM’s management of cultural resources within the RMP area is remarkably brief. All it says is: “BLM will manage cultural resources so that representative samples of the full array of scientific and socio-cultural values are maintained or enhanced, consistent with State and Federal laws.” See RMP p. 16.

While the NPS-managed Minidoka NHS encompasses only about 500 acres of the original 33,000- acre footprint of the Minidoka War Relocation Center, a significant portion of the larger footprint of Minidoka overlaps thousands of acres of public lands administered by BLM. See BLM map below that illustrates the overlap.

Section 110 of the NHPA requires federal agencies “to manage and maintain historic properties under the jurisdiction or control of the agency in a way that considers the preservation of their historic, archeological, architectural, and cultural values. These responsibilities include the identification, evaluation, nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, and protection of historic resources.” (Emphasis added.)

As a result, BLM should specifically determine whether the broader agricultural landscape of Minidoka is eligible for listing as a rural historic landscape on the National Register of Historic Places. See National Register Bulletin (NRB) 30: Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Rural Historic Landscapes.40 If this landscape is found eligible for the National Register, then BLM should submit a nomination to that effect to the Idaho SHPO in accordance with the Bureau’s affirmative responsibilities under Section 110 of the NHPA."

In March 2021, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) researchers released a scientific report that provides one of the most comprehensive population trend modeling efforts ever undertaken for the species19. The report describes an overall decline in the number of sage-grouse across the majority of their range, something previous studies have shown as well. Since 1965, sage-grouse populations have declined 80.7% range-wide (~3% decline per year), including areas where the decline has not been as severe. Since 2002, range-wide populations have declined 37%. Furthermore, 78% of leks have a greater than 50% probability of extirpation in the next 56 years. 

Idaho is no exception in exhibiting declining grouse populations. The state continues to have declining trajectory from peak counts in 2016, with 2019 appearing to be a nadir and stronger declines occurring north of the Snake River20.   

Figure 1. The average number of male Greater Sage-grouse counted on Idaho breekd-ground leks, reported on an annual basis 1996-2021. (Idaho Department of Fish and Game) 
Range-wide sage-grouse population declines should be taken in consideration with the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies-led ‘Sagebrush Conservation Strategy – Challenges to Sagebrush Conservation.’ This document provides a thorough and credible overview and assessment of the challenges facing land managers and landowners in conserving sagebrush ecosystems21.  Thus extra caution should be taken in the management of their sagebrush habitat, as habitat quality and quantity directly influence grouse populations. 

The collective influence of human activity on the landscape has been associated with negative trends in sage-grouse lek counts and population persistence22. Research has been conducted on impacts to sage-grouse from oil and gas development, but less information is available about the effects of renewable energy development  on sage-grouse. Infrastructure associated with energy development requires direct removal of vegetation and could result in direct impacts associated with vehicle traffic, human activity, and noise pollution that would continue for the life of the project23.  

Buffers between project developments and sage-grouse leks and key habitats are the best way to prevent impacts from occurring, and are well supported by peer-reviewed science. The relative probability of Greater Sage-grouse selecting brood-rearing and summer habitats decreased as percentage of surface disturbance associated with wind facility infrastructure increased24. Furthermore, researchers found that sage-grouse nest and brood failures increased with proximity to wind-energy infrastructure – specifically a linear decline of 7.1% in nest failure and 38% in brood failure with each 1-km (0.6-mi) increase in distance from wind energy infrastructure25. 

Studies suggest that an 8-km (5-mi) protection area centered on an active lek location should encompass the seasonal movements and habitat use of 90-95 percent of sage-grouse associated with the lek 26. Sage-grouse female survival did not vary in relation to wind-energy infrastructure though lek counts were not affected until 3-years post-development27. At that point, counts decreased by 56% at leks near (<1.5 km; 0.9 mi) the wind farm compared to those farther away (>1.5 km; 0.9 mi)28. Such lag effects have also been observed in response to oil and gas development, where declines were not observed until 4 years after construction29.  

Figure 2. Greater Sage-grouse leks and habitat designations, predicted Golden Eagle nest densities, and land ownership in relation to proposed Lava Ridge wind project area.  

Closer examination of Appendix 4 of the USGS report suggests there are a handful of leks within 10 miles of the proposed project area, including several within the boundary30. Based on this report, Figure 2 was created to illustrate the approximate lek locations in relation to the project boundary. This figure also reflects designated grouse habitat types on public lands in the general area. Finally, of relevance to later discussion, it shows predicted high and very high Golden Eagle nest densities31 and Audubon’s designated Important Bird Areas32. "
"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","III. The EIS must analyze impacts to raptors, notably Ferruginous Hawks and Golden Eagles. Siting should endeavor to avoid areas near nests and key areas of attraction.

Golden Eagles and Ferruginous Hawks are both listed as Species of Greatest Conservation Need in the Idaho State Wildlife Action Plan, Tier 2 category – meaning they are species with longer-term vulnerabilities or patterns suggesting management intervention is needed34. In addition, Golden Eagles are federally protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Act (BGEPA), which endeavors to achieve and maintain stable or increasing breeding populations of bald and golden eagles. BGEPA prohibits the take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald or golden eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest, or egg, unless allowed by permit(16 U.S.C. 668(a); 50 CFR 22). ""Take"" includes pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb (16 U.S.C. 668c; 50 CFR 22.3). 

The above should be taken into consideration because both species are a large-ranging avian predators of conservation concern throughout their North American range. Not only are both species in decline, but there is increasing concern due to current and future projections of mortality risk and habitat loss from anthropogenic sources. Among these human-caused sources is collision with wind turbines. In a recent USGS and Oklahoma State University study, 14 raptors were evaluated to determine how they were impacted by collisions with wind turbines35. Of the five with the highest potential for population-level impacts were Golden Eagle and Ferruginous Hawks. 

Wind development projects can displace raptors from otherwise suitable habitat, and are a significant source of mortality when placed in areas with high raptor concentrations36. Risk increases when paired with some fitness benefit to the individual - such proximity to food resources, roosting, and nest sites. This level of mortality is of particular concern for long-lived vertebrates, such as hawks and eagles, because even a relatively minor increase in adult mortality (3-5%) can lead to significant population declines37. 

While our organizations look forward to reviewing the avian surveys and associated analyses in the Draft EIS, we do caution that initial review of eBird predicts medium-high median annual abundance for both Golden Eagles and Ferruginous Hawks in the area. In addition, using nest site models developed by Dunk et al. (2019)38, which have direct application to perform risk analyses for wind projects, there is a high golden eagle predicted nest density in the project area and surrounding areas - see Figure 2. 

The BLM and MVE should proactively identify high risk areas, taking into account topography, and keep turbines and associated infrastructure away from these. Analyses for these far-ranging avian predators should extend beyond the project boundary, and take into account high risk areas in adjacent areas - as these could potentially bring these birds into conflict with turbines. These are key ways to minimize hawk and eagle mortality and displacement. Work in Wyoming, by researchers Tack and Fedy (2015)39 may serve as a valuable model to replicate, as would resources developed by the American Wind Wildlife Institute40. And finally, a report was prepared by Olendorff et al. (1989) and published by the Raptor Research Foundation41. This report, Raptor Habitat Management Under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management Multiple-Use Mandate, describes 223 Key Raptor Areas - areas with unusually high nesting populations, contain important raptor migration points, or where wintering raptors congregate. While dated many raptors continue to use historic nesting/congregation points. This report should be reviewed to determine if there's an overlap of the proposed project (or surrounding area) with KRA #87 and take this information into account to avoid impacts.

"REC03","3 - Hunting & Fishing","REC","Recreation and Visitor Services","These public lands are tremendously important for Idaho sportsmen/women and recreational enthusiasts, as well as our diverse wildlife. Our organizations are concerned that the proposed project may cause a loss of quality outdoor experiences and opportunity for sportsmen/women in Idaho, both directly and indirectly. The project area lies within IDFG Game Management Unit 
(GMU) 53, where hunters have the opportunity to pursue game with short-range weapons as well as a unique, long archery season from August 30-December 19. Additionally, up to 120 tags have been permitted in IDFG’s Zone 4B for hunters and falconers to pursue sage-grouse. This landscape offers a substantial amount of big game as well as upland bird and game hunting opportunity close to the Magic Valley region.  

GMU 53 encompasses 1,176,418 acres, with BLM-managed land totaling 329,397 acres, or 28% of the total acreage. 64% of the land within the GMU lies under private ownership, and over half of the unit is irrigated farmland. The Lava Ridge Wind Project is proposed to have a footprint over 73,000 acres on an extensive tract of BLM-managed land, with up to 400 wind turbines and 381 miles of access roads constructed. This level of disturbance over the total footprint of the project is significant and may wipe out 22% of the total huntable BLM-lands within GMU 53.

Given the significant road network proposed with the project, the BLM must consider the compounding effects of pioneered roads and trails from user-created and off highway vehicle 
(OHV) use stemming off of the 381-mile road network. Route densities can be an indicator of recreation-induced big game disturbance, displacement, and habitat loss causing adverse population-level impacts. Increased route densities will decrease habitat effectiveness (due to fragmentation, introduction of invasive annual grasses, etc.) and shrink available security habitat and, essentially, is a form of habitat loss for big game species. Increased pressure and disturbance from human activity on big game species will inevitably lead to a reduction in hunter opportunity. Given the absence of a travel management plan for the BLM-lands in focus, we are concerned that the road network and user-created routes from the road network will only increase these disturbances, permanently displace wildlife species, and reduce hunter opportunity in the future.  

A loss in functional habitat for ungulates on BLM-managed land will also cause unavoidable conflicts with private landowners and agricultural producers. GMU 53 cannot support many deer without unacceptable conflicts with agriculture, with depredation complaints already common50. IDFG has documented more than 3,000 mule deer moving into GMU 53 during the harsh winter of 1985-1986, resulting in 54 depredation complaints. The Department has also documented a substantial number of deer-vehicle collisions when mule deer move down into GMU 53 to escape harsh winter years.  "
"CUL01","1 - General Cultural Resources","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","Proposed Project Area Impacts – On Site

•	Based on our experiences with reconnaissance level surveys, we know how valuable undisturbed surface artifacts are in documenting and interpreting a site.  The Lava Ridge project would require extensive excavation in creating roads, wind turbine pads, transmission line supports, equipment pathways, substations, and storage buildings.  Such wide-spread disturbances of the surface would literally destroy surface and sub-surface artifacts and any cultural features associated with them.  The context of the story within a site would be completely lost and could never be recovered.

•	The unique volcanic formations within the proposed project area would be threatened by the placement of turbines and associated construction activities.  Among the volcanic features endangered are the pressure ridges and lava tube caves.   Evidence indicates that both features were highly utilized by Native Americans over thousands of years and by Euro-American settlers / travelers/emigrants within the last 170 years.  These natural formations provided observation points and shelter, besides serving as landmarks.  Petroglyph Cave, Black Ridge Butte and Cave,  Wilson Butte or Rocky Ridge, and Wilson Butte Cave are a few of the significant sites, with Wilson Butte Cave being one of the most significant Native American sites in North America.  To the east, the elevation of Wilson Butte (Rocky Ridge) itself provides an amazing view of the region in all directions.  Constructing wind turbines, roads, etc., in or near any of these sites mentioned would destroy the geologic landscape and cultural resources associated with use of those landscape features.  With a record of human occupation in this planned project area that stretches back 15,000 years, everything possible should be done to protect the area and its story from destructive construction undertakings.  Extensive projects like wind farms should not be allowed on wide open lands rich in cultural and natural resources."
"VIS01","1 - General","VIS","Visual Resources"," Views from scenic and historic byways in southern Idaho would be altered by the wind farm.  These specially designated routes, traveled by many tourists throughout the year, include the Peaks to Craters Scenic Byway from Arco to Highway 93 west of Carey, the Sawtooth Scenic Byway just north of Shoshone, the Thousand Springs Scenic Byway from Burley to Bliss, the Oregon Trail Auto Route along Interstate 84 from the Bliss area east to Raft River, and the Goodale Cutoff Auto Route from east of the Craters of the Moon to Fairfield.   The scenic byways showcase the natural beauty of an area, while the auto tour routes generally follow historic trails, such as the Oregon Trail or its alternate routes.   Views of the immense wind farm would certainly detract from the intent of the special designations, whether it be scenic or historic.

Also, disruptions to traffic along Highway 93 leading to the Sawtooth Scenic Byway need to be considered.  High traffic volume from the hundreds of workers and construction equipment going to and from the site would add to an already busy highway of tourists, recreationists, and commuters driving to and from the Hailey-Ketchum area.  Dust resulting from the construction may cause visibility problems on both the Sawtooth, the Peaks to Craters Scenic Byways, and the Goodale Cutoff Auto Route.  It would also be noticeable from Interstate 84 and other major roadways in Twin Falls County and could obscure the very views tourists and others want to enjoy.
View from the Twin Falls Visitor Center to the northeast toward the planned project area
•	Creating visual simulations of Key Observation Points (KOP) is critical in getting a full understanding of the impacts on viewscapes. In Twin Falls County, KOPs could be made from several of the current or future NRHP sites like the Stricker-Rock Creek Station south of Hansen, the Milner Dam east of Murtaugh, and the Evel Knievel Jump Site on the Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls (possible NRHP eligibility in 2024).  Walking trails, restaurants, and the Visitor Center along the south rim of the Snake River Canyon near the Perrine Bridge might also be considered for a visual simulation since the views are such an important feature in attracting use of the trails or businesses.    

Outside of Twin Falls County, KOPs could include simulations from the Minidoka National Historic Site near Eden, the Peaks to Craters Scenic Byway at and east/west of Craters of the Moon, Wilson Butte Cave northwest of Eden, and the communities of Richfield, Shoshone, and Dietrich.

"ALT02","2 - Suggested New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","The National Environmental Policy Act requires the BLM to consider alternatives outside of their jurisdiction to project proposals such as Lava Ridge’s.  Possible alternatives include,
•	Distributed generation (DG) – According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “distributed generation refers to a variety of technologies that generate electricity at or near where it will be used.”  DG can provide for individual homes or businesses, or it can be set up as part of a microgrid, “a smaller grid that is also tied into the larger electricity delivery system,” like that from a military base or large industrial complex.  Residences can generate power using rooftop solar panels, small wind turbines, and back-up generators.   Large businesses, industries, etc. may opt for combined energy generation from solar, wind, hydropower, solid waste incineration, and back-up generators for emergencies.  According to a report in Energy.gov, “Los Angeles alone has the rooftop potential for 9,000 MW of solar.”             
                   
DG has been successfully implemented in European nations like Spain and Germany and is now becoming more accepted in the United States as a more cost-effective means of using renewable technologies.  A big plus is energy does not have to be exported from a remote source, i.e., Idaho sending power to California, and there would be no need for Idaho to lose its open spaces to the construction of a massive wind farm.  Too, local control over power generation may be much better than relying on an energy project hundreds of miles away.  DG would certainly eliminate the impacts on the viewsheds, cultural and natural resources, and desert environment that a remote project like Lava Ridge would bring. 

 Also, Lava Ridge has a thirty-year lease for its wind farm.   As quickly as the wind energy technologies change and improve, it seems it would be easier for local centers to modify wind turbines than it would be for Lava Ridge with its 400 mammoth turbines.

A BLM employee responded that NEPA regulations had changed, and BLM would use the current regulation. We are concerned this may mean that BLM intends to use the 2020 Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations to prepare the Project’s EIS. CEQ’s 2020 NEPA regulations omit previous requirements for indirect and cumulative impacts analysis. However, on October 7, 2021, CEQ published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which stated that it will be revising the 2020 NEPA regulations and that CEQ proposes to restore the prior definitions of effects analysis and reinstate analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts (CEQ 2021b at 55762-55769).

"SOIL01","1 - General","SOIL","Soils and Geology","Soil loss is of particular concern with this Project because of its soil type. In some portions of the site, pervasive pediciling around bluebunch bunchgrasses and other vegetation, indicates erosion and soil loss from cattle activity. Over time, trampling and concentrated hoof action have disturbed soils in some portions of the Project area and made them vulnerable to wind erosion. These areas still provide wildlife habitat, but the Project’s construction activity will undoubtedly lead to further soil loss, due to the loamy soils. The inevitable disturbance and accompanying soil loss associated with the Project’s construction activities will be additive to the historic and current soil loss directly attributable to livestock activity. If the massive footprint of the wind project is approved, it would be prudent to address and ameliorate as much of the root causes of future soil loss as possible because soil loss on the arid project site is an irretrievable resource in human time. Therefore, as a partial mitigation measure for the Project, we suggest reducing the other major factor contributing to soil loss. This can be done if there are willing sellers and a permanent grazing permit retirement process. Willing seller programs provide economic resources that can be immediately applied to local economies and help livestock producers and their families apply buyout funds to other local enterprises. In order to ensure soil protection and even soil development over geologic time, allotment buyouts and retirements need to be permanent. Appropriate language in the Lava Ridge EIS and Record of Decision would ensure the integrity and permanancy of this multiple use application."

"NOI01","1 - General","NOI","Noise","Windfarms can be detrimental to the health of wildlife, livestock, and people who live nearby. In 2013 a study was conducted by doctors Michael A Nissenbaum, Jeffery J Aramini, and Christopher D Hanning. The findings and conditions of this study were published in the scientific journal Noise and Health. This was an in-depth study that had multiple study groups. The final results of the study concluded that: 

""This study supports the conclusions of previous studies, which demonstrate a relationship between proximity to IWTs and the general adverse effect of 'annoyance', but differs in demonstrating clear dose-response relationships in important clinical indicators of health including sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and mental health. The levels of sleep disruption and the daytime consequences of increased sleepiness, together with the impairment of mental health and the dose-response relationships observed in this study (distance from IWT vs. effect) strongly suggest that the noise from IWTs results in similar health impacts as other causes of excessive environmental noise. 

The degree of effect on sleep and health from IWT noise seems to be greater than that of other sources of environmental noise, such as, road, rail, and aircraft noise. Bray and James have argued that the commonly used noise metric of LAeq (averaged noise level adjusted to human hearing) is not appropriate for IWT noise, which contains relatively high levels of low frequency sound (LFN) and infrasound with impulsive characteristics. (14] This has led to an underestimation of the potential for adverse health effects of IWTs."" (Hanning et al., 2012) 

From these results we learn that the noise caused by IWTs (Industrial Wind Turbines) have been underestimated due to the inappropriate use of noise monitoring equipment. Because of this ineffective way of measuring the level of sound that the IWTs make, the health effects have been grossly understated. This ""annoyance"" is far more than just a mere inconvenience.

The proposed Lava Ridge Wind Project puts decades of livestock grazing at risk as well as dairy operations in the area. In a paper titled ""SUMMARY OF RECENT RESEARCH ON ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIND TURBINES"" by Keith Stelling, we learn that 

""There is growing evidence that animals are affected even more severely than humans by the low frequency noise and vibrations from industrial wind turbines."" 

""Laboratory studies upon animals have been reviewed with quite chilling results, as it clear that deformities, damage and impairment occur to the subjects with regularity. Admittedly the animals were contained and subjected to exposure times of several hours per day at moderate to high intensity levels of LFN and infrasound. Yet fish and aquatic creatures contained in ponds and lakes would certainly be unable to escape whatever the level of sound intensity or duration of exposure"". 

Buxton cites as examples of the effect of noise on animals: the reduction of egg laying by domestic poultry; injury and loss involving livestock; goats with reduced milk production; pigs with excessive hormonal secretion as well as water and sodium retention; sheep and lambs with increased heart rates, respiratory changes and reduction in feeding. ""There is clearly a cause for concern because of the likely effects upon wildlife and current protective measures seem inadequate""."" (Stelling & Phyt, 2009) 

Keith Stelling goes in his article to cite the experience of a farmer who lived near an industrial wind farm. 

""Awareness of the research cited by Buxton (above) indicating endocrine and cardiovascular effects from noise would certainly support the symptoms observed by Ontario farmer Ross Brindley who lives near the Kingsbridge wind turbine development near Goderich. According to a report in the December 2008 Better Farming Magazine, his cattle exhibited aggressive and erratic behaviour, ""including the kicking of newborn calves, prolapsed birthing, weight loss, decline in fertility, a high incidence of mastitis, calves being deformed at birth and a high incidence of stillbirths."" After being driven out of business as a result of problems suffered by his beef cattle herd, Brindley is suing Hydro One Networks Inc. and Edmonton Power Corporation (EPCOR)."" 

""In the same context, the BBC recently reported that 400 goats in Taiwan had died after eight wind turbines were installed close to their grazing land. ""The goats looked skinny and they weren't eating. One night I went out and the goats were all standing up; they weren't sleeping"", the farmer reported. The Council of Agriculture suspects that noise may have caused the goats' demise through lack of sleep."" (Stelling & Phyt, 2009) 

On another website (wind-watch.erg) we learn even more stories of mass death and sickness in animals that live near windfarms 

""In an article titled Are Wind Turbines Killing Innocent Goats? Discovery Magazine reported that a Taiwanese farmer blames the death of 400 goats on a nearby wind facility. His claim is backed up by a local livestock inspector who said unusual sounds can impact animals' appetite, growth and sleep. The farmer has stated that the goats had been unable to sleep and began losing weight prior to their deaths."" 

""In Wisconsin, a farmer who tells his story on YouTube describes losing 19 cattle that died or had to be put down because they were ""pretty much lifeless."" In addition, 30 calves have died. The farm is within a mile of a wind facility. One cow removed from the site and moved elsewhere later recovered, the farmer stated."" 

""Dr. Nina Pierpont, author of Wind Turbine Syndrome, interviewed a horse breeder who lost six of eight babies after wind turbines were erected nearby his breeding mares. Some aborted early, others had no milk and others didn't conceive. 

""I've been in the horse business for 45 years,"" the rancher said. ""I don't know whether there's dirty electricity in the ground, I don't if they keep them from sleeping ... but there's something."" "

"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","Keith Stelling stated in ""SUMMARY OF RECENT RESEARCH ON ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIND TURBINES"" that 

""It appears that animals are even more susceptible to low frequency noise than humans. The animal kingdom relies upon a wide range of sound frequencies inaudible to humans. It has to be remembered that within these sensitive habitats where almost no background noise is experienced, the low frequency noise and vibration projected (and transmitted through the earth) by industrial wind turbine operation is most certainly threatening or confusing to wildlife. The hearing and vibration sensitivity of most creatures in the wild is far more acute than human sound perception. 

Confusion by sound emanations can lead to the failure of hunting success, self defense and ultimately survival. Snakes, for example, which rely extensively upon their perception of vibration, are particularly sensitive to habitat disturbance from industrial developments. The noise pollution at higher frequencies may explain the catastrophic effect wind turbines are having on bats, a significant keystone species within the balance of nature. Permeating a large area of natural habitat with extraneous noise pollution will have obvious repercussions for the survival of species dependent on the special characteristics of these unique refuges and, as has been observed by biologists, lead to permanent abandonment.""

Road construction and use associated with transmission line maintenance represent high risk for loss of lek areas, nesting locations, and brood-rearing habitats (Braun 1986, Connelly et al. 2004).  In addition, sage-grouse have been shown to avoid transmission lines, presumably because of potential predation. Ellis (1985) found a 72% decline in the average of males on leks and a 65% increase in predation efforts involving raptors following the construction of a transmission line within 200 m of an active sage-grouse lek in northeastern Utah.  Sage-grouse lek attendance dropped significantly following power line construction within 3 miles of leks in California.  In a comprehensive study of ecological requirements, sage-grouse were extirpated in areas where power line densities were above 0.20 km/km2 and sage-grouse habitat was ranked highest where power lines were less than 0.06 km/km2.

"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","Regarding the spatial scale of proposed management activity effects on sage-grouse and habitat, the BLM should recognize that sage-grouse can require movements of tens of miles between required habitats.  Thus, a significant challenge in managing and conserving sage-grouse populations is the fact that they depend upon different types of habitat for each stage of their annual cycle (Connelly et al. 2009), and upon the ability to move between the different habitats throughout the year.  Each seasonal habitat must provide the necessary protection from predators, required food resources, and thermal needs for the specific stage of the annual cycle.  Breeding-related events and season habitat needs are described below:
1)	Late brood-rearing period in July through September.  Late brood-rearing is focused in wetter areas, especially riparian and spring-associated meadows closely associated with nearby sagebrush.
2)	Movement to winter habitat.
3)	Occupation of winter habitat from November through February.  The primary requirement of winter habitat is sagebrush exposure above the snow, and is generally characterized by dense sagebrush, often including areas of wind-swept ridges.
4)	Lekking, which may begin as early as late February, and may extend into May.  Lekking requires open expanses of sagebrush within a large area of sagebrush cover.  Lek persistence has been affected by disturbance activities within 3.1, 11.2, and 33.5 mile radii (Swenson et al. 1987, Johnson et al. 2009, Knick and Hanser 2009).
5)	Female movement to nesting sites and nesting between March and June.  Nesting females commonly move 3-5 miles or farther from the lekking site.  Females select areas with more sagebrush canopy than is generally available in the surrounding landscape (Holloran et al 2005, Hagen et al. 2007) 
6)	Hatching and early brood-rearing in May and June.  Females continue to use relatively dense stands of sagebrush for earliest brood-rearing habitat if native forbs and insects are available.  When vegetation desiccates, females and broods move to wetter areas in search of the native forbs and insects required by chicks.

Given the considerations of year-round habitat use and known impacts of human activity on sage-grouse populations, particular care needs to be taken to avoid disturbance near lekking areas, disturbance and loss of sagebrush and native forbs used for early brood-rearing, and disturbance and impacts to hydrologic function of wet areas used for early to late brood-rearing. 

"
"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","After avoidance, the next step is for the BLM to develop design features to ensure that any side effects or minor impacts are minimized. With regard to activities with the potential to disturb sage-grouse, the Conservation Plan offers this recommendation:

Apply seasonal-use restrictions (see Human Disturbance Section 4.3.5) on activities associated with the exploration, operations, and maintenance of mines, gravel pits, or landfills, including those associated with supporting infrastructure.
-Conservation Plan for the Greater Sage-grouse in Idaho, p. 4-126

Mitigation
If the BLM and Magic Valley Energy/LS Power successfully avoid and minimize impacts to sage-grouse there will still be an array of indirect effects to sage-grouse. The USFWS determined that transmission lines and energy infrastructure may cause a host of adverse indirect effects to sage-grouse, including increased predation, lower recruitment rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation from invasive species, and impacts from electromagnetic fields.  

FLMPA requires the BLM to, “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands,” (43 U.S.C. 1732 (b)) (emphasis added).  This directive clearly provides the BLM with the authority to require operators or individuals proposing to impact Sage-grouse Priority, Important Habitat or General Habitat Management Areas to participate in a Compensatory Mitigation program that restores or enhances degraded habitat in off-site locations within the affected resource planning area.

As such, the next step is to develop off-site mitigation for any remaining impacts:

Off-site mitigation should be employed to offset unavoidable alteration and losses of sage-grouse habitat. Off-site mitigation should focus on acquiring, restoring, or improving habitat within or adjacent to occupied habitats and ideally should be designed to complement local sage-grouse conservation priorities.
-Conservation Plan for the Greater Sage-grouse in Idaho, p. 4-126

A key component of the Governor’s Sage-Grouse Conservation Plan is the use of a Mitigation Framework developed by the State Sage-Grouse Advisory Committee and references in the 2015 Greater Sage-grouse Amended Resource Management Plans for Idaho and Southwest Montana. The mitigation framework requires the quantification of both direct and indirect impacts. A Habitat Equivalency Analysis tool can be helpful in determining the the quality of the habitat adjacent to the project, the topography of that habitat, the impacts to that habitat and to sage-grouse, and the specific use of that habitat by sage-grouse (lekking, nesting and brood rearing, etc). 

Depending on the nature and degree of these impacts, mitigation measures may be more successful in off-site high-priority restoration areas with a higher likelihood of full benefits to sage-grouse. The State’s Mitigation Technical Team can assist with locating suitable sites and types of projects. Mitigation projects need to persist for the duration of the impacts, take into account any lag time between the beginning of impacts and the accrual of benefits, factor in the success rate of vegetation restoration efforts, likelihood of habitat restoration failures or loss due to drought, and rate of habitat loss due to wildfires.

"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","The Lava Ridge project should be designed to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts on raptors either from turbine operations or from accidental electrocution. We appreciate steps that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power has already taken to avoid a golden eagle nest at Crater Butte and a ferruginous hawk nest east of Star Lake. 

To avoid additional negative effects, turbines and turbine strings should be located outside of major flyways or high use areas by eagles as identified in the NEPA process. Transmission lines should be designed to avoid electrocuting birds of prey. To minimize negative effects, we support the use of radar detection technology, such as the MERLIN Avian Radar System, to turn off the turbines when birds are approaching. We also recommend coordinating with the Intermountain Bird Observatory and building into the system the ability to turn the turbines off for the key nights during the spring and fall migrations. The exact dates of these events will change every year and be related to bird migration timing for that year and weather conditions, but Magic Valley Energy/LS Power can work with IBO and other partners to identify these key nights in advance. 

To mitigate effects, Magic Valley Energy/LS Power should examine ways to improve habitat for eagles, raptors and migratory birds a sufficient distance from the project area. One potential design feature is to construct artificial platforms for ferruginous hawks and golden eagles in areas where nesting habitat is limited due to lack of cliffs or other structures. Mitigating for effects on raptor populations in offsite locations could also involve enhancing raptor prey populations, and prey populations are best enhanced by managing their habitat. Jackrabbits require shrubs for food and cover; ground squirrels thrive best in vegetation communities dominated by native perennial shrubs and grasses. We also recommend monitoring trends in small mammal populations that are key prey species (ground squirrels and jack rabbits) on a landscape level.  The monitoring of small mammals should be coordinated with raptor monitoring.

"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","Bats have been found to be particularly susceptible to death by wind turbines, including collision with turbine towers and rotating blades, as well as barotrauma, which is fatal internal bleeding due to the changes in air pressure. Review studies have found a positive relationship between turbine height and bat fatality, which is of major concern with such tall turbines proposed at the Lava Ridge project.  However, studies do show that the aviation lighting on wind turbines may result in fewer bat fatalities. We believe that exploring the use of radar detection technology, such as the MERLIN Avian Radar System, to turn on the night time turbine lights when bats approach is necessary for this project. Furthermore, the ability to turn off the turbine blades as bats approach could decrease the chance of bat-turbine collisions."
"WILD02","2 - Big Game ","WILD","General Wildlife","Based on the study’s preliminary findings, it appears that there is a north-south big game corridor in the project area. We understand that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power has some degree of flexibility regarding the location of individual turbines and wind strings. As an avoidance measure, we recommend developing an alternative that relocates the turbines within this wildlife corridor to another string. The exact distance or buffer from the remaining turbines to the wildlife core area and corridor should be based on the best available science. 

In 2017, Sawyer et al. found that mule deer will avoid energy infrastructure for at least 15 years post-construction.  This long-term impact to behavior could have major implications for mitigation and management of this game species in the study area. The results of Sawyer and others emphasize the importance of proper data collection for how this area is used by these species.

Taylor et al. 2015 found that winter survival of pronghorn was not was influenced by exposure to small-scale wind infrastructure near Dunlap Ranch in Wyoming;  however, Sawyer et al. 2019 found that long-term pronghorn response to industrial-scale energy development can involve both avoidance of infrastructure and partial abandonment of traditional winter ranges. 
"
"WILD02","2 - Big Game ","WILD","General Wildlife","Regarding pronghorn and mule deer mitigation, there are several significant migratory corridors in the region such as between Craters of the Moon and the mountain valleys.  Some of these have geographic pinch points made more problematic by fences that do not allow for easy wildlife passage. Here is a relevant summary of the pronghorn migration from Craters of the Moon National Monument: 

This migration extends over one hundred miles each way from the Pioneer Mountains to the Birch Creek area of the Upper Snake River Plain. The migration route parallels Highway 20/26/93 for most of the stretch between the towns of Carey and Arco. It passes through a narrow corridor in places only a few hundred yards wide between the Craters of the Moon lava fields and the foothills of the Pioneer Mountains. Many more modern obstacles have appeared within the migration corridor over the past century. Fences and highways both present real challenges and dangers to pronghorn attempting to cross them. For all their athletic speed, pronghorn do not like to jump. When encountering a barbed wire fence they attempt to crawl underneath rather than going over. Some fences with wire too close to the ground prevent this option and pronghorn must search for a way around. Fences along highways present particular danger to pronghorn attempting to cross roads along the migration corridor. They are often either struck by vehicles or run head long into barb wire when panicked by oncoming traffic.

The National Park Service, along with many other public land agencies and private land owners, are working to reduce fencing hazards by either removing fencing all together or modifying existing fencing to facilitate pronghorn passage. You can help by driving carefully in areas marked as wildlife crossings to reduce wildlife collisions. Slowing down in these zones greatly reduces the risk to wildlife and to you.

Much of what is known about the pronghorn migration corridor across Craters of the Moon has only been learned in recent years. Development of new technologies has allowed continuous tracking of pronghorn for a full year. GPS devices with a radio transmitter have been attached to captured pronghorn. After a year the devices are programmed to fall off and can then be located using the radio transmitters. The recorded locations from the GPS device are downloaded to reveal an almost hour-by-hour record of their movements. A number of organizations led by the Lava Lake Institute for Science and Conservation and the Wildlife Conservation Society made this study possible.

We recommend that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power help support these adjacent research efforts. We also recommend that Magic Valley Energy/LS Power develop a pronghorn mitigation program focused on identifying and prioritizing these pinch points and work with willing landowners and permittees to modify, upgrade, replace or remove fences of concern.

Wildlife monitoring and evaluation should include assessments of individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems.  The monitoring and evaluation plan should include objectives for wildlife and habitat health, a schedule for monitoring and reporting, parameters to measure whether the impacts are within the range of the environmental analysis. We also recommend developing population and habitat triggers for key wildlife species and a set of predetermined actions if triggers are tripped.

The interstate pavement is designed for a very high number of heavy vehicles; while the local county roads are designed for a very low number of farm to market vehicles. To head off acceleration of pavement distress and reduced pavement life it is necessary to apply preventive maintenance measures such as bituminous plantmix overlays or replacement of plant mix surfaces. Allowing pavements to fail in distress results in costly rehabilitation or reconstruction. The costs of these treatments are usually borne by the local highway districts or state. Performing preventative maintenance is a far more efficient use of public funds than reconstruction. ITD programs preventative maintenance projects on pavements for this reason. "

When asked about wildfire prevention and suppression, at the April 24th information session at the

district, and an active member of the Notch Butte Rangeland Fire Protection Association, I was 
concerned about the applicant’s lack of knowledge and their proposed mitigation of wildfire risks both 
during the construction and operation phase of the project.
On April 24th, a representative of the applicant referenced that the network of roads to be constructed 
as part of the project, including many that would be 16 feet wide, would provide a “natural firebreak”. 
Unfortunately, in the case of wind driven fires resulting from thunderstorm outflow winds or passage of 
cold fronts, a 16-foot-wide road often is insufficient to stop an advancing fire front, even in the grass 
fuel types present throughout much of the project area. Our experience living here is that these sorts of 
fires jump two-lane highways and that such fires require aerial firefighting resources to lay retardant 
lines that herd the fire away from sensitive resources or infrastructure. These fires may only stop when 
they burn into green agricultural land. Considering that the presence of the 700 ft plus tall towers rules 
out the use of aerial firefighting resources, the applicant should harden their infrastructure against 
damage from wildfire, and should take aggressive and thorough steps to prevent ignition during all 
phases of construction and operation of the project. Furthermore, they must take action to mitigate the

In my professional opinion, these towers will diminish the cultural landscape and overall visitor experience at Minidoka.

I've known for many years about the incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII but I've only learned more recently about the extent of the damage that experience caused to so many good Americans.  I have two friends who were interred in two of the camps, one at Minidoka, and I've learned from them more than I ever realized about the devastation that experience caused to families who never deserved such outrageous treatment, and even to those who came after.  I've also come to understand the role the Minidoka Site plays in the healing process for those families.
                          
I understand the importance of renewable energy to the future of our country and our entire planet.  I support the development of wind farms in good locations.  And I know that finding and developing such locations is a difficult process.

As a child, I along with my entire family were forcibly removed from our home in the Seattle area and were dropped off in a remote and undeveloped location in Idaho.  While I was a young child when I was forcibly moved to Minidoka, I still remember the smell, sounds, and environment of Minidoka.  Many call this the power of place and it stirs in me memories of being scared, worried, and wondering why my family had to move to this rural and isolated location.

 

I thought that I would never ever return to a place that reminded me of so much heartache and pain.  But my son and grandson convinced me to return to participate in the annual pilgrimage sacred land to me and my family. That pilgrimage provided me and my family an opportunity to begin the healing process and begin the journey of understanding how my government treated us Americans as enemy aliens and fundamentally changed the course of so many lives.

 

Minidoka provided my family with a place to reflect, heal, and process the many intertwined and difficult feelings and emotions.  While I once considered Minidoka a cursed place, I now realize it should be protected as hallowed ground to remind the government and others that what was done to the 120,000+ people of Japanese descent can never be repeated.

 

That is why it was so disappointing to hear that an energy company was investigating the idea of installing 400 windmills in and around Minidoka, forever changing the nature of the sacred site, ruining Minidokas viewshed, and once again disrespecting those who were illegally incarcerated there.

Both my maternal grandparents were incarcerated during World War II as small children. My grandmother was incarcerated with her mother and siblings at Minidoka and my grandfather was incarcerated at Tule Lake with his parents. I have had the privilege of attending the Minidoka pilgrimage hosted at the Minidoka National Historical Site twice. Both times I was deeply affected by visiting the actual site where my grandmother and her family were forcibly incarcerated. The isolation and remoteness of the site drove home that deep injustice that occurred there and gave me space to reflect. It was only possible to truly imagine my great-grandmother arriving to the high desert of Idaho from rainy Alaska with a baby and three children and no idea what the future holds was only possible by being at the site.


The environmental setting of Minidoka creates a space of solemnity and allows survivors of the concentration camps and descendents of survivors, such as myself, to reflect on the past and find healing. It is essential to maintain this solemnity to commemorate the survivors of the forced removal and unjust incarceration during World War II. A wind farm near the site would desecrate the site and visually and aurally disturb the solemnity of the site. 


Additionally, it is vitally important that all Americans know the full history of World War II, including the exclusion, forced removal and incarceration. It is a dark chapter in our history, and has had lasting effects beyond the War. Maintaining the site of Minidoka in its current state of solemnity and isolation allows visitors to contextualize the history in the place it occurred. 


Renewable energy is vital to having a sustainable future, however we must be thoughtful and intersectional in our considerations for how we implement it. The Lava Ridge Wind Farm project must be moved so as to not infringe on the solemnity of the Minidoka National Historical Site and maintain a reflective and educational space.

There you could look out across the baseball field into the barren, windy landscape and imagine boys playing baseball, running the bases, yelling and laughing.  Looking toward the barracks, the sounds of mothers washing clothes, preparing meals for their block unit, using latrines, men standing around in their worn-out coats, filled my mind. Tears came to my eyes because I finally got it. My heart ached for these people and the terrible hardships that they were forced to endure. I put my arm around Janet and told her how proud I was of her and the years of dedication she put in to keeping their memory alive. 
Having wind turbines whirling and casting shadows across the land would be disrespectful and devalue the sacrifices to all those who passed through those gates.

Both reports indicate the Project will be near SIRCOMM’s Dietrich Butte Site in Lincoln County, an area where SIRCOMM was granted a right-of-way by the BLM for the operation of a telecommunications tower in 1993. SIRCOMM also owns and/or operates several other telecommunication towers in the area not on property owned by the BLM. In particular, there is the Hansen Tower Site located in Twin Falls County and the Gooding Tower Site, located in Gooding County. Additionally, in order to enhance its coverage area to improve service for the public it serves, SIRCOMM is currently completing final steps to utilize the tower site located at Skeleton Butte, in Jerome County.  These tower sites are all interconnected.  

SIRCOMM remains deeply concerned that the proposals by MVA may interfere with the integrity of SIRCOMM’s operations in the region. While it is impossible at this early stage to completely identify all possible risks or problems the Project may cause for SIRCOMM, we once again identify and reiterate the following concerns:  

•	Interference with the radio transmission and reception pathways near Dietrich Butte.

•	Interference with the transmission and reception pathways between the Dietrich, Hansen, and Gooding Tower Sites. 

•	Interference with the transmission and reception pathways between Dietrich Butte and Skeleton Butte.

•	Interference with the transmission and reception pathways caused by the large equipment that will likely be utilized to construct the windmills proposed in the project. 

SIRCOMM recently completed a significant comprehensive project, at great expense, to improve the coverage of its telecommunication system based on the current conditions in the region. A project of the magnitude being proposed by MVE may place the future efficacy of this overhaul at risk. 

The statement below from the Commsearch report (Section 4-Recomendations, pg.8) cause us additional concern:

4. “Recommendations- In the event that a public safety entity believes its coverage has been compromised by the presence of the wind energy facility, it has many options to improve its signal coverage to the area through optimization of a nearby base station or even adding a repeater site. Utility towers, meteorological towers or even the turbine towers within the wind project area can serve as the platform for a base station or repeater site.”

            The realization that “coverage has been compromised” would likely occur in the construction phase of the Project. Once compromise has been realized, efforts to repair the compromise may not be swift enough to avoid the disruption of emergency services to that region, which could impact human life and safety.  The time and cost associated with “optimizing a nearby base station”, “adding a repeater site” to a “utility tower, meteorological tower or turbine tower”, can be lengthy, complex, and expensive. There also remains uncertainty as to the efficacy of these alternatives. And, if these things were required by the Project, SIRCOMM may not have the financial means to carry them out. It may therefore be appropriate to begin consideration and discussion about whether these potential costs should be part of overall Project expense.   

             Included as an attachment with this letter, is a simple diagram showing the microwave pathways SIRCOMM is primarily concerned about. The Dietrich site serves as a “back-up” microwave system to our Jerome tower site. Should our microwave system in Jerome malfunction, the Dietrich site would then serve as our primary microwave simulcast system. Interference from any wind turbine structures at that point could prove disastrous.

The Minidoka National Historic Site is where thousands of Oregon residents of Japanese ancestry were unjustly imprisoned during World War II, and the preservation of this historic site is important for all visitors to help us understand the chilling injustice, critical civil rights lessons, and to lift up the stories of the individuals forcibly removed and incarcerated there from 1942 to 1945.

"SOC03","3 - Environmental Justice","SOC","Socioeconomics","In essence, Minidoka NHS serves not only as a tangible reminder of a dark chapter in our nation’s history; it also serves as a public tribute to the Nikkei community’s survival, resilience, and accomplishments. The evidence is compelling that the Japanese Americans, who survived incarceration at the ten War Relocation Authority internment camps, and their descendants constitute a distinct “community with environmental justice concerns” related to the Lava Ridge Wind Project."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","The National Park Service (NPS) cites the cultural landscape of Minidoka in 1942 with an oral history excerpt, “When we first arrived here, we almost cried, and thought that this is the land God had forgotten. The vast expanse of nothing but sagebrush and dust, a landscape so alien to our eyes, and a desolate, woebegone feeling of being so far removed from home.” The silence and desolation of the landscape of a concentration camp is what will be removed by the proposed project. 

The cultural landscape is a critical part of Minidoka’s recognition as a national historic place representing significant civil liberties history in the United States (National Register Significance Criteria: A). It is an essential part of the history and the present-day setting, which is a place of continuing pilgrimage. The NPS explains, “It is defined by a rolling plain of high desert sagebrush steppe punctuated by basalt outcroppings…those landscape characteristics that contribute to the historic site include: natural systems, spatial organization, cluster arrangement, archeological resources, cultural traditions, circulation, buildings and structures, and vegetation.”  

The proximity, activity, and height of the proposed structures of the Lava Ridge Wind Project will obliterate the historic and cultural landscape of the Minidoka National Historic Site. This constitutes a significant environmental impact and an environmental injustice, layered over historical civil liberties injustice. These are places of conscience, meant to be remembered for their isolated environments. "
"PUBL03","3 - Public Outreach/Availability of Info","PUBL","Public and Stakeholder Involvement","Regarding adequate environmental assessment, the recommendation always is for the public to get involved as early as possible in the process and to ensure they have that opportunity. My experience is that the explanation later in the process will be that ""we did not analyze that because it was not identified during scoping.""  

Those associated with the history of Minidoka extend far beyond the notification provided for this project. That is part of the history of eventual migration caused by forced removal and incarceration, as many lost the entirety of their property and were unable to return to their former home. It also is a function of time over the past decades. 

As stated in my earlier public comment [September 8, 2021], there does not appear to have been a comprehensive effort to identify Japanese American or historical and descendant organizations to gain their participation early in the scoping phase. The public outreach appears to have been very localized, e.g. local media announcements. The only other notification was published in the Federal Register on August 20, 2021, for which there is no realistic and reasonable expectation that the public would see the notice in time to participate.

I also would call your attention to the fact there have been nationally restrictive circumstances which limit participation due to COVID.  As stated, the survivors and families of those incarcerated at Minidoka during WWII are scattered around the U.S. and many of the survivors are elderly, as are many descendants. Please do not move forward with a process that prevents them from being heard and from fully understanding the potential impacts. It would be another action that compounds the injustice of WWII incarceration and would not further the SO 3399 goal of transparency and integrity in the process. "

"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","ABC’s wind risk assessment map5 shows three areas of importance for birds in the vicinity of the project site: (1) the entirety of the site is mapped as an area of importance for eagles; (2) an intermountain raptor migration corridor is mapped in a generally northwest-southeast oriented band southwest of the proposed project site; and (3) a Greater Sage-grouse breeding stronghold is mapped to the northeast. 

The above indicates that planning for Lava Ridge Wind must take particular care to study and assess, then avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts to raptors and Greater Sage-grouse."
"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","As indicated above, the majority of the proposed Lava Ridge Wind project site is in general habitat for Greater Sage-grouse. We are dismayed that this massive area of grouse habitat, on public land, is being proposed for development. Given grouse population declines, ongoing range contraction, and prediction for long-term eradication from much of this species’ range, eliminating such a large block of habitat should not be an option. 

The sheer scale of the amount of grouse habitat that would be lost if the Lava Ridge Wind project is constructed as proposed demands that risk to this imperiled species be thoroughly evaluated and addressed.  

The Plan of Development (POD) for the proposed project indicates that the following will be conducted for Greater Sage-grouse: (1) Desktop-level impact assessment, (2) Ground checks of active and pending leks within the proposed project area, and (3) Aerial reconnaissance for leks within or in proximity to the proposed project site. 

This suite of surveys focuses only on leks, and thus neglects Greater Sage-grouse habitat use during the majority of the year. This is clearly inadequate. 

Recommendations 
1.	Significantly reduce or eliminate the inclusion of general grouse habitat in the plan, prioritizing preservation of the best habitat, known occupied areas, and areas contiguous with habitat off-site.
2.	If Greater Sage-grouse leks are discovered in the proposed project site, turbines and other infrastructure within 5 miles7 should be removed from the plan or relocated to avoid impacts.
3.	Aerial surveys or another scientifically-justified methodology should be conducted to identify Greater Sage-grouse wintering areas. Surveys should be conducted over multiple years.
4.	If Greater Sage-grouse wintering grounds are discovered in the proposed project site, turbines and other infrastructure should be relocated or removed from the plan in these areas and within an associated science-based buffer.
5.	Following revisions to the plan based on the points above, incorporate further revisions to allow for habitat, population, and genetic connectivity among preserved habitat areas and offsite habitat.
6.	Compensatory mitigation should be provided to a net conservation benefit for impacts to Greater Sage-grouse through on-the-ground conservation actions to offset losses. This should prioritize permanent protection of priority habitat to realize the greatest positive impact.

"WILD02","2 - Big Game ","WILD","General Wildlife","I. The EIS must document and analyze effects of the proposed project in its entirety on big game species, considering both construction and operation periods. The BLM must develop and consider alternatives that minimize or avoid negative impacts on these species.

Big game are culturally and economically important to Idaho’s citizens and communities. Ungulates such as pronghorn, mule deer, and elk travel great distances to reach favorable summer and winter ranges, often traveling upwards of 100 miles. Large, intact, and unfragmented habitats are required in order to successfully complete this wide range of movement and migration. The Lava Ridge project area overlays general and winter habitat for these species. Impacts to these species and the landscapes utilized by these species at critical times must be analyzed and made available for public comment/understanding during this review process, not only in regards to project construction but also during operation.  

Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the most influential factors affecting species distribution and population viability3. Worldwide, energy development projects are quickly converting native habitats into roads, well pads, pipelines, wind turbines, solar installations and other infrastructure associated with energy production4. Research assessing the impacts of energy development to ungulate populations has focused largely on impacts of oil and natural gas, which has found responses to include avoidance and altered movement patterns5.  

It remains largely unknown whether impacts to ungulates in general, and pronghorn in particular, associated with oil and gas development are comparable with other forms of development6. However, both wind energy and oil and gas development result in increased human activity during construction and production phases. Traditional energy generation and wind energy developments have similar infrastructure densities and direct habitat loss per unit area, yet the potential impacts to ungulate behavior in response to wind infrastructure remains unclear7.  

There also seems be a perception that ungulates adapt to altered landscapes and acclimate to energy infrastructure. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) assessments often assume displacement of ungulates is short term, and once the production phase is initiated, behavioral impacts attenuate or cease8. However, in one study in western Wyoming, mule deer did not habituate to disturbance and continued to avoid energy infrastructure after fifteen years of development9. In the study, mule deer abundance declined by 36% during the development period, despite aggressive onsite mitigation efforts and a 45% reduction in deer harvest. Similarly, studies of mule deer and elk in Oregon suggest that habitat selection and movements may be altered by roads, primarily because of the associated human activities10. Long-term avoidance behavior in historic winter range is problematic because indirect habitat loss reduces the size of winter range available for mule deer-habitat that would otherwise be used is functionally unavailable11. Important mule deer winter range includes areas that reduces the rate of energy loss by providing shallow snow, adequate food resources, security cover, and thermal environments12. Winter survival primarily depends on accumulating body reserves prior to winter and selecting landscapes that provide adequate forage and protection from weather and predators13. Winter range is often geographically restricted, so that habitat loss cannot be offset by simple range expansion. Thus, when habitat is lost directly through conversion to infrastructure and additionally through behavioral avoidance, carrying capacity is also reduced14. 

As interest in wind development has increased in sagebrush country, so has interest in understanding potential impacts to pronghorn. Taylor et al. (2016) found that proximity to a wind facility did not affect winter survival of pronghorn, but it did change patterns of space use by females15. This latter piece is important given that populations are driven by females and their ability to reproduce sufficient young at or above replacement levels. Thus, special consideration must be given when contemplating further development to landscapes used by pronghorn during winter as they are already predisposed to high mortality rates on winter range due to harsh environmental conditions and high energy demands16. Exposure to further disturbance during this already risky timeframe – such as being pushed to use of lower quality habitat - may impact survival and overall health of these populations17.  

The health of Southern Idaho’s ungulate herds relies on the conservation of sagebrush integrity and the connectivity to winter range. Secretarial Order 3362 Improving Habitat Quality in Western Big-Game Winter Range and Migration Corridors directs the Department of Interior, in partnership with the state of Idaho, to improve the quality of big-game winter range and migration corridor habitat.  

We encourage the BLM, in coordination with Idaho Department of Fish & Game (IDFG) to analyze wildlife movement and migrations that occur within and adjacent to the project area, and produce comprehensive maps on these findings to be included in the project record. If these findings indicate an overlap of the project area in functionally available winter range, alternatives that minimize impacts to these areas or avoid them altogether must be developed and considered. This information gap is necessary to close for a decision that minimizes impacts to our state’s cherished ungulate species and is supported by the best available science.  
"
"ALT01","1 - General Deficiency, Inadequate Range of Alts","ALT","Alternatives","Conversations with BLM staff  indicate the project will consider sage-grouse lek avoidance buffers (3.1-mile buffer from each active lek) established by the 2015 Greater Sage Grouse Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment. We encourage the BLM to develop and analyze alternatives with lek buffers ranging from of a minimum of 3.1 miles up to 5 miles from active leks to fully understand what is most effective to minimize disturbances across the landscape. Given the scale of the proposed project and the unknowns around long-term impacts of wind development on the species, we believe developing these alternatives is a careful and considerate approach.  

There have been several significant policy changes and/or reinstatement of previous policies that apply to the BLM projects since the release of the scoping document and open public comment period. Our organizations expect the BLM to integrate these policy changes into Lava Ridge’s NEPA process and develop alternatives that reflect these changes. Specifically, we look to the BLM to follow mitigation guidance set by Instruction Memorandum (IM) No. 2021-046 Reinstating the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Manual Section (MS-1794) and Handbook (H-1794-1) on Mitigation. The IM provides policies to:  
1)	Implement consistent principles and procedures for mitigation in the BLM’s authorization of public land uses;
2)	Apply mitigation to address reasonably foreseeable impacts to resources (and their values, services, and/or functions) from public land uses; and
3)	Follow the mitigation hierarchy by first avoiding damage to the public lands and resources; second, minimizing damage that cannot be avoided; and third, compensating for any residual impacts to important, scarce, or sensitive resources or resources protected by law.(Emphasis added)33

The IM directs the BLM to implement mitigation through a landscape-scale approach, utilize best management practices, maintain durability for mitigation measures, monitor mitigation measures for compliance and effectiveness, and adaptively manage mitigation measures. We encourage the BLM and MVE to engage with IDFG and the public to identify areas within the project where damage to public lands and resources (more specifically, sage-grouse, big game habitat) can be avoided and/or minimized. If determined to be unavoidable, we expect the BLM provide ample justification and then to outline plans for compensation for these sensitive resources with durable conservation actions elsewhere.

"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","Reversing the decline in sage-grouse populations that has occurred over the past 50 years will require significant investments in core/priority habitats as well as general habitat to avoid a patchwork of habitat effectiveness. Our organizations appreciate the level of concern that Magic Valley Energy (MVE) has displayed in public meetings on the project location as it relates to sage-grouse. The proposed project location was selected, in part, due to the “absence of land use constraints such as wildlife management areas, areas of critical environmental concern 
(ACEC)…roadless areas, and other restrictive land use designations.” While we appreciate both MVE and the BLM’s efforts to minimize impacts to sensitive wildlife species, our organizations have initial concerns that this rationale for project location only focuses on the immediate and short-term conditions. Making decisions based only on current conditions may preclude future restoration or conservation actions within the proposed project location that may be necessary to prevent sage-grouse population declines and from once again being a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We encourage the BLM to analyze short, mid, and long-term impacts to sage-grouse within the Idaho Desert Conservation Area as a whole; the proposed project area may become increasingly important for the species persistence as the sagebrush ecosystem continues to be compromised in quantity and quality across the West.  
"
"VEG01","1 - General","VEG","Vegetation Communities inlcuding Noxious Weeds and Invasive Species","IV. The EIS should include analysis of threat of invasive annual grasses and strategies to minimize these. 

Human influences such as invasive species, altered wildfire regimes, and natural disasters are negatively affecting our native plant communities and the many species that depend upon them, including previously referenced wildlife species. Invasive species pose an enormous environmental challenge to western states and territories. Left unchecked, invasive species permanently alter ecosystems and negatively impact the native species and local economies that depend upon them42. Thus, invasive plant species act as one of the most significant change agents at landscape scales – especially in the Great Basin portion of the West. 

Of specific concern is cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). When an ecosystem transitions from sagebrush dominated to cheatgrass-dominated landscapes, fire-return intervals shorten from as long as a 100 or more years to as little as 3 to 5 years43. Just 1% of cheatgrass on the landscape doubles the risk of wildfire44. In areas with intense and frequent fires, nutrient recharge back into the system can be lost, and loss of sagebrush has become detrimental. In recent decades, these characteristic fire frequency and behavior caused by the influx of invasive annual grasses 
(notably cheatgrass) has become the largest threat to western sagebrush landscapes45. The National Interagency Fire Center has been tracking acres burned in Greater Sage-grouse habitat annually. For 2016-2020, among the 11 states where sage-grouse are found, sage-grouse habitat in Idaho comprised approximately 20% of the fires (1.3 million acres), reflecting how large of a problem this is in Idaho46. 

Science shows that invasive species control is more effective and cost-efficient when done early, before infestations become widespread, and when management responses are informed by what’s going on in the surrounding landscape. Management actions must be prioritized, focused, and implemented in a collaborative manner to ensure the greatest conservation and restoration benefits47. Among these partners should be County Cooperative Weed Management Areas, to prevent the introduction, reproduction, and spread of invasive nonnative plants. The “Cheatgrass Challenge” is an example of a partnership of public and private agencies developing strategies to battle cheatgrass. This Idaho-focused effort should be considered as this project proceeds, as the partners have also compiled a strong suite of resources that can be used to proactively address this threat48. Among these is the ‘Rangeland Analysis Platform’ that can be used by the project developer to map rangeland threats and implement a proactive strategy for addressing them.  "
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks"," With the historical backdrop of the forced incarceration of innocent Japanese Americans during World War II, it is morally imperative to protect the Minidoka National Historic Site.  Its significance in the historical perspective and retrospective goes is paramount.  Not only is this site a symbol of the injustice imposed on the Japanese Americans, it serves as a reminder that there are rights that need to be protected, which were not, to wit:
1.  The constitutional rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
2.  The rights of due process as American citizens.
3.  Rights, which were wrongfully deprived before, during and after incarceration.

Moving forward to present day, the right thing to do is to continue to PROTECT the sacred site so the past is never forgotten."
"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","VI. Unnecessary fences should be identified and removed. Where deemed critical, fence design, location, and construction should be done in a wildlife-friendly manner.

Where fences are deemed critical within the proposed project area , the BLM should require fences associated with the project to be constructed using wildlife-friendly fence designs, with special design consideration towards pronghorn, mule deer, sage-grouse, and other bird species. Fences can cause direct impacts (injury or mortality from fence collision) or indirect effects 
(create unintended hazards and barriers for wildlife, from big game to birds, blocking daily wildlife movements, seasonal migrations, and access to forage and water) 51. Avian Species of Greatest Conservation Need that are more vulnerable to fence collision and entanglement include Greater Sage-grouse, Ferruginous Hawk, Golden Eagle, Burrowing Owl, and Short-Eared Owl52. Big game species that are most well-known for their challenges with fences are mule deer, pronghorn and elk. 

Siting and designing fence structures to be wildlife-friendly has been proven to reduce negative interactions for wildlife species. Fences pose particular collision hazards to Greater Sage-Grouse when located <2 km from known leks, where fence segments lack wooden fence posts, and where fence segments exceed 4 m (13.1 ft)53. Research on sage-grouse has shown that fence markers can reduce fence collisions by 70% to more than 80%54. Wildlife-friendly fences can also be constructed to be compatible with livestock needs. To mitigate the impacts of newly constructed fences, unnecessary fences (or other structures) within or adjacent to the project area should be identified and removed. This proactive effort will help minimize the risks on the landscape to birds and big game. "
"CUL01","1 - General Cultural Resources","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","The enormity of the proposed wind farm with the hundreds of massive wind turbines, sprawling corridors, miles of transmission lines, seven substations, and hundreds of miles of roads and pathways  poses a huge threat to cultural resources and historical sites within Twin Falls County, within the proposed project area itself, and beyond the perimeters of the planned energy project. 

Twin Falls County Impacts

•	The wind energy project would definitely affect the aesthetics of several National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) sites in Twin Falls County, sites such as the nineteenth-century Rock Creek Station and Stricker Homesite on the Oregon Trail, the Brose House, built in 1905, the Milner Dam, completed in 1905, and the Oregon Trail, dating to the 1840s, and the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument /Oregon Trail, located on the bluffs of the Snake River near the county’s western border.  Their stories reflect the unique contributions to the heritage and development of our county, and their settings provide scenes reminiscent of what emigrants, homesteaders, early settlers, or communities may have observed decades ago.   Such authenticity enhances the heritage sites, providing more meaningful experiences for those who visit these landmarks, like the estimated 2000 visitors who toured the Rock Creek Station and Stricker Homesite six miles south of Hansen, Idaho, in 2019.  The open views of the mountains to the north, the hills to the south, and the rolling lands to the east and west allow imaginations to step back to a time of covered wagons, dusty trails, and uncertainty about the trail ahead.  For a project like Lava Ridge to interrupt these open views with hundreds of wind turbines the height of Seattle’s Space Needle, a network of transmission lines, and necessary infrastructure is an intrusion on the aesthetics and quality of these historical sites.  Their heritage significance cannot be understated, and their viewsheds are an integral part of the story, deserving of protection.  To allow for the development of the enormous wind farm would negate the time, effort, and money expended by the TFCHPC researching and nominating the above-mentioned sites on the NRHP.  Additionally, such visual intrusions would not enrich the knowledge of “future generations” who would visit and learn from the current NRHP sites in Twin Falls County.

•	Twin Falls County has over 1200 historic properties in the foothills of the South Hills, along the Snake River Canyon rim, and in the ranch and farmlands surrounding Twin Falls.  The viewsheds and historic integrity of the sites would be affected by the presence of a wind farm to the north and its infrastructure. Planned construction of transmission lines through the county east of Twin Falls poses a threat to the research and documentation of these sites.  Potential discoveries of significant artifacts / sites may be destroyed through the construction process of the transmission lines."
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","	Viewscapes at the Minidoka National Historic Site would be diminished by the widespread placement of wind turbines, transmission lines, etc.  For the descendants of the more than 9000 Japanese Americans who were forced to live in this relocation camp during World War II, the site itself and the viewscapes are considered sacred.  Japanese Americans make annual pilgrimages to Minidoka to pay respects to those who were imprisoned here.  If wind turbines are erected as close as two miles away, the impacts on the historical and spiritual integrity of the site are immeasurable.  Even distant views of the turbines would diminish the revered atmosphere of the National Historic Site.  "
"DECI09","9 - Agency Planning Regulations or Federal Laws","DECI","Decision Process"," As stated, the Lava Ridge Wind Energy Project would affect a variety of historical sites in Twin Falls County and the surrounding area.  Viewsheds add to the aesthetics of a historic property and are deserving of the protections outlined in several preservation acts.  For instance, the National Historic Preservation Act passed by Congress in 1966 to establish standards of historic preservation states in Section 1 (b)(4),

“the preservation of this irreplaceable heritage is in the public interest so that its vital legacy of cultural, educational, aesthetic, inspirational, economic, and energy benefits will be maintained and enriched for future generations of Americans.”  


Additionally, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. calls for the protections of visual resources.
 
•	Section 102 (a)(8). States that “...the public lands be managed in a manner that will protect the quality of the...scenic...values....”    

•	Section 103 (c). Identifies “scenic values” as one of the resources for which public land should be managed.    

•	Section 201 (a). States that “The Secretary shall prepare and maintain on a continuing basis an inventory of all public lands and their resources and other values (including...scenic values)....”    

•	Section 505 (a). Requires that “Each right-of-way shall contain terms and conditions which will... minimize damage to the scenic and esthetic values....”  

Also, further support for the protection of aesthetics comes from the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 43 U.S.C. 4321, which states in Section 101 (b)(3) that measures be taken to “ ...assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings.” 

Protections against disruptions to the viewscapes and aesthetics of historic properties in Twin Falls County and the surrounding areas by Lava Ridge’s 400 wind turbines on 76,000 acres are an integral part of the preservation laws cited and must be implemented by the BLM.  "
"ALT02","2 - Suggested New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","Use of previously disturbed lands -  Properties such as brownfields and degraded lands may be better locations for projects like Ridge.  Utilizing lands where the environment and resources have been previously disturbed, would be far better than choosing a site where a wind farm would impact historic sites, geologic formations, open spaces, cultural resources, wildlife, sensitive bird and raptor species, recreation, grazing, and local communities.  Siting energy projects on such lands only makes sense.  "
"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","We appreciate that as currently planned, the Project site appears to conform to the Idaho BLM sage-grouse plans’ prohibition against wind energy development in Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMAs). In addition, the Project’s June 2021 Plan of Development states that all wind turbines and associated infrastructure within a 3.1 mile buffer of active sage-grouse leks have been removed (Magic Valley Energy 2021 at C-3). However, the Project has been sited in sage-grouse General Habitat Management Area (GHMA), which means that it will negatively impact sage-grouse, which continue to decline in abundance in Idaho and the West.1 The Draft EIS should include alternatives proposing robust, specific sage-grouse mitigation to offset the effects of habitat fragmentation and loss, as well as to offset the impacts of introducing tall structures (wind turbines and power/transmission lines) into sage-grouse habitat. The effectiveness of any proposed mitigation for greater sage-grouse or other wildlife should also be addressed in the Draft EIS. To protect greater sage-grouse and birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), power lines should be undergrounded as much as possible. This will reduce the number of new hunting perches for raptor species that prey on sage-grouse. Undergrounding power lines will also reduce collision and electrocution risk for raptors and other birds protected by the MBTA."
"SSW05","5 - Eagles","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","To protect eagle reproduction, blasting should not take place within two miles of eagle nests during breeding season. In California and Nevada, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) recommends a two-mile buffer for blasting during golden eagle breeding season (FWS 2020). FWS recently required that two-mile buffer in a golden eagle incidental take permit for the Hycroft Mine in Nevada (FWS 2019 at unnumbered page 4). There is no scientific reason why eagles in Idaho should not receive similar protection.

To protect eagles and other wildlife that consume carrion, it is very important that low speed limits within the Project boundaries are established and enforced, and that roadkill and livestock carcasses are quickly removed."
"SSW04","4 - Greater Sage Grouse","SSW","Special Status Wildlife","The Draft EIS should include detailed information about greater sage-grouse in the Project area, including the name of the Population Management Unit (PMU), lek trends in the area and for that PMU time, how sage-grouse use the area seasonally, maps of sage-grouse seasonal habitat use, and whether any hard or soft population or habitat triggers have been reached, as well as what is known about the causes of any triggers that have been reached and the adaptive management measures BLM has adopted to respond to them."
"VEG01","1 - General","VEG","Vegetation Communities inlcuding Noxious Weeds and Invasive Species","In addition, during reclamation of infrastructure projects, even properly planned and executed seeding efforts can and do fail. Therefore, seeding activities must be accompanied by a two-growing-season rest period from livestock grazing to enable the best chance for re-vegetation establishment and survival. The long-term planning process associated with a project as large as this one will allow for seed collection from the same ecological sites and for growth of sagebrush seedlings. Successful sagebrush seedings are notoriously difficult. However, containerized seedlings have a much higher establishment rate. Planting containerized seedlings requires an organizational infrastructure of seed collection, germination, growth and planting. BLM’s Seeds of Success program has been working with institutional partners in the Great Basin. Those efforts could perhaps be expanded to incorporate reclamation of this Project, both interim and long term. Areas of the Project site that are designated habitat management areas for greater sage-grouse should be re-seeded with native species chosen to support greater sage-grouse."

These sites provoke connections to individuals affected by the World War II exclusion, forced removal, and unjust incarceration, and serves to commemorate those who survived this difficult chapter of American history.” 

I lived for over 70 years with questions about my mother’s life and the deep loss of never knowing her. Minidoka NHS helps heal the pain of losing her and provides me with a sense of closure. 

Minidoka also commemorates her life and the sacrifices she made to raise me before her passing. The wind project would dishonor her memory and the memories of those who died in camp and make it harder for NPS to commemorate the lives of over 13,000 people who were incarcerated there.  "
"DECI08","8 - Relationship to Policies, Plans, and Programs","DECI","Decision Process","For the record, let me emphatically state that I am not only an ardent supporter of expanding renewable energy sources for this country, I am also an equally ardent supporter of the Endangered Species Act and sage grouse conservation. It is not lost on me that during the Obama Administration, BLM adopted and actively promoted its “Smart from the Start” renewable energy policy that was designed to steer renewable projects away from high conflict sites on public lands and redirect them to low conflict sites to facilitate their construction. Steering Lava Ridge away from sage grouse habitat is “Smart From the Start.” 
By contrast, redirecting the project to an alternative site that invades the historic footprint of Minidoka and destroys the viewshed of the Historic Site is the very antithesis of “Smart from the Start,” and guarantees nothing less than an all out legal battle with an angered and disappointed Japanese American community along with our partners. "
"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","Lava Ridge would change that spiritual connection with Minidoka forever and its statistics are staggering: 400 wind turbines as high as 740 feet tall, dwarfing the Washington Monument and the Seattle Space Needle. Not only would some of the turbines actually be built within the historic footprint of Minidoka, an estimated 340 of them would be permanently visible within the viewshed from the Minidoka Visitor Center. 
In 1942, the federal government encircled our camp with barbed wire. In 2021, BLM is being asked to encircle our sacred site with massive wind turbine towers and blades. Instead of being able to connect with the same lonely landscape that my mother had seen at her end, I would now be constantly distracted by massive twirling blades on an endless sea of turbines. "

(Hanning et al., 2012) 

This information is shocking and disturbing. Windmills have been reported to cause all sorts of health problems for people of various ages and different genders. In May 2013 another article titled Adverse health effects of industrial wind turbines was released by three Canadian doctors; Roy D. Jeffery, Carmen Krogh and Brett Horner. The introductory paragraph of this article states; 

""Canadian family physicians can expect to see increasing numbers of rural patients reporting adverse effects from exposure to industrial wind turbines (IWTs). People who live or work in close proximity to IWTs have experienced symptoms that include decreased quality of life, annoyance, stress, sleep disturbance, headache, anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. Some have also felt anger, grief, or a sense of injustice. Suggested causes of symptoms include a combination of wind turbine noise, infrasound, dirty electricity, ground current, and shadow flicker. Family physicians should be aware that patients reporting adverse effects from IWTs might experience symptoms that are intense and pervasive and might feel further victimized by a lack of caregiver understanding."" (Jeffery et al., 2013) 

By allowing the Lava Ridge Wind Project to continue, we are subjecting members of our community to these unhealthy and almost unlivable conditions. "

"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","The category of wildlife that would be the most adversely affected are birds.

With the installation of these industrial wind turbines, our area will no longer be habitable for these majestic creatures. "
"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","For this project, 380 miles of roads will have to be constructed from turbine to turbine, as well as trenching that must be done to bury miles and miles of underground cables. Each turbine has a concrete base that goes about 15 feet into the ground. In the project it has also been proposed that the area be used for the decommissioning of windmills as well. The most common practice of decommissioning windmills is to dig a hole and bury the old wind turbine parts. All of this digging and trenching will displace many burrowing animals. Foxes, badgers, skunks, burrowing owls, burrowing toads, sage grouse, and many other animals' habitats will be destroyed. Many of these animal populations have already been on the decline and will suffer greatly from the increased traffic as well as the noise disruptions. 

The addition of a windfarm to our area would be detrimental to the health of every living thing that calls our area home. Animals have refined senses and therefore will be extremely affected by this project. However, even humans will experience adverse side effects to the industrial wind turbines. The unfavorable influence that the Lava Ridge Wind Project will have is destructive and irreversible."

"WATER03","3 - Groundwater","WATER","Water Resources ","The construction of Lava Ridge would require a great deal of resources to construct, including water. Each wind turbine foundation would require around 21,600 gallons of water for the turbine foundations. To get a sense of the required water use, this means that for every three wind turbines constructed, an olympic swimming pool’s worth of water would be used just to create three foundations. The entire project’s water needs could fill over 133 olympic swimming pools for the turbine foundations. The primary land use in the proposed project area is agriculture. Magic Valley Energy/LS Power intends to develop up to six new groundwater wells during construction and four during operations and maintenance. An unknown amount of water will likely be needed for dust suppression during construction and operations. The BLM should consider the use of magnesium chloride on unpaved routes or paving certain high use roads or intersections in order to address dust issues and save water. The DEIS should consider the impact of this much water use on the local water supply, which is already limited. In terms of mitigating the increased water use, there are likely to be a number of water conservation measures that could be implemented in and around the project area for existing operations. Having Magic Valley Energy/LS Power support these conservation measures could be helpful. There is also the potential for improvements in waste management so that existing agricultural operations have the tools and resources to improve water quality leaving their operations and entering the groundwater or surface water.

These micro adjustments may or may not sufficiently respond to issues raised in the NEPA process. These issues include effects to recreational amenities such as parking areas, trailheads, trails, and hunting camps, cultural resources, grave sites, rattlesnake hibernaculum, rare plant habitat, among others.

We see the potential need for increased public education and law enforcement in and around the project area. If recreational shooting opportunities are identified as an issue, the BLM could consider designating an official target range in a suitable area. Should any motorized routes be closed as a result of the project development, we recommend improving other existing motorized routes and trailheads as mitigation.

"NOI01","1 - General","NOI","Noise","One of the key ‘special audible characteristics’ of wind farm sound is the amplitude modulation (AM) of the sound over time as the turbine blades are turning, which results in a rise and fall in wind farm loudness. This is usually characterised as a ‘whoosh–whoosh–whoosh’ sound modulated at the blade-passing frequency (usually around 1–2 Hz). This sound is usually evident, to some extent, in all wind turbine sound due to the nature of the noise generation mechanism at the turbine blade. However, the extent (or level) of modulation, known as the modulation depth, can vary significantly depending on the environmental conditions, and some objective measure of the extent of amplitude modulation, and its acceptability, is required. Some simple objective measures for AM were documented in the early wind farm sound policies and standards, but there is generally a concern that these were not rigorously developed, and their relationship to the extent of annoyance has never been adequately demonstrated.
	An Australian committee recommends that wind farm operators be encouraged to continuously monitor wind turbine sound at some sensitive locations and be encouraged to incorporate these sound measurements as part of their SCADA systems. This sound data should be monitored by signal processing systems to detect unusual sounds such as tonality and excessive amplitude modulation."

If not for attending the pilgrimage, it is doubtful that my father would have felt comfortable sharing his stories of loss, fear, and hopelessness.  As someone who normally shies away from public speaking, my father felt compelled to share his stories with other incarcerees and their families.  Allowing my father to re-experience Minidoka were the first steps toward healing from the trauma he experienced during his incarceration.

Now to learn that a power company wants to build 400+ gigantic windmills in and around Minidoka is very painful to my father, his fellow incarcerees, and the descendants of the incarcerees.

"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","The sheer scale of the proposed project and its location in an area of importance for birds mandates that comprehensive field studies be conducted to inform wind turbine siting. This is further reinforced by the proposed location on public land – this demands a high standard for adherence to the mitigation hierarchy. Clean energy projects on public lands should not contribute to the continuing decline of our nation’s birds. 
"
"WILD03","3 - Migratory Birds (incl. raptors) and Bats ","WILD","General Wildlife","Due to their flight behavior and relatively slow rate of reproduction, many raptor species are vulnerable to fatal collisions with wind turbines. At one wind energy facility in California, Golden Eagle populations were only maintained by “continental scale migration,” i.e., mortality caused by collisions with wind turbines was only offset by drawing in additional birds at a massive scale.  

A more recent study found that five species – Golden Eagle, Ferruginous Hawk, American Kestrel, Barn Owl, and Red-tailed Hawk – are at risk of population-level declines specifically as a result of wind energy development.1 Among these, two species of conservation concern are likely to be present on the Lava Ridge site: Golden Eagle and Ferruginous Hawk. 
 
The Plan of Development (POD) for the proposed project indicates that “eagle/raptor nest surveys” will be conducted. Given the known risk that wind turbines pose to raptors, and the importance of this area for these species, this level of survey effort is grossly insufficient to inform risk assessment in an EIS. 

Nest surveys do not effectively evaluate raptor collision risk during the critically important spring and fall migration periods, during winter months, or during post-breeding dispersal, when naïve juvenile birds enter the population. Birds are present in different numbers, behave differently, and are vulnerable to collisions with wind turbines in all of these periods. 

The POD does not specify the number of years of surveys that will be conducted. It is important that multiple years of raptor studies be conducted to account for inter-annual variation in distribution and abundance of raptors, and the generally low densities of these birds. We note that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) recommends two years of surveys to inform wind facility planning.6 

Recommendations 
1.	Raptor surveys should be conducted on the site and vicinity to the following specifications:

"NOI01","1 - General","NOI","Noise","Regarding potential noise impacts to receptors and biological resources, EPA recommends that the NEPA analysis:
•	Evaluate decibel (dB) levels, the effects of noise levels on a variety of species, and effects on sensitive receptors, residences, recreational users, and property values. It is important to describe the timing, duration, and reoccurrence of noise as they may occur over multiple construction seasons;
•	Identify in the noise impact assessment the significance threshold utilized in the impact assessment methodology. EPA identified a goal of 55 A-weighted decibels (dBA) for outdoor residential areas to fully protect the public health and welfare.4 For low-frequency sounds often associated with wind turbines, EPA encourages BLM to consider using C-weighted and/or A- weighted metrics;
•	Compare noise impacts among alternatives and quantify the number of sensitive receptors that will be exposed for each alternative. This information may be useful to decision-makers and reveal opportunities to minimize impacts to the most affected receptors during micro-siting of WTGs; and
•	Indicate mitigation measures which will lessen or avoid adverse noise impacts.
The project may affect noise levels, resulting in potential health impacts. There is increasing evidence that noise impacts can have non-auditory health effects. A 2007 review article that summarizes studies from the National Library of Medicine database on the adverse health effects of noise notes that long- term physical health effects have been linked to noise effects related to sleep disturbances, stress, and increased blood pressure, and can increase cardiovascular disease risk.5 These effects begin to be seen with long-term daily exposure to noise levels above 65 dB or with acute exposure to noise above 80-85 dB.6 The World Health Organization recommends that, where noise is continuous, the equivalent sound pressure level should not exceed 30 dBA indoors if negative effects on sleep are to be avoided.7 When the noise is composed of a large proportion of low-frequency sounds, a still lower guideline value is recommended because low frequency noise can disturb rest and sleep even at low sound pressure levels. It is also relevant to mention that recent scientific studies have shown that some migratory birds will avoid excessively noisy areas during migration.8 This will need to be carefully considered since Idaho hosts many threatened and endangered migratory bird populations along their migration routes."

This could help inform the development of measures to improve the climate resilience of the proposed project. If projected climate-related changes could notably stress the affected environment or exacerbate the environmental impacts of the project, these impacts should also be considered as part of the NEPA analysis. For example, adaptation strategies could include an extreme weather event analysis to minimize or prevent a disruption of power or loss of energy to consumers from natural disaster events. An increase in the magnitude or frequency of extreme events can severely challenge utility systems that are not designed to withstand intense events. Extreme event analyses or modeling can help develop a better understanding of the risks and consequences associated with these types of events;

•	Indicate expected sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions usually associated with gas-insulated switchgears on the WTGs and measures to be taken to minimize these emissions. One action that could be taken is for BLM to require adoption of SF6-free switchgears (“clean-air”) or other equipment. If SF6-free switchgears are determined to be technically infeasible, or are unavailable, the Applicant could also limit SF6 leaks to the extent practicable or required by state or federal regulations. SF6 is the most potent known greenhouse gas, with the potential to trap infrared radiation approximately 23,000 times more effectively than carbon dioxide. SF6 is also a very stable chemical, with an atmospheric lifetime of 3,200 years. Thus, a relatively small amount of SF6 can have a significant impact on global climate change; and

Section 110 of the NHPA places an affirmative responsibility on federal agencies to manage and maintain historic properties under their jurisdiction or control. Furthermore, this section provides that historic properties not under agency jurisdiction or control but potentially affected by agency actions are to be fully considered in agency planning. Since BLM owns and manages portions of the Minidoka landscape, the Bureau has an affirmative responsibility under Section 110 to determine the landscape's eligibility for listing.

"NPS03","3 - Minidoka NHS","NPS","National Parks","We strongly encourage the DOI and the BLM to fully consider the Lava Ridge Wind Project’s overwhelmingly negative impact on Minidoka National Historic Site and its associated community of Japanese American incarceration survivors and descendants, as well as the broader American public’s ability to remember and learn from the incarceration. By transforming a sacred site of unfettered, isolated healing and commemoration into a vast industrial energy complex, this project is in direct opposition to the mandate of the DOI and NPS to preserve the site and associated resources unimpaired for future generations, and in opposition to the Department’s priorities to advance racial justice.

"CUL04","4 - Japanese American Concerns","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","This project would dishonor victims of racial prejudice and would be a step backward in the government’s reconciliation to acknowledge the injustice of the wholesale incarceration of Japanese Americans. "
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","The BLM needs to describe how local agricultural operations (allotment management, water projects for livestock, fencing for livestock, irrigation pivots, canals, crop dusting and truck traffic) will be affected by project construction and operations. We believe that wind projects are largely compatible with agricultural and pastoral activities but acknowledge that some shifts in practices may be required. Some issues may be addressed in the location of turbines and roads and seasonal or daily timing restrictions during construction activities. Should any upgrades in agricultural operations be needed, such as for irrigation, pesticide or herbicide application, or livestock fencing, we recommend that affected producers work directly with Magic Valley Energy/LS Power and the BLM on site specific design features. It may be that there are improved methods for pesticide application, for example, that are more sensitive to the environment than current practices. There have also been some recent developments with regard to virtual fencing that might help address any fence modifications.  "

"DECI05","5 - Section 106 Consultation ","DECI","Decision Process"," It would be wise if the BLM included the National Park Service, Friends of Minidoka, and The Minidoka Pilgrimage Committee as official consulting parties during the NEPA process as well as engage in nation-to-nation consulting with the Shoshone Bannock and all Native American tribes connected to this region. "
"CUL04","4 - Japanese American Concerns","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","These sites are considered sacred to the survivors and descendant communities, many of whom pilgrimage to them annually. To me, this project is absolutely unacceptable. To implement it will be a grave offense done to not only those within the Japanese American community, but to anyone who cares about preserving American history."
"CUL01","1 - General Cultural Resources","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","JACSC requests that the BLM perform comprehensive environmental analysis to evaluate the cumulative impacts to both Minidoka National Historic Site, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, as well as a comprehensive inventory of other historic and cultural resources within the impacted area of the project. This review must include analysis of viewshed, light, noise, geology, hydrology, birds and wildlife, as well as the historic and cultural resources."
"FIRE01","1 - General","FIRE","Fire and Fuels Management","Damage to waterlines, wells and troughs. SLC have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on water development for the allotment. This includes drilling five wells to depths of 600 to 800 feet, pumps, 60 to 80 miles of pipeline, underground wire to power pumps, water storage tanks, and troughs. In the last two years we spent nearly one hundred thousand dollars on water storage and pipe. 

The Storage tank was designed to provide a 150,000-gallon, ready source of water for fire suppression efforts, easily accessible for helicopter pickup and provide safe water storage for livestock. The ranchers and their families are all active in the RFPA and spend time each summer fighting fire on these and other allotments in the area. If approved and built, SLC want firm answers on how fire suppression would work in and around the site. We can’t imagine that Magic Valley Energy would want their windmills slathered with red fire retardant, or that any air tanker would be persuaded to go near an eight-hundred-foot whirling turbine blade. With aerial firefighting many times being the difference between success and failure in these situations; how will that be addressed?"
"GRAZ01","1 - General","GRAZ","Livestock Grazing","3.	During the construction phase of this project SLC fear the allotment will be unusable for grazing. For the reasons stated above. 

LS Power estimated that construction would take only two years. Constructing a project of this magnitude in this terrain and climate in two years seems unrealistic, if accomplished it would be at great cost to the resource. It is more likely to take several years. However long the construction phase is during this time, where do we graze our cattle?  Finding pasture in the area for 3500 head of cattle is would be impossible.  If pasture can be located, it would be at great expense and unfamiliar to our animals resulting in herd health issues.  This is just reflecting what the Star Lake allotment supports. If you add the numbers from the other affected allotments including North Milner, Sid Butte and Dietrich Butte, 3500 head of livestock likely increases to five or six thousand head displaced in the area. Those cattle alone likely generate economic activity of 6 to 7 million a year that goes directly in to the local economy.  "
"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","These allotments support elk, deer and antelope herds and are active hunting and recreation areas.

"PROJ01","1 - General","PROJ","Project Description"," With this equipment having a useful lifespan of around twenty years is does it make sense to build it knowing that new technologies are being developed that will make these projects obsolete in a short time? 

The estimate of temporary land disturbance for the Lava Ridge project is ten or eleven thousand acres or about ten percent of the project area with about 3 or 4 precent being permanently disturbed or altered. Rehab of these areas will take years with such a short project lifespan and possible decommissioning or equipment replacement will these areas ever properly recover or do we just resign these lands to become a weed patch for the next twenty-five years."

"SOC01","1 - General","SOC","Socioeconomics","LS Power is not a local company. The power produced will not be used in Idaho, it will be sold out of state.  This project is not multiple use friendly; it will be a 130,000-acre private power production facility on public land used to enrich an out of state company and produce power for out of state interests. The federal government may benefit from right of way fees, but the citizens of Idaho lose."
"ALT01","1 - General Deficiency, Inadequate Range of Alts","ALT","Alternatives","It is my conclusion that the Lava Ridge Wind Project would have a severe negative impact upon all aspects of this sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Based upon my research and the well-being of this environment I feel the project should not be approved. Or, to a lesser extent, approved with the modification that the magnitude of the project be substantially reduced. "
"CUL04","4 - Japanese American Concerns","CUL","Cultural Resources and Native American Concerns","The Lava Ridge proposal would be a slap in the face for the 120,000 US citizens that were forcibly incarcerated by the US government during World War II and for the families of the 13,000 people that were held at Minidoka. Japanese Americans have already suffered terrible pain and losses. This project would take away a place that provides so much healing for the members or Portland JACL and the Japanese American community with ties to the Pacific NW region.    "
"WILD01","1 - General/Other ","WILD","General Wildlife","This land may seem simply to be a desert but it is home to plants that are being encroached upon in the surrounding areas, home to the nearly extinct Sage-grouse, home to ungulates from Blaine County and the surrounding areas, and much more. With the expansive amount of land to be used between roads, substations, and so on--these animals and plants will continue to face challenges that they may never rebound from. Renewable energy is pertinent but not at the expense of habitats and ecosystems that are already being devastated by growth and development. We have seen what renewable energy has done to our salmon populations along the Columbia River, which has cost close to $17 billion in failed recovery efforts. The sage-grouse lets us know how habitats are doing and with their current numbers, they are evidence that such habitats and ecosystems are literally dying. So build this windfarm but these animals, plants, and entire ecosystems will not be forgotten and in 30 or 40 years billions will be spent on recovering lost species and habitats--just as is being done on the Columbia River at this time and for the past 40 years. And this is just talking about the land use, what about the air use? Many avian species use this area as a migration corridor--animals that are pertinent for many ecosystems in the North American and Mexican west. I believe that this project should be relocated and should not be built at the expense of so much wildlife and ecosystems. "
