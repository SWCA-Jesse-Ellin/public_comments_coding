"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"While some of this massive new infrastructure may be considered “temporary” (e.g., the ice roads and pads), that does not mean the temporary infrastructure will not have significant impacts to wildlife and subsistence from their construction and use. BLM must analyze the impacts of ongoing disturbance if facilities and roads are left in place, and the impacts from eventual road removal and reclamation efforts."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"BLM cannot simply tier to the affected environment considered in the IAP. The IAP is a high-level plan covering the entire Reserve and does not contain adequate site-specific information for the evaluation of Willow. The FEIS also did not contain a detailed enough analysis of the baseline conditions specific to the Willow area. New studies may be needed in light of changes to resources resulting from climate change and other new information related to the scale of industrial developments and impacts in the region, even since the release of the prior FEIS. BLM must ensure it has up-to-date, site-specific studies and modeling in the northeastern region of the Reserve to determine how a project of this scale is likely to change nearby air quality, hydrology, and habitat."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"This project would have significant impacts across the entire National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska (Reserve) and broader region, and its significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have global consequences. "
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Willow is contrary to the action necessary to address the climate emergency and is inconsistent with this administration’s priorities and policy commitments"
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"BLM also needs to do further studies to understand the negative impacts this project will have on caribou migration, fish, and other wildlife. BLM should conduct a comprehensive study in Nuiqsut to fully assess the subsistence, socioeconomic, cultural, recreational, health and other negative impacts of this project combined with other ongoing and future projects, and should ensure that information is shared with the community. BLM cannot meaningfully evaluate Willow’s potential impacts and necessary mitigation measures without all of this information."
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"The IAP is particularly important for establishing which best management practices (BMPs) apply to Willow. BLM’s approach in the Willow FEIS to simply list the mitigation contained in both IAPs did not address these significant shortcomings.251 BLM must describe how it will enforce the BMPs from the IAP for Willow."
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,,"Finally, the SEIS must analyze the effects of the GHG pollution resulting from the Willow Project in isolation, and in combination with other oil and gas activities in the Arctic on the survival and recovery of polar bears. The FEIS failed to do so.... Simply put, increased oil and gas development from Willow and the westward development it would enable will increase GHG pollution, thereby exacerbating the primary threat to polar bears and frustrating recovery. BLM’s SEIS must acknowledge this reality and address how the Willow project, in addition to other existing and future development in polar bear critical habitat, can be consistent with the recovery of polar bears."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"BLM should wait until it has concluded its review of the 2020 IAP before beginning the Willow supplemental process so it is clear what measures apply to this decision.102 The decisions made in the IAP will have significant implications for Willow’s direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts because the IAP determines the likely extent of potential future development in the Reserve, determines the boundaries of Special Areas, and affects the applicability of various mitigation measures."
"TRI","Tribal Engagement",,," BLM should also grant any additional requests by affected tribes for cooperating agency status under NEPA"
"ENPTCE","Cumulative Effects",,,"The SEIS must also fully consider the climate impacts of additional industrial activities and GHG emissions associated with reasonably foreseeable future activities.249"
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"Any reconsideration of Willow should occur after BLM completes its evaluation of the 2020 IAP and determines whether to issue a ROD selecting a different alternative, which may be as soon as spring of 2022, so it is clear what measures apply to this decision."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"As discussed above, the Corps should also use this new process as an opportunity to rectify the serious problems with its previous compensatory mitigation determination"
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"neither its Draft EIS, Supplemental Draft EIS, nor Final EIS analyzed the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) and other well stimulation techniques under the project. BLM must rectify these legal errors by analyzing these impacts in its new analysis."
"ESA","ESA consultation and analysis",,,"The prior EIS contained numerous legal and analytical flaws in its consideration of impacts to polar bears and failed to comply with NEPA, as well as the ESA and MMPA, as described above.312 Those shortcomings must be rectified through this SEIS process."
"S","Subsistence",,,"ConocoPhillips’ proposed project is also within and adjacent to the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, one of the most productive wetland complexes in the Arctic and an important calving and foraging ground for the Teshekpuk Lake Caribou Herd, an important subsistence resource for communities on the North Slope."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,," It would also place infrastructure in the Colville River Special Area, which provides important habitat to birds as well and subsistence resources. Expanding development in these areas would harm biodiversity and fragment otherwise intact habitat."
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,,"The SEIS should include an accurate, quantitative analysis of potential impacts to denning bears and cubs. Industrial activities may significantly disturb polar bears at maternal den sites, with polar bears reacting in a variety of ways depending on factors such as the level of exposure and distance of the den site from the industrial activity."
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,," BLM must fully analyze the potential impacts to threatened and already-declining polar bear populations. BLM must also analyze and assess the effectiveness of potential mitigation measures to reduce impacts to polar bears in the SEIS."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,," BLM also has authority to deny or delay an application for permit to drill (APD),31 and ConocoPhillips’ leases reflect BLM’s authority to condition, restrict, or prohibit activities.32 This authority should be rectified in the SEIS process."
"RTTLSA","Teshekpuk Lake and other Special Areas",,,"The TLSA is not “only an administrative boundary.” Congress specifically directed the agency to ensure that oil and gas activity in the TLSA “be conducted in a manner which will assure the maximum protection of such surface values to the extent consistent with the requirements of this Act for the exploration of the reserve.” The EIS’s assertion that Project impacts may not “necessarily be greater within the TLSA than they would outside the TLSA” entirely distorts this Congressional directive"
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"The most appropriate path forward is for BLM to prepare a revised draft EIS that can re-examine the project purpose and need "
"PETIAP","Integrated Activity Plan (IAP)",,," Moreover, BLM should not even begin any NEPA process until ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. (ConocoPhillips) submits new permit applications for the agency to act on, and only after the Department of Interior (Interior) concludes its review of the Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) for the Reserve and articulates a management direction consistent with the administration’s climate and biodiversity goals."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Climate change effects are already occurring in the Reserve and are expected to increase. The Willow project will intensify these impacts by causing further changes to wildlife behavior, hydrology, permafrost, and subsistence hunting patterns. BLM is obligated under NEPA to analyze not only the effects of proposed actions on climate change, but also the implications of climate change on the environmental impacts of this proposed action."
"ESA","ESA consultation and analysis",,," BLM must consider the impacts from Willow on these [marine mammal] species, and consult with NMFS and FWS as appropriate for threatened and endangered species. BLM must fully consider the Willow’s impacts in terms of contributions to chronic ocean noise on the acoustic environment and vessel strikes of marine mammals, particularly comparing impacts of barging in modules, as proposed by ConocoPhillips."
"PETPD","Project Description",,,"BLM must describe how the project complies with all laws and policies meant to ensure proper management of public lands and wildlife, particularly the ESA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and their regulations, as discussed below.

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"Please do not allow ConocoPhillips' Western Arctic drilling plan."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"  I am commenting to voice support for the cancellation of the Willow Master development plan. This oil and gas network will be detrimental to the environment. Given the already fragile ecosystem and rising Arctic temperatures, this plan will cause irreversible damage. Additionally, it will negatively impact the people living in the area, especially the Indigenous communities, by introducing various pollutants to the area that have the potential to negatively impact their health. This development plan also goes against climate crisis objects and will set back the progress that is being made"
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," Given the current climate reality, it is unconscionable for fossil fuel mining and drilling to continue, let alone to issue permits for new extraction. I therefore urge you most strongly to to stop ConocoPhillips’ disastrous Western Arctic drilling plan."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Definite major emissions over a thirty year period which contribute to worsening climate change.
3. Violation of our commitment, therefor, under the Paris Climate Accord to REDUCE, not increase emissions contributing to climate change.
4. Impacts on the Alaska coastline itself due to climate change which include erosion undercutting or washing away native villages and difficulties for natives in pursuing traditional fishing and hunting.
5. Impacts on the coastline as far away as Florida because increased emissions contribute to an anticipated sea level rise of at least one foot during the next 30 years.
6. Impacts on both animals and plants as the increased emissions contribute greatly to global warming which leads to further sea ice melting and melting of the permafrost in the tundra. Melting of the permafrost makes this doubly problematic since that melting releases methane which had been stored in the permafrost layer."
"RTNE","Nuiqsut Economics",,,"7. Both short-term and long-term jobs are not necessarily going to benefit local people, as outsiders are often brought in to fill temporary and long-term positions."
"RTEJ","Environmental Justice",,,"What's more, this project would desecrate countless acres of land and water that are the very lifeblood of the Indigenous peoples living upon them. These peoples have lived in harmony with and taken care of their lands for thousands upon thousands of years. They have more right to it than anyone. Profit-hungry white people have already stolen and ruined enough land on this continent."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The climate science is unequivocal: we need to drastically curb our fossil fuel consumption, and indeed sequester carbon out of the atmosphere, if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change. For that reason alone, opening up new wells and investing more money in fossil fuel infrastructure is utterly irresponsible. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"A brief, personal note before the form letter -- the only way humanity can move forward as a species is by divesting ourselves entirely from fossil fuels. Because of this, when viewed in the long term, there is no drilling plan that makes sense or is in humanity's best interest. We cannot continue to ask the planet to sacrifice for the American desire to drive huge cars while paying as little as possible for gasoline. It has nothing left to give. The time to change things is now, and it starts by stopping irresponsible drilling that will destroy pristine wild lands while only continuing to contribute to what could be an extinction-level event for the human race. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"At this time when we are concerned about the warming oceans, severe climate events, and unprecedented wildlife extinction every corporation should be working to pivot to carbon sequestration not an addition to our problems. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW ARCTIC DRILLING OR MINING OF ANY KIND."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"Revisiting the purpose and need statement and considering reasonable alternatives make preparation of a revised draft EIS a more appropriate choice than a supplement because changes to those fundamental aspects of the EIS will ripple through the various resource analyses. In order to ultimately serve its function and be legally adequate, BLM’s NEPA analysis will need to look more like a comprehensive draft EIS than a traditional supplement."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"BLM is not limited to addressing only those issues specifically addressed by the Court. Instead, BLM should comprehensively address the numerous flaws in its prior analysis, as identified in prior public comments, as well as to consider new information and ensure that its analysis and decision is consistent with NEPA and current national policy."

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," I am writing to urge you to please stop ConocoPhillips’ disastrous Western Arctic drilling plan.   "
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The ConocoPhillips’ Western Arctic drilling plan is especially egregious because its very presence would exacerbate the effects of climate change on the vulnerable Arctic itself, while at the same time it would contribute to climate change by precipitating additional fossil fuel emissions globally.

"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"BLM may not defer to ConocoPhillips’ project purpose, nor can it point to ConocoPhillips’ rights as a lessee as limiting its own statutory and regulatory obligation to protect other resources.
NEPA’s implementing regulations provide that an environmental document must “specify the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternative including the proposed action."""
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"According to BLM’s NEPA Handbook:
The applicant’s purpose and need may provide useful background information, but this description must not be confused with the BLM purpose and need for action. The BLM action triggers the NEPA analysis. It is the BLM purpose and need for action that will dictate the range of alternatives and provide a basis for the rationale for eventual selection of an alternative in a decision.68
Thus, BLM should not conflate its purpose and need to be ConocoPhillips’ purpose and need."
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"BLM defined the purpose of the project as “construct[ing] the infrastructure necessary to allow the production and transportation to market of federal oil and gas resources under leaseholds in the northeast area of the [Reserve], consistent with the proponent’s federal oil and gas lease and unit obligations.”
70 This purpose is unreasonably narrow, conflates BLM’s purposes and need for federal action with ConocoPhillips’ purpose and need, and is inconsistent with BLM’s management obligations in the Reserve."
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"The Court’s decision requires BLM to reconsider the purpose and need statement for the Willow project in any SEIS. BLM must prepare a new purpose and need statement that fully accounts for BLM’s management obligations in the Reserve and does not presume that ConocoPhillips is entitled to develop the oil and gas on its leases on the timeline and in the manner dictated by the company. Moreover, the purpose and need statement should account for and be consistent with current national policy to follow science, tackle the climate crisis with the urgency it demands, and advance environmental justice"
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," I urge you to stop ConocoPhillips’ disastrous Western Arctic drilling plan. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," Alaska Wilderness should stay wild for future generations.  "
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"To comply with the Court’s ruling, BLM must develop new alternatives consistent with the agency’s broad authority to condition, restrict, and prohibit oil and gas activity as necessary to protect other resources.83 BLM’s previous consideration of slight changes to ConocoPhillips’ project description cannot be considered meaningful alternatives. In its alternatives analysis, BLM must analyze meaningfully distinct alternatives to ensure that the agency understands the impacts of the alternatives and how they may differ. In crafting other action alternatives, BLM should maintain a broad vision of how to protect sensitive areas and minimize the project’s impacts and footprint."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,," BLM is not limited to the project descriptions described by ConocoPhillips, and is legally obligated to explore and evaluate reasonable alternatives in its SEIS beyond those identified by the project proponent, including those that do not allow ConocoPhillips to extract all possible oil and gas from its leases.84"
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"We strongly encourage BLM to analyze a roadless alternative that provides for seasonal drilling, similar to what takes place at Colville Delta 3 (CD-3). Development that avoids drilling during the snow-free months would mitigate industrial disturbance impacts on nesting birds, caribou fall migration, and summer/fall subsistence activities during these critical times. It also would reduce well blowout risks to open water in wetlands and floodplains. Automatic shut-off valve requirements for pipelines, as well as effective leak detection, would greatly reduce the need for a road to address potential pipeline spills. Drill rigs for a seasonal drilling alternative potentially can be shared in the non-drilling months with ConocoPhillips at other pads, or with another operator (e.g., Oil Search on state lands) to greatly reduce operator costs (similar to what was done when constructing the roadless drillpad, CD-3). BLM should not merely rely on ConocoPhillips’ assessment of the feasibility of such an alternative as it did in the prior EIS;85 it must independently examine the viability of a winter-only drilling alternative itself and consider the environmental tradeoffs. Seasonal drilling should be considered an environmentally preferred alternative and analyzed as a possibility for all other alternatives."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"If BLM considers a roadless design with year-round operations as with Alpine, it should analyze that alternative separately from the seasonal roadless alternative. Year-round drilling activity is likely to involve additional infrastructure, increased impacts from flights, more noise and pollution, and other impacts that would not necessarily be present for a seasonal roadless alternative. The roadless alternative considered in the final EIS included the construction of a massive gravel airstrip and associated facilities to provide year-round air access, which would make a roadless design more feasible.86 The final EIS also demonstrated that the number of helicopter flights over Willow’s project life were identical under ConocoPhillips’ proposed project and Alternative D, where there was no road connection to GMT-2 or Alpine.87 It also showed that the vast majority of flights to Willow would occur during the summer — such flights could be avoided via seasonal drilling.88 Thus, BLM should consider an alternative that does not involve a road connection with GMT-2, both under a seasonal drilling and year-round drilling scenario."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"BLM should also analyze an alternative that expands the existing facilities at Alpine instead of constructing and operating an entirely new processing facility, which may reduce impacts by taking advantage of existing infrastructure and lessens the potential impacts of Willow serving as a hub for additional development within the Reserve."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"BLM should also evaluate an alternative that eliminates the barging of modules, which may eliminate impacts to marine mammals offshore, along the coast, and within the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, as well as eliminating the need for an ice bridge over the Colville River."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"BLM should fully evaluate the positive and negative trade-offs of the different alternatives such as road disturbances compared to aircraft disturbances, including mitigating aviation impacts to the maximum extent possible, habitat fragmentation and other road impacts on wildlife, gravel acquisition and transport impacts from roads, water impacts from ice roads and the need to construct a freshwater reservoir, enhanced leak detection, and automatic valve shut-offs reducing the need for roads in pipeline spill response, etc. BLM should also consider if there are different configurations for a seasonal roadless alternative that might reduce the footprint and overall impacts of the alternative."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"BLM should also clearly articulate and explain its rationale regarding the scope of the project being analyzed for purposes of the alternatives in the SEIS"
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"The FEIS purported to consider certain drill sites in the future as cumulative impacts — specifically, for Greater Willow, ConocoPhillips’ planned expansion that would add two adjacent drill sites to Willow. The agencies had information on these drill sites that may have been sufficient to analyze them as an alternative, including the proposed site locations, estimates of production amounts, and timing of construction (as soon as six years). In fact, BLM initially included the drill sites in the agencies’ consideration of alternatives. To the extent that ConocoPhillips intends to develop these drill sites, they should be evaluated among the alternatives so that these impacts can be understood in conjunction with the entirety of the project and so that less impactful alternatives and economies of scale may be considered for all of ConocoPhillips’ planned development."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"Do the right thing, listen to indigenous people, and protect our planet. Stop killing our environment, wildlife, and ecosystem."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The Willow Project would be a climate disaster. Arctic Alaska is already warming at nearly three times the rate of the rest of the continent.  Approving an oil and gas project that would add an estimated 250 million metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere would directly work against the administration’s climate goals."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I am writing to ask that you fully reanalyze ConocoPhillips' proposed Willow Master Development Plan. It would adversely impact caribou, migratory birds, and  Indigenous communities who rely on these lands and waters.  

The project would include a massive central processing facility, up to 250 wells on five gravel sites, and 40 miles of new roads. Significant portions of this project would occur within the globally significant Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, habitat that is critical for birds and other wildlife. 
The Department of the Interior must meaningfully consider the project's impacts to climate change. It's vital that the government comprehensively consider this harmful project's true costs to this irreplaceable and fragile area."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"While on the one hand BLM should be clear about the true scope of Willow and should not allow Conoco to piecemeal its proposal, BLM should also consider an alternative which would not authorize ConocoPhillips’ entire proposal (e.g., some drillsites but not others) in light of the potentially significant impacts to subsistence and other resources resulting from such a massive project. For example, BLM should consider a more protective alternative that eliminates BT-4 and BT-5 and restricts the footprint of what can ultimately be authorized for Willow, including Greater Willow. "

"ATT09","Request for New Analysis",,,"As the lead agency responsible for developing the EIS, BLM is obligated to obtain appropriate baseline data for the project area and to do a thorough analysis of potential impacts from the proposed project and its connected actions. Consistent with the requirements of NEPA, the Willow Plan EIS must evaluate ConocoPhillips’ proposed project using the relevant monitoring data and high quality, site-specific information on the project area.119
Full consideration will require analysis of adequate pre-project baseline studies as well as monitoring over the life of the project. BLM should determine what baseline studies have been completed and ensure that these data are available for public and peer review. "
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Any new environmental analysis of the Willow project must fully account for the project’s climate impacts. NEPA requires that agencies discuss not only a proposed action’s environmental effects, but also their significance.120 Therefore, in addition to accurately quantifying the GHG emissions consequences of the Willow project, BLM must put the project’s emissions in context."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,," In conducting this analysis, BLM must consider high quality and accurate climate science, including the most recent scientific information.123 BLM must also disclose what effect a decision to approve the Willow project would have on the United States’ commitments to limit warming to below 1.5°C. Moreover, BLM should do more than just consider this information. It can and should reach a decision that is in accordance with the science and the federal government’s commitment to respond to the climate crisis by selecting the no action alternative or delaying its consideration of the project."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Because any project’s emissions may appear “individually minor” when compared against global (or even national) totals, BLM should recognize that quantifying emissions is only a first step; BLM must also explain the Willow project’s “incremental impact” on climate change and disclose what effect BLM’s decision to authorize the project would have on the United States’ commitment to limit warming to below 1.5°C."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"BLM must look at Willow and other projects “in combination with each other,”175 to determine “‘whether, or how, to alter the program to lessen cumulative impacts’ on climate change.”176 CEQ’s Final Climate Guidance provides guidance on how federal agencies should address climate change in their NEPA analyses.177 The Final Climate Guidance applies to all federal agency actions 
subject to NEPA, “including land and resource management decisions.” 178 This guidance should be used by BLM in its reconsideration of the Willow project."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"Data are needed on the aquatic resources in the project area in order to adequately evaluate the impacts of the infrastructure and gravel mines. The lack of site-specific information about both the project and the aquatic resources that would be impacted was a significant gap in the last EIS. BLM and the Corps need to obtain additional baseline information about the aquatic resources, including information on wetland functions, that will be impacted by Willow. As part of the last NEPA process, there was also a significant gap in site-specific information about the water conditions at the location of the proposed Colville Crossing. BLM should ensure that additional, site-specific baseline data is gathered at the proposed crossing location to inform its analysis of that alternative. BLM should not rely on hypothetical or unrelated data sets, or yet-to-be-conducted monitoring, to determine if the Colville Crossing can be constructed and used in a manner that protects the environment and public safety. NEPA requires that that monitoring be done now, prior to evaluating the impacts of the crossing."
"RTTLSA","Teshekpuk Lake and other Special Areas",,,"If BLM considers an alternative involving Module Transfer Islands at Atigaru Point or Point Lonely again, we note that the transportation corridor from those islands pass directly through the area made unavailable for leasing or new non-subsistence infrastructure in the 2013 IAP ROD210 and areas subject to no surface occupancy, restricted surface use, or timing limitations under the 2020 IAP ROD.211 BLM must be very clear in the Willow Plan SEIS regarding what types of activities and infrastructure are contemplated in this area, such as ice roads and/or “module” storage. BLM must delineate precisely where and at what time of year industrial traffic and other activities will occur within the Special Area boundaries, and vigorously analyze the potential adverse impacts to wildlife and other resources. Additionally, given the stipulations for the Teshekpuk Lake Caribou Habitat Area that may require closure of the area during spring and summer, BLM needs to clearly lay out how ConocoPhillips will construct the road and the island consistent with the stipulations.
BLM must consider all potential direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of not only Willow’s infrastructure, but also the broader set of industrial activities in and adjacent to the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, including any summer work (past or future).212 BLM must thoroughly describe and analyze the impacts of these activities."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,,"The Teshekpuk Caribou Herd uses areas within and near the project area for overwintering, migration, calving, post-calving, and insect relief.284 Because no other caribou herd overwinters on the coastal plain, where Arctic oil and gas development has historically occurred in Alaska, no herd has previously been exposed to intensive development in its year-round range.285 The effects from this type of year-round exposure are potentially significant."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,,"When considering direct and indirect impacts, it is important that the potential for habituation to disturbance not be overstated, but that a realistic and science-based view be taken. There is not clear evidence for habituation of caribou to infrastructure. Recent work with migratory caribou in Canada showed that caribou continued to avoid even well-established infrastructure, leading the authors to suggest that long-term habituation was unlikely.304 Similarly, recent studies of the Central Arctic Herd, just to the east of the Reserve, found continued avoidance of infrastructure over a 40-year period, despite use of technology and infrastructure design intended to reduce impacts to caribou.305 This avoidance occurs not only during the calving and post-calving seasons, but also during mosquito harassment, when female caribou continue to avoid infrastructure more than expected by chance, despite insect effects."
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,,"The FEIS acknowledges that Willow presents “a potential for noise and/or physical human presence to cause female bears searching for den locations to be displaced or abandon a den with cubs,” but concludes that because much of Willow’s infrastructure is more than five miles from the coast that such impacts would be minimized.330 This overlooks the extensive amount of traffic and activities from Willow that would occur near the coast, and ignores the serious impacts that disturbance from traffic and other industrial activities would have on denning bears. The FEIS thus failed to analyze the potential for impacts to bears from human-bear encounters, despite such encounters being likely to occur. The SEIS must rectify this oversight."
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," Interior should contact and hold hearings for scoping and on the draft SEIS in all villages that desire a hearing, whether virtual or in-person depending upon the timing of such meetings and community preferences in light of COVID-19. Limiting public participation and public comment to only the submission of written comments may unfairly exclude and limit the ability of tribal entities and individuals to fully participate in this process, as some individuals such as elders may be limited in their ability to provide written comments or even verbal comments in the absence of a translator. However, BLM must address the technical issues and other problems that limited public participation in past virtual meetings prior to holding any future virtual event."
"TRI","Tribal Engagement",,,"FLPMA requires coordinating BLM planning and resource management with tribes and tribal land resource management programs, where appropriate and consistent with federal law.107
Interior and BLM must also adhere to the requirements found in Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments.108 On January 26, 2021, the President issued a “Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships” which seeks to prioritize regular, meaningful, and robust federal consultation with Tribal Nations and reaffirms and relies upon a similar Obama-era policy and Executive Order 13175. Interior also recently released a plan to improve Tribal consultations consistent with these
Executive Orders.109 The goals and policies outlines in these Orders and Interior’s plan should be followed for this SEIS process."
"TRI","Tribal Engagement",,,"It is critically important to honor the government-to-government relationship with all tribal entities that may be affected by Willow, meaning all tribes that rely upon the northeastern Reserve’s resources for subsistence, even if the tribe or tribal members are geographically distant from the project area. In Alaska, subsistence use regions span large geographic areas and subsistence resources include many migratory species like caribou, marine mammals, and waterfowl, as well as extensive food-sharing networks. Interior and BLM need to engage tribes and tribal members in all future steps the agencies plan to take, and ensure effective communication and informed Federal decision making that takes tribal concerns into consideration. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"under Section 302 of FLPMA, BLM may not authorize, and must “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation” of public lands.”258 If ConocoPhillips “cannot adequately mitigate impacts from the project, and BLM is, as a result, unable to achieve its resource and value objectives, then BLM may deny the land-use authorization in the decision document.”"
"ESA","ESA consultation and analysis",,,"To the extent BLM and FWS utilize modeling to assess the potential impacts to denning bears from disturbance, the agencies must ensure that modeling is accurate and does not downplay the likelihood of impacts. The recent Wilson and Durner study presents a model for quantitatively evaluating the impacts to denning mothers and cubs specifically on the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain from an area-wide seismic survey, taking into account the impact of mitigation measures such as time and place restrictions, and aerial infrared surveys to detect dens.333 While FWS used this model for purposes of assessing take in the Willow BiOp, the modeling approach and its results were never made available for public comment. If the agencies perform another quantitative model for the SEIS, the model, its results, and any analysis relied on in the model — published and unpublished — should be included in the draft SEIS so that the public has an opportunity to understand and comment on its implementation and results."
"ENPTCE","Cumulative Effects",,," In combination with the displacement occurring from other existing and proposed development on the North Slope, the impacts from Willow could be significant. BLM must take a hard look at the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Willow project on polar bears."
"REC","Reclamation",,,"Reclamation, including infrastructure and road removal, was barely discussed in the FEIS, which essentially states that infrastructure may or may not be simply left in place or removed.118  Reclamation is necessary for Willow, and BLM should ensure that all steps are taken to reclaim the area to its natural state."

•	Climate Change Analysis
•	Analysis of the Range of Alternatives
•	The biological opinion on the Polar Bears

Increased use of coastal habitat has led to a significant increase in the harassment of polar bears by humans.... Although the Willow FEIS acknowledged that increasing oil and gas activities in Alaska’s Arctic are happening concurrent with bears spending more time on land, leading to an increase in human-polar bear interactions, the FEIS did not consider the actual impacts to bears as a result of hazing. Instead, the FEIS concludes that “[d]espite the increase in human-bear interactions in existing oil fields in recent years, virtually no lethal take or injury of polar bears have been reported.”326 But this is contrary to evidence before the agency, and indeed, hazing does cause direct injury to polar bears. According to one oil company, hazing of polar bears at its facilities in and around the Beaufort Sea more than tripled in recent years compared to the three years prior, with 14 bears harassed in 2016 alone.327 Moreover, FWS determined that the Willow project is reasonably certain to cause direct injury of polar bears.328 The SEIS must consider these impacts.

Your Administration's action on the 'Willow' project is a crucible junction to determine whether you actually wish a different climate future, or will join the rest of America's business and political elite in liquidating the Earth for immediate economic gratification.

The recent IEA report confirms that no new fossil fuel reservoirs can be brought online within the carbon budget remaining to avoid climate catastrophe.

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Second, MarketSim contains misleading assumptions about substitution of energy supplies. As previously applied, MarketSim assumes that a large percentage of avoided oil and gas production under a no action alternative would be replaced by foreign oil imported into the U.S., which does not reflect the significantly decreasing trend in oil imports and results in an underestimate of the GHG emission reductions resulting from a no action alternative."
"RTTLSA","Teshekpuk Lake and other Special Areas",,,"BLM must also analyze the potential adverse effects to the Colville River Special Area. While BLM eliminated this Special Area in its 2020 IAP ROD,213 BLM is currently reconsidering that decision and could adopt the no-action alternative that re-instates this Special Area prior to a final decision on Willow. 214 As the Willow project was formerly proposed, a proposed mine site is adjacent to the Colville River Special Area and Willow’s proposed roads and pipelines would be within the Special Area under every alternative considered.215 Additionally, the Colville River Crossing alternative would cut through the Special Area.216 "

BLM allowed the project to move forward last time without detailed, site-specific information about how the project would ultimately be designed. BLM should not rely on generalized, “typical” examples of how ConocoPhillips will design project elements, such as culverts, in the future. It should provide clearer parameters for ensuring the project is designed to avoid altering the hydrology in the project area in the first place, and should include clear requirements for how problems will be identified and fixed if they arise in the future."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The damage that climate change is doing to our planet is becoming increasingly obvious. We do not need more fossil fuel burning to add more to the crisis. It is especially ironic to extract more oil from the Arctic, the region warming fastest, suffering from melting permafrost, eroding coastlines, habitat disruptions for the animals and plants, lifestyle disruptions for the peoples, and other devastating and permanent blows. The last thing the Arctic needs is more oil drilling."

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"I believe that the BLM needs to reflect to ensure that its goals are aligned with the Paris Climate Treaty and the numerous warnings of thousands of scientists Internationally to stop all new fossil fuel projects because of the problem of global warming and ecological and environmental destruction.  Primarily related to global warming, the Oil Change International Sky's Limit report in 2016 calculated that we have just about used up our entire carbon budget for safe stewardship of this planet and we need to put a moratorium on all new fossil fuel projects to safely steer our people into a realistic, sustainable future.  Also in accordance with the Paris Climate Treaty, the build-up of more fossil fuel infrastructure, especially in the heightened ecologically sensitive area of Alaska and the Arctic Circle, is contrary to common sense, good practice, and reason.  We need to accurately reflect and assume responsibility for the contribution to the global warming problem that this project presents.  All new fossil fuel infrastructure is contrary to the Paris Climate Treaty and our just transition to a renewable, sustainable future.  renewable and sustainable sources of energy can be made to work; we just need to provide the necessary realistic financial cutbacks to fossil fuel build out to release the competitive advantage of renewable and sustainable energy into the marketplace and allow the natural build-out of renewable and sustainable sources of energy.

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The Willow project is an oil and gas undertaking of massive scale, and if approved, it would almost certainly have a serious impact on the amount of polluting greenhouse gasses entering the atmosphere since it is the largest potential project of this type in the U.S. currently, and it would produce oil for more than 30 years. If this project is permitted to go through, it would pollute for years and years to come at a time when we should be moving away from a reliance on fossil fuels for the sake of the planet. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"This proposed Willow Master Development Plan poses many incredibly significant direct, indirect, and cumulative adverse impacts.  If implemented, this plan would forever industrialize a large area in the western Arctic of Alaska, causing massive wildlife habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation.

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"This would be morally reprehensible to continue "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"  Fossil fuel drilling and mining on public lands account for nearly a quarter of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The Willow project would pump nearly 600 million barrels of oil over 30 years — equivalent to the annual emissions of about a third of all coal plants in the U.S. This is unacceptable.
Those who support Willow because of its economic benefits for their communities are simply shortsighted. All the Alaska Congressional delegation can see is the Willow Project's projected $10 billion in revenue for state, local and federal governments during its lifespan, along with 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. They are ignoring the larger climate cost of this drilling project.

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"First, MarketSim erroneously assumes constant trends in energy demand and GHG emissions production. MarketSim analysis assumes that U.S. oil and gas production and GHG emissions will stay near constant through 2050. This is unreasonable and unrealistic, and results in underestimating the GHG emissions reductions resulting from a no action alternative.....An unrealistic assumption of near-constant high-volume oil and gas production and emissions over the next three decades is inconsistent with BLM’s obligation under NEPA to make assumptions that are reasonable and based on available information.191 In practice, this assumption significantly inflates the estimates of how much avoided oil production under a no action alternative would be substituted by fossil fuels, rather than by clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. This would lead to an underestimate of net emissions if the Willow project is constructed. BLM should instead model a baseline scenario that assumes that the U.S. and other countries meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement and transition to clean, renewable energy."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Fourth and finally, MarketSim uses a global warming potential (GWP) for methane that is outdated and significantly underestimates methane’s heating effects on the climate. Relatedly, MarketSim only uses the 100-year GWP rather than the more policy-relevant 20-year time frame for GWP. BLM must use the updated GWP from the authoritative IPCC over a 20-year time frame that is most policy-relevant for accurately assessing the impacts of the methane pollution"

In its GMT-1 decision, BLM found that there would be significant impacts to subsistence users and other values from the project that could not be fully mitigated by the stipulations and best-management practices in the 2013 IAP. To address those impacts, including major impacts to subsistence uses, BLM required additional compensatory mitigation funding from ConocoPhillips and required preparation of a Regional Mitigation Strategy (RMS).260....  BLM did not incorporate additional meaningful measures in the 2020 IAP and has yet to implement any aspect of the RMS. The prior Willow decision did not go far enough in mitigating, let alone adequately analyzing, the serious impacts of the project on the community of Nuiqsut. BLM needs to address these deficiencies in the new SEIS and develop stronger mitigation measures for this hugely impactful project."
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"BLM must also consider new mitigation measures specific to the Willow Plan that will help to avoid, minimize, and compensate for adverse effects to resources.  We encourage the agency to work closely with Nuiqsut in crafting these measures. All mitigation should be meaningful in its ability to address adverse impacts, and measurable in its effectiveness. "

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"  The Willow project needs to have a sweeping review of Willow's climate effects, including its greenhouse gas emissions.   The projected revenue to the state of Alaska needs to NOT be the only consideration.  The overall climate impact to the entire Earth needs to be assessed.  We need to move off fossil fuels, not keep drilling for more of it."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,,"BLM should also carefully consider the effects of proposed infrastructure on caribou migration and movement, and access to preferred habitat. Impediments to migration can have strong negative effects on ungulate populations,296 making it very important that presence of infrastructure and industrial activities in movement corridors be analyzed and mitigation measures adopted to minimize impacts. Consideration of caribou migratory pathways from collared animals using this area (including those from other Arctic herds), observations from subsistence hunters in Nuiqsut and other traditional knowledge holders, and recent scientific studies of caribou response to infrastructure297 should be considered in evaluating the impacts of infrastructure and development activities. BLM should also consider recent analyses of site fidelity among caribou and caribou herds, which focused on caribou in the Reserve."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,,"any influences of climate-induced shifts to habitat and phenology (environmental timing) that might affect use by caribou should be considered by BLM for their potential effects on caribou coming into contact with oil and gas exploration and development. Accordingly, BLM should carefully evaluate the relative habitat-quality of areas that may be disturbed by the project."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,,"BLM must also evaluate the potential impacts from construction, drilling, operation, and eventual reclamation of Willow infrastructure on other species of terrestrial mammals and their habitats. "
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,," BLM must analyze how the presence of a new airstrip and shifting aircraft patterns may disturb or displace terrestrial mammals. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"  Please do not allow the Willow project to move forward.

The melting permafrost in these regions will not support the infrastructure such as construction and pipelines, possible leading to oil line breaks and spills."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I am writing to ask you to stop ConocoPhillips’ Western Arctic drilling plan."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," This is yet another parasitic invasion of Indigenous ecological areas.  The costs surely outweigh the temporary benefits it supposes.

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"We should be ending all oil and gas drilling projects and not starting new ones if we are to save ourselves and the planet from climate catastrophe.

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," Invest in and support renewable research and projects instead! "
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,,"Significant impacts to marine mammals will be caused by acoustic disturbance and displacement from vessel traffic and construction to upgrade the dock. Additional impacts would occur due to traffic onshore, including in polar bear critical habitat, and annual construction of an ice bridge across the Colville River. Marine mammals would also be significantly impacted by Willow’s GHG emissions, which would exacerbate impacts from climate change already being felt in the project area and well beyond. These impacts must be fully considered under NEPA and other relevant laws applicable to marine mammals."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"Relatedly, the EIS should not solely consider alternatives where the company transports pre-fabricated project components to the North Slope in modules. To fulfill NEPA’s requirements to consider a reasonable range of alternatives, BLM should compare the tradeoffs in impacts by considering an alternative that would require ConocoPhillips to construct Willow at the project location, as was done for Alpine and other oil and gas facilities nearby."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"The Willow Plan EIS must analyze how the Willow project will significantly fragment the landscape of the northeastern Reserve. Emphasis should be placed on the movement of wildlife, particularly caribou, across the landscape and how aquatic systems and flows will be altered by gravel mining, gravel road development, ice road and pad development, and the construction of infrastructure.  Industrial development and activity may also fragment the landscape for subsistence hunters and other natural resource users. Habitat fragmentation should be considered when analyzing the impacts to both ecological and social values, and should also be studied within the cumulative effects analysis. Additionally, how fragmentation will impact the values and biological and physical properties of the Teshekpuk Lake and Colville River Special Areas must be thoroughly analyzed."
"ENPTA8A","ANILCA 810 Analysis",,,"Construction and operation of Willow, which will connect back to and magnify the amount of industrial activity in the region, will adversely affect subsistence resources and will significantly restrict subsistence use even further. BLM should provide a thorough discussion of whether the alternatives considered in the SEIS do, in fact, involve the minimal amount of public lands necessary to accomplish the purpose of the use and a thorough analysis of what steps it anticipates taking to minimize the adverse impacts to subsistence uses and resources, as required by ANILCA section 810."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"In sum, BLM is obligated to ensure that it prepares an EIS that fully complies with NEPA and other applicable laws, and should not limit its review to the legal issues identified by the Court. BLM must apply the same level of NEPA analysis as required under the 1978 NEPA regulations in effect prior to the Council for Environmental Quality’s September 2020 revision. "
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"Within a week of taking office, President Biden signed an executive order that announced his commitment to protecting 30% of U.S. land and water — over 720 million acres — by 2030.279 On May 6, Interior, in conjunction with other resource management agencies and departments, published Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful, a preliminary report about the “30 by 30 plan.”280 In achieving 30 by 30, there is no single area of public land that can contribute more acreage to the 30% goal than the Reserve. Permitting Willow — with its proposed spiderweb of gravel roads, pads, airports, ice roads and bridges, massive central processing facility, and its function as a catalyst to further westward development in the Reserve — is plainly inconsistent with the goal of conserving and restoring the health and productivity of our nation’s lands and waters. BLM must fully consider how Willow will impact biodiversity in the northeastern Reserve and outside of its boundaries, and explain whether and how Willow is consistent with national goals regarding conservation and restoration."
"ENPTCE","Cumulative Effects",,,"The speed of development in and adjacent to the Reserve is staggering. Oil and gas development and associated industrial activities in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, Harrison Bay, and nearby state lands are encircling Nuiqsut. BLM must fully analyze the potentially significant adverse effects of the Willow Plan on culture, subsistence, public health, and environmental justice in the context of this rapidly increasing development. "
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"BLM is also obligated to ensure the Colville River Special Area is provided with maximum protections. There was a lack of site-specific baseline and other information about ConocoPhillips’ proposed Colville River crossing as part of the prior approval process, including if there will be grounded ice at the time of the crossing, if there will be free-water pockets, how large those pockets will be, and the extent to which the area may be used by overwintering fish. BLM needs to obtain additional information about that proposal and ensure that the area is adequately protected. "
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,,"ConocoPhillips’ onshore and offshore activities, including barging of its proposed modules, will likely result in the taking of protected marine mammals, and GHG emissions from Willow will exacerbate climate change impacts that are already being felt by marine mammals. BLM should not authorize any activities for Willow until FWS and NMFS have thoroughly analyzed the impacts to marine mammals and determined whether the MMPA permits them to authorize the take of marine mammals that will occur as a result of ConocoPhillips’ activities. If take is anticipated, it must be authorized under the MMPA before FWS or NMFS may permit such take under the ESA.48 In addition to FWS and NMFS’s assessments, NEPA requires BLM to independently analyze potential impacts to marine mammals from ConocoPhillips’ proposed activities."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"It is troubling that BLM is preparing a supplemental NEPA analysis instead of a revised DEIS, and that it is moving forward without first holding a scoping period."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"BLM did not provide the public and affected tribes and communities, particularly Nuiqsut, with a sufficiently detailed project description or an adequate amount of time to generate constructive comments, despite requests for additional time and information."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,," The NPRPA provides that BLM “shall include or provide for such conditions, restrictions, and prohibitions” on activities within the Reserve as it determines necessary to protect the Reserve’s surface resources.28 The statute places no limitation or conditions on this authority. Indeed, BLM has considerable discretion to suspend all operations on existing leases or units.29 Under the NPRPA, BLM may suspend operations and production “in the interest of conservation of natural resources” or to mitigate “reasonably foreseeable and significantly adverse effects on surface resources.”"
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"BLM should also describe whether and how the Willow Plan SEIS will be used to
assist other agencies with permitting authority for the project to comply with their own statutory obligations, namely the Clean Water Act (CWA)."
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,," BLM cannot authorize any action that may affect a protected species or its designated critical habitat without first consulting with either FWS for polar bears and eiders, or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for whales and seals."
"RTMAMA","Marine Mammals",,,"Interior, acting through BLM and FWS, must address how it will complete consultation for polar bears in a manner that complies with the ESA for Willow. BLM must also ensure that consultation considers not only the impacts to ESA-listed species and their federally designated habitat from noise, traffic, oil spills, hazing, and other local impacts associated with the construction and operation of the Willow project, but also the impacts of the GHG emissions caused by the project on species threatened by climate change."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"The requirements for BLM under FLPMA are clear: BLM must not issue a right-of-way that will do unnecessary damage to the environment.49 BLM is obligated to carefully consider the requirements in FLPMA and include terms and conditions for the Willow right-of-way that: protect federal property and economic interests; efficiently manage the right-of-way and lands adjacent to it; protect the interests of people living in the area who rely on fish, wildlife, and biotic resources for their subsistence lifestyle; locate the right-of-way along the least environmentally damaging route; and otherwise protect the public interest in lands traversed by the right-of-way or adjacent thereto"
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"The requirement that BLM “protect the public interest in the lands traversed by the right-of way or adjacent thereto” makes it clear that BLM is responsible for protecting environmental resources beyond the immediate project area and values outside the Reserve’s boundaries, including the climate. Impacts to subsistence in nearby communities such as Nuiqsut and Anaktuvuk Pass, negative impacts to wetlands in the region, and downstream hydrological impacts from water crossings must be fully analyzed in determining whether granting a right-of-way for Willow is in the public interest."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"We strongly urge Interior to review the legality of its decision to issue the prior right-of-way for Willow under the MLA. If BLM ultimately issues a right-of-way to ConocoPhillips’ for Willow, it should do so under its FLPMA authority and ensure the agency’s statutory obligations are met under that statute."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"Given the prevalence of jurisdictional wetlands throughout the Willow project area, the Corps has broad permitting responsibilities and mitigation obligations related to this project that need to be fully reconsidered in the SEIS and a new permitting process. As described in more detail below, the Court found that the EIS improperly constrained its consideration of alternatives. Because of this, the Corps should rescind the prior 404 permit, require a new application from ConocoPhillips, and assess whether there is a less environmentally damaging practicable alternative that was not fully considered in the prior permitting process. Additionally, both BLM and the Corps should require ConocoPhillips to submit complete, new applications for Willow to clarify what the agencies are collectively considering authorizing for this project. "
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"The Corps’ approval was also inconsistent with what BLM considered and approved in the FEIS and ROD since BLM did not ultimately authorize the BT4 and BT5 pads, but the Corps did. BLM and the Corps need to rectify this disconnect in the new SEIS and in what they are requiring from ConocoPhillips to ensure both agencies are evaluating the same version of the project. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"There should also be a robust and transparent analysis of needed compensatory mitigation, and close coordination with other federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and FWS in determining the appropriate calculation for impacted aquatic resources and associated mitigation debits and credits. In the prior permitting process, the Corps violated the CWA because it lacked sufficient information about the project’s design and functions of wetlands in the project area to determine that Willow’s effects would not cause significant degradation of aquatic resources. The Corps also lacked information to conclude that all appropriate and practicable steps would be taken to minimize Willow’s adverse effects, and failed to ensure ConocoPhillips’ proposed mitigation adequately offset impacts — only requiring compensatory mitigation for a small fraction of Willow’s footprint.57 As part of this new process, the Corps should rectify the problems with its previous compensatory mitigation requirements and ensure that Willow’s impacts to waters and wetland functions are fully considered and mitigated."
"PETPD","Project Description",,,"We encourage BLM to include a robust discussion of the approvals and authorizations of other federal, state, and local agencies for Willow. BLM should ensure the SEIS contains necessary information for these agencies to analyze the project pursuant to their individual permitting requirements and statutory mandates."
"ENPTCE","Cumulative Effects",,,"The prior EIS also failed to fully consider the cumulative impacts of Willow as a hub for future oil and gas activities, both by ConocoPhillips and other oil and gas companies. Westward development spurred by Willow would significantly impact Special Areas and local communities."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I’d like to  express my disagreement with the Willow project. The last thing we need is more oil and gas, making climate change worse, while destroying fragile habitat, which will eventually sink into the permafrost. I hope you’ll decline this project."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"BLM should rigorously evaluate and consider adopting the no action alternative. Given the severity of the climate emergency and the administration’s commitments to address it.77 BLM must thoroughly consider, and should select, the no action alternative. The no action alternative would also avoid significant, permanent harm to the community of Nuiqsut, avoiding the myriad environmental justice, public health, sociocultural, and subsistence impacts from Willow. As the District Court and Ninth Circuit found, the harms to Nuiqsut subsistence users from a single season of winter construction activities would have been significant and irreparable."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"BLM should consider an alternative with the following components: winter season only drilling, which eliminates the need for gravel roads, greatly reducing the project footprint and gravel mine size; the use of directional drilling to minimize the number and size of pads;89 locating infrastructure to avoid the most sensitive areas, particularly eliminating infrastructure within Special Area boundaries and Nuiqsut’s subsistence use areas; and minimizing the impacts of aviation on subsistence activities and resources."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"Moreover, ConocoPhillips has a history of piecemealing its applications to conceal the full breadth of impacts of its projects, as demonstrated by the fact it applied for GMT-1 shortly after permitting was complete for CD-5, and GMT-2 shortly after the GMT-1 ROD. BLM cannot arbitrarily deem certain future drill sites as alternatives components and others as possible cumulative effects when sufficient information exists to evaluate them all now. The SEIS must explain what components of the project and ConocoPhillips’ expected development are being considered through this process and how the BLM’s approach to alternatives complies with NEPA."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,," Additionally, in its ROD, BLM did not authorize the BT-4 and BT-5 pads, despite having analyzed those as part of the project and alternatives, and stated those sites may be authorized at a future time after a to-be-determined future process. BLM is obligated under NEPA to consider connected and similar actions91 — not solely the project components ConocoPhillips’ requests be considered"
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,," Groups pointed out that BLM’s draft EIS was so deficient that the agency needed to substantially revise and re-release it for public comment. Groups specifically explained that BLM failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives, failed to acknowledge and address considerable missing information, failed to adequately analyze the project’s direct, indirect and cumulative impacts, and failed to properly evaluate mitigation measures."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"we all know better than to continue to damage the environment in ways past generations did not understand.  Actually, we have known better for a long time but pretended not to know.  Now we also know that the consequences are much worse and are impacting us faster than most of us ever imagined.  That is why we must stop ConocoPhillips’ disastrous Western Arctic drilling plan."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"The climate crisis is now and it is time to act to stop the damage to our environment.  "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," The Arctic has been in decline and it is widely known that Polar Bears and other wildlife are endangered with this ever changing climate crisis. Once further damaged, which this proposal will certainly do, compounded by the currant climate crisis, damages will be irreversible. "
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"As a threshold matter, BLM and the Corps need to ensure they have complete applications and site-specific information about what ConocoPhillips is proposing for this project. As discussed above, ConocoPhillips repeatedly changed its proposal and the location of project elements throughout the prior environmental review process. ConocoPhillips also did not submit its permit application to the Corps until right before the release of the prior SEIS and did not submit its APDs and right-of-way application until after the completion of the FEIS. The shifting project proposal and lack of clarity in the prior process made it wholly unclear what ConocoPhillips was proposing and what the agencies were authorizing. This also led to the agencies issuing inconsistent decisions, with the Corps, but not BLM, approving the BT-4 and BT-5 pads. The agencies must have complete, site-specific information about the project to ensure they are able to adequately analyze impacts."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"The FEIS also lacked detail on the project’s proposed bridges and other water crossings, including culverts and the proposed ice bridge over the Colville River. ConocoPhillips’ project designs were based on “typical” culverts and road sections, but failed to take into account site-specific conditions that could alter the effectiveness and design of those measures. This is particularly troubling, given that the FEIS acknowledged there was a significant chance the culverts would fail or not function properly during their lifetime and would cause alterations to surface flows and natural drainage patterns. BLM and the Corps need additional, site-specific information about the proposed designs and aquatic resources to adequately analyze and mitigate those impacts. The FEIS’s prior analysis of the impacts to aquatic resources was so generalized as to be completely meaningless and reflects the agencies lack of site-specific information and baseline conditions necessary to engage in an adequate analysis. This needs to be rectified in the SEIS."
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," BLM must ensure that the proposed administrative process allows for robust public participation by the interested public, local communities, and tribal entities"
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"Rather than encouraging and facilitating public involvement and scrutiny, as NEPA requires, BLM’s prior process to approve Willow was confusing and suppressed public engagement. Such an approach should not be repeated for this supplemental process."
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"Groups requested multiple times that the public comment period be suspended to allow for appropriate public engagement and oversight as required by law. BLM ignored these reasonable requests, and moved ahead with a short public comment period that did not allow for meaningful public input. BLM also held virtual meetings that constrained public participation and gave the agency overwhelming power to determine who could speak and which questions were addressed."
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"BLM’s timeframes for review of the SEIS must allow for meaningful public involvement. We are concerned that BLM’s decision to forgo a formal scoping period, may indicate that the agency does not intend to allow time for public involvement in the SEIS process. Ensuring that the public has sufficient time to receive and review all of the documents and understand their relationship to what is being proposed is essential to the public’s ability to analyze and provide meaningful comments. The State of Alaska, a cooperating agency in this process, has indicated that BLM plans to issue a ROD approving Willow by the end of this year to allow for construction during the first quarter of 2023.101 Rushing the analysis and public review is not consistent with BLM’s obligations when considering an issue as important, controversial, and destructive as Willow."
"ENPTCE","Cumulative Effects",,,"BLM also did not adequately consider impacts from future drill sites such as Greater Willow 1 or 2. BLM must be clear at the outset of this process exactly what it is analyzing and whether such project components would be approved in the future or are properly part of this proposal. BLM should not consider as part of ConocoPhillips’ proposed action only those future drill pads that ConocoPhillips requested be evaluated."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"Given the significance of the Willow project’s GHG emissions in the context of the worsening climate crisis, BLM should select the no action alternative."
"ENPTPER","Permitting",,,"Alternatively, BLM may consider delaying any permitting for the project until a plan can be implemented for a declining rate of production throughout the Reserve over time that provides for an orderly phase-out of fossil fuel production consistent with declining rates of GHG emissions necessary to avoid 1.5°C warming. As described above, there is no room in the global carbon budget for the Willow project. Either of these choices would be consistent with BLM’s broad management authority and obligations in the Reserve,200 and would be consistent with this administration’s commitments to address the climate crisis."

• Focus exclusively on the issues specifically identified in the District Court review as needing further analysis (Climate change analysis - Foreign Emissions, Range of Alternatives analysis and Aspects of US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) Biological opinion). The remainder of the document need not be re-addressed, nor should previously non-existent elements be included for consideration.
• That the voice of local Alaskan Stakeholders, Residents, Tribes, and Subject Matter Experts be prioritized in considering the additional measures being required of the Project.
• That the review and approval of the SEIS be sufficiently expedited so that that installation of project materials can commence during the 2022-2023 winter construction season."
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"After due examination, Alaska Maritime Agencies looks forward to the completion of the SEIS, and the final approval of Willow Project. We feel it is the step in the right direction for Alaska’s economy, US energy independence, and maintaining a robust petroleum inventory. This is especially important now, as sources of foreign energy may soon be restricted, and rising fuel prices are affecting all Americans.

ConocoPhillips has consistently demonstrated their capacity for resource development with a minimal impact to the environment. We are confident that they will continue to maintain these high standards for the Willow Project."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I urge you to take all possible steps to halt the Willow drilling project! I am deeply concerned about climate change and support President Biden's commitments to rapidly reducing our climate impact. This project is totally incompatible with those goals and will contribute to the destructive effect of climate change on Americans. Go back to the drawing board; advance a proposal that will protect [incomprehensible] beautiful state and our climate."
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"The Willow Project would provide a needed injection of capital, resources, and jobs into Alaska’s economy. It could support up to 2,000 jobs during construction and hundreds of stable, long-term jobs during operation. According to the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) own estimates show that it would generate over $2.1 billion for the State of Alaska in production, property, and income taxes, and $2.6 billion over its project life for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) Impact Mitigation Grant Program. These grant funds would benefit North Slope Borough governments and support municipal operations, community projects, and youth development programs, all of which are essential to the region’s long-term growth and economic vitality."
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"The revenue Alaska receives from this project will also allow our rural communities to receive continued support for schools, health clinics, and basic public services like water and sewer treatments. ARA also wishes to emphasize the high standards to which this project has been held. The final plan submitted to BLM in 2019 reliably meets all 270 mitigation and best practices currently in place for the NPR-A. In developing this plan, project leaders facilitated over 140 days of public comment, a public scoping period, and 13 in-person public meetings in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Nuiqsut, Atqasuk, and Anaktuvuk Pass."
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"These alterations, and the local government decisions that sprung from them, demonstrate the broad community support for the Willow Project.

As we stated in our last comment letter in May 2020, delaying the Willow Project would compromise America’s long-term goal for energy security as well as delay substantial benefits to the State of Alaska and local stakeholders. BLM should proceed with timely issuing the final SEIS and ultimately approving development of the Willow Project."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"I oppose the Willow project because, if
approved, Willow will produce staggering amounts of greenhouse gas es for 30 years. The
UN IPCC 2022 report warns that the effects of climate change are growing faster and more
severe than expected. We have little time to meet the targets of time the Paris Agreement
and avert catastrophic global heating. Instead of permitting a massive oil drilling project in
the Arctic, we should be making the transition to 100% clean energy economy."

your evaluation must certainly take into account that the Arctic is essential to the cooling of the
entire planet, and continuing to warm the Arctic will have catastrophic effects for the entire planet
and all of life on this planet.

Permafrost thaws release methane which causes temperatures to rise, and the faster temperatures
rise the faster the permafrost thaws in an unstoppable cycle increasing exponentially to
temperatures well above the 1.5 C threshold which would unleash severe climate effects on
humans, wildlife and ecosystems."
"ATT09","Request for New Analysis",,,"But in addition to the warming effects of methane release from the permafrost your evaluation must
seriously consider the methane leaks are constant at every drilling site in the extraction of gas and
oil, in every pipeline for the transport of gas and oil, and in the processing of crude.

It is critical that this warming of the Arctic be considered very seriously and it is crucial that your
evaluation of the effects of the proposed Willow project on the Western Arctic and on the planet
include a thorough analysis of the warming effects of methane. Methane has 80 times the warming
power of CO2 in its first 20 years of release into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has a longer lasting
effect, but methane has immediate effects - and thus methane is setting the pace for warming of our
planet - now."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"President Biden made a commitment to adequately and effectively
address the climate crisis. The Willow project is one of the single

that it will add more than 250 million metric tones of CO2 over the
next 30 years, and of course releasing untold quantities of methane
at the same time which will have even more immediate lethal effects
than the CO2. This is staggering. And the Biden administration can
only achieve its climate goals if it absolutely and unequivocally
rejects the Willow project."

"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"we want to acknowledge BLM’s decision to
undertake a more inclusive and open public scoping process. Kuukpik was concerned that the
previous unofficial “scoping” process would not facilitate broad participation, was being carried
out without basic information on potential new alternatives, and was being rushed to try to help
Conoco receive a decision in time for the 2022-2023 winter construction season. BLM’s
decision to take a step back and engage in a more normal scoping and NEPA process suggests a
commitment to doing this process right rather than just doing it fast, which Kuukpik appreciates."
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Kuukpik believes the
Supplemental EIS should examine, at a minimum, (i) Conoco’s Alternative B, (ii) Conoco’s
Alternative BT2N, (iii) Kuukpik’s Northern Satellite Drill Site Alternative, and (iv) the 3 drill
site version of Willow BLM approved in the 2020 Record of Decision (ROD)."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,," Kuukpik believes the
Supplemental EIS should examine, at a minimum, (i) Conoco’s Alternative B, (ii) Conoco’s
Alternative BT2N, (iii) Kuukpik’s Northern Satellite Drill Site Alternative, and (iv) the 3 drill
site version of Willow BLM approved in the 2020 Record of Decision (ROD)."
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"Kuukpik has long urged BLM to examine an alternative where the northernmost Willow
drill site is not connected by road to the other Willow drill sites (like CD-3 is not connected to
the other Alpine drill sites). BLM declined to examine that alternative under the previous
administration and before the U.S. District Court remanded the EIS to BLM to consider, among
other things, alternatives that would reduce impacts in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area
(TLSA). In light of the District Court’s order, and the shortcomings of Alternative BT2N that
will obviously be used against it (such as the inability to reach all the resource Conoco wants to
extract), it now seems even more obvious that the second Supplemental EIS should examine a
Northern Satellite Drill Site alternative.

A Northern Satellite Drill Site alternative would not only comply with the Court’s order,
it might allow Conoco to access more oil than their proposed Alternative BT2N. Constructing
the northernmost drill site as a satellite would eliminate about 9 miles of road and over 300,000
cubic yards of gravel from the TLSA compared to Alternative B. There is simply no reasonable
argument that, at a conceptual level, a drill site that could be constructed with 9 fewer miles of
gravel road in the TLSA would reduce impacts to caribou in the TLSA, which is precisely the
kind of analysis the District Court will want to see when this SEIS ends up back in court.[2]

But perhaps just as important, a northern satellite drill site could likely be constructed
farther north than the proposed BT2N drill site, which would likely allow Conoco to reach more
oil in the northern reaches of the TLSA than Alternative BT2N. A northern drill site with no
permanent gravel road connection could probably be built closer to Conoco’s original proposed
BT4 location because the impacts from locating the drill site in a more sensitive area (to the
north) should be offset by completely eliminating the road. So the Northern Satellite Drill Site
alternative might very well achieve what we’re all looking for: reduced impacts on caribou
and within the TLSA, and more complete access to the resource. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"Effectively comparing just two alternatives would not satisfy NEPA’s legal requirements
or goals of examining a full range of alternatives, particularly on a Project of this magnitude.[4]
Including Kuukpik’s proposal along with Conoco’s second proposal makes the SEIS more likely
to survive the inevitable court challenge than just analyzing Alternative BT2N. And more to
Kuukpik’s concerns, including other alternatives is more likely to result in a preferred alternative
where everyone can win: Conoco gets more oil, BLM survives a court challenge, and subsistence
hunters and community members in Nuiqsut are not unnecessarily impacted."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"Kuukpik would also like to see an analysis of the version of Willow that BLM approved
in the 2020 Record of Decision. If BLM doesn’t analyze that alternative, this process could
result in a step backward rather than an improvement if it undoes one of the good outcomes of
the previous NEPA process: the decision to authorize only three of the proposed five originally
proposed drill sites. Only one of those drill sites was in the TLSA, and it was farther south and
in a less sensitive area than the northernmost drill site in Alternative BT2N. So in some ways,
the three drill site Willow Project that was approved in BLM’s ROD – standing alone, and
without taking into account the other two drill sites that could have been approved later – may
actually be preferable to the four drill site Alternative BT2N Conoco is suggesting now.

It would be ironic (and bad form) if the court’s remand and instruction to develop a new
alternative focused on reducing impacts in the TLSA resulted in BLM approving an alternative
that includes more drill sites than the previous ROD, not less, one of which is in a more sensitive
area farther north than the previously approved northernmost site. Kuukpik isn’t saying we
would oppose Alternative BT2N on that basis alone; we never take a position on new
alternatives until the EIS is complete. But if BLM intends not to take a step backward, the SEIS
should include an analysis of the three drill site Alternative that BLM approved in the ROD.
This would not only provide a lower impact development alternative for analysis than
Alternative B (thereby filling out a better range of alternatives for comparison), it would be the
first analysis of the version of the Project BLM actually approved in 2020. Legally and
practically, that alternative should be included in the SEIS if BLM wants to preserve the ability
to make the same decision it made last time and so stakeholders can more accurately compare any new alternatives to the three drill site alternative that should serve as the baseline or floor for
any future project approval."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"The Conoco developed
Alternative BT2N includes several significant changes to the original Alternative B
that Conoco clearly wants to include in the Project, and which they will urge BLM to include in
the Preferred Alternative (whatever that may be). These include elements like eliminating a
standalone Willow Mud Plant in favor of processing mud at the Kuukpik Pad and processing oil
produced at GMT2 at Willow. These and other changes will significantly affect estimates for
things like vehicle and truck traffic and water usage. But BLM cannot analyze whether these
proposed changes have more or less impacts than Conoco’s original proposal without
understanding how each proposed change affects the estimated impacts. So the SEIS should
analyze, for example, how many additional mud and chemical delivery truck trips between K
Pad and Willow will be generated if Conoco is allowed to expand the current K Pad mud plant
instead of simply building one right next to the Willow facility. Otherwise, BLM will not know
which of those features to include in a preferred alternative.
"
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"Big picture, failing to individually account for the
different impacts of significant design changes would make it difficult or impossible to
accurately compare the existing Alternatives with any new alternatives, including Alternative
BT2N and a Northern Satellite Drill Site Alternative. As just one example, we note that Table
2.10-1 of Conoco’s EED (p. 2-66) states that Alternative B will require approximately 3,188,910
one-way vehicle trips over the life of the field. It states that BT2N would require about fortythree
thousand less. This might be viewed as a pretty minor difference in vehicle trips over a 30
year period, and might lead decisionmakers to think that eliminating an entire drill site does not
have a significant impact on vehicle traffic.[5] But there are other design changes in Alternative BT2N that could account for the relatively similar traffic estimate, such as the proposal to
process drilling mud at K Pad instead of Willow---a proposal that would require all the drilling
mud to be trucked between those two locations. In short, there’s no way to know what impact
consolidating BT2 and BT4 into BT2N has on vehicle traffic without determining, at a
minimum, what impact changing the mud plant has on that same estimate. "
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"Kuukpik believes that many of the vehicle trips that would be avoided by eliminating
BT4 would be added back into the Project if CPAI processes drilling mud almost 30 miles away
at K Pad because the latter requires transporting all that mud 30 miles to Willow by truck.7
Worse still, that truck traffic would be heavy duty vac trucks right through the heart of some of
Nuiqsut’s most heavily used subsistence areas along the GMT1 and GMT2 road. This is not
only a substantive problem that needs to be examined (since BLM could design a preferred
alternative that looks similar to BT2N but requires mud to be processed at Willow instead of K
Pad), it prevents an “apples to apples” comparison between Alternatives B and BT2N. Only
Alternative BT2N includes the very roughly 1,217 vehicle trips that would be caused solely by
Conoco’s new proposal to process mud at K Pad, which makes Alternative BT2N look worse by
comparison for reasons that are wholly unrelated to the main design difference of consolidating
BT2 and BT4 into BT2N. That’s misleading.

Again, the point isn’t that 1,217 additional vehicle trips is, by itself, a determinative
factor between two alternatives; but rather, that failing to at least try to account for differences in
impacts caused by major design differences between alternatives makes it that much harder to
conduct an “apples to apples” comparison. The SEIS needs to analyze the differences between
processing locations if stakeholders are to understand which location would have fewer impacts. Kuukpik believes processing at Willow is likely to be preferable, but only a detailed analysis in
the SEIS can say for sure."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"The EED attempts to take that position, stating that the new mud processing location will cause a
“minor” reduction in construction traffic and a “minor” increase in drilling truck traffic. EED, p. 4. This
partly illustrates Kuukpik’s point: we can’t be satisfied with just characterizing the differences as
“minor”, because who knows that that means? We want to see the data to support CPAI’s statement so
we can evaluate it for ourselves, determine if it is realistic, and then decide for ourselves whether the
changes are “minor”. That’s part of the point of the public process. Having said that, we acknowledge
that the proposal to process mud at the K Pad may reduce some impacts by eliminating construction
traffic to Willow that would otherwise be necessary to construct the standalone mud plant there. But the question is whether that short-term decrease is offset or outweighed by the increased and longer-term
traffic needed to support drilling operations between K Pad and Willow. We suspect it is, but need to see
the data to reach a definitive conclusion."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"We have a similar question regarding anticipated air traffic. The reduction in fixed wing flights between
Alternative B and BT2N is negligible in the grand scheme of the Willow Project, only about 118 flights.
Given Alternative BT2N’s somewhat smaller construction and operating scope, we would have expected
the reduction in flights to be more significant. This is another instance where more specific information is
needed if we are to understand what specific project elements are contributing to the flight total under
each alternative. That will allow stakeholders to identify the specific elements from each alternative that
result in fewer flights and, ideally, combine those elements into a preferred alternative.
[7] Kuukpik estimates that something like 1 vehicle trip every 3 days will be needed on average to
transport drilling muds and fluids between Willow and the K Pad for a 2 rig drilling program. That’s 121
vehicle trips per year during the 7-10 year drilling period at Willow, totaling approximately 1,217 vehicle
trips between Willow and the K Pad that are caused by the proposal to process mud at K Pad instead of
Willow."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"The same goes for the other major design changes that are included (or omitted) in
Alternative BT2N, but which are unrelated to the major change in drill site location. These
include processing GMT2 oil at Willow, eliminating the CFWR[8], locating BT5 further east[9], and
building a diesel pipeline from CD1 to Willow (a design feature that is included in Alternatives
C and D, but not in B or BT2N).[10] These differences between these design elements are
significant enough individually and cumulatively to distort the comparison between alternatives.
Each of them could --- and should --- also be “mixed and matched” with other elements to create
a preferred alternative that has the lowest possible impact. These elements therefore need to be
analyzed and accounted for, very specifically. "
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," it’s not just the raw numbers of vehicle trips or
flights that matters; location matters to Kuukpik and Nuiqsut. A vehicle trip between Willow
and GMT2 will not have nearly the same impact on subsistence hunters or Kuukpik-owned land
as a trip between Willow and K-Pad or Willow and Alpine. So Kuukpik and Nuiqsut might be
able to support an alternative with similar or even more total vehicle trips if those trips were
predominantly outside our most heavily used subsistence lands. It would be helpful for the SEIS
to not just estimate how many total trips will occur under each alternative, but estimate where those trips will occur and to show that information with more detail than NEPA documents have
in the past."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," The EED doesn’t explain why Alternative BT2N doesn’t require a CFWR. We hope the EIS will
explain the rationale for that, in addition to providing some of the more detailed information on the
anticipated different impacts between using or not using the CFWR (which we realize is articulated in the
first Supplemental EIS to some degree, but may need to be refreshed and specified in context in order to
facilitate a thorough understanding of the issue)."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"See EED, p. 2-53. Describing BT2N, the EED states “BT5 would be located east of the location
proposed for other action alternatives to avoid two yellow-billed loon nest setbacks, which would also
reduce the length of the BT5 road and infield pipelines.” Kuukpik would like to understand if BLM
and Conoco intend to make this change regardless of what alternative is selected, whether there are
any other consequences from that change, and what specific changes in pipeline and road lengths
would occur."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," The truck trips needed to haul diesel out to Willow would likely be significantly more than those
needed to haul drilling muds. For context, Kuukpik believes approximately 3.5 million gallons of diesel
was used to support Alpine operations in 2003. Trucking that amount of diesel to Willow would require
somewhere around 490 tanker trips per year, or 1.3 round trips per day. The number is likely higher for
the larger Willow Project. Nearly all these trips could be avoided if a diesel line to Willow is constructed."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"Willow is far enough west of Nuiqsut that a certain amount of air traffic to and
from the Project (or between the Project and a roadless satellite) might be preferable to impacts
on the ground that are closer to home or which threaten the migration of caribou towards
Nuiqsut, like a permanent gravel road to the northernmost drill site. Calculating where air traffic
would occur and providing both the data and a “hot spot”-type graphic showing those estimates
would help locals evaluate the tradeoffs."
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"we ask BLM to
listen and defer to the community’s opinion of whether the expected flights for each alternative
would be more or less disruptive than a permanent gravel road and associated vehicle traffic. No
reasonable alternatives should be screened out before the Draft SEIS stage based on BLM’s
opinion of whether certain tradeoffs would be acceptable to the community or have worse
impacts on subsistence. Nuiqsut must be allowed to reach that conclusion for themselves."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"At this stage of development, there is virtually no risk that any oil will be permanently
stranded under any of these alternatives because the Willow development is just getting started
and this isn’t a one-shot deal. Conoco has already indicated it intends to expand from Willow to
access oil that won’t be reachable from the drill sites it’s currently proposing even under
Alternative B.[11] So even Conoco acknowledges that they expect to be back in a few years asking
BLM to approve more drill sites in this area. Therefore, BLM can rest assured that approving
just three or four drill sites during this process will not permanently strand any oil; it will just require Conoco to seek further authorization prior to proceeding with additional development
later.

More specifically, even if Conoco’s position that they will be able to access about 26M
fewer barrels of oil under Alternative BT2N is correct, that’s not determinative because those
barrels can be accessed from a different drill site later. Only if that oil would become
inaccessible would it qualify as permanently “stranded”. But nothing in the Willow area will be
stranded until there is no possibility of accessing it, which is a long way off. At a minimum,
technological advancements in drilling in the coming years will continue to reduce the amount of
oil that isn’t accessible from the drill sites that are permitted in this process. And any argument
claiming it would never make economic sense to build another drill site farther north than BT2N
is too hypothetical to support a conclusion that the oil would be permanently stranded. Kuukpik
suspects that if oil prices remained at current levels, for example, it wouldn’t take long at all for
Conoco to apply to build a small drill site north of BT2N after all.

The point is that BLM doesn’t need to authorize every drill site in the BTU now in order
to avoid stranding oil. Just because Conoco may not be able to reach all the oil in the Unit from
one of the drill sites BLM authorizes in this process doesn’t mean they will never reach it.
Conoco practically acknowledged as much when they asked BLM to approve just three drill sites
in the 2020 Willow ROD. The fact that Conoco requested that limitation -- and BLM approved
just the three sites -- implicitly demonstrates that the current process does not need to result in a
ROD that gives Conoco access to all the oil it will ever drill in the Willow area. We therefore
urge BLM to focus on reducing impacts even if it means Conoco needs to go through additional
applications or NEPA process to obtain approval for additional drill sites later on. The oil will
still be there."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," Conoco states that Alternative BT2N would include 219 wells compared to Alternative B’s
251. (EED, p. 2-6) Despite the reduced number of wells, Conoco indicates that Alternative
BT2N would require one more year of drilling (7) than all other alternatives (6). (EED, p. 2-
30) The vague explanation for this longer drilling time is that there would be more wells
drilled at BT1 and “one fewer pad on which to place rigs and equipment.” (EED, p. 2-30).
These statements require further explanation since it’s not self-evident that either factor
should slow Conoco’s progress down by an entire year."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"Alternative BT2N does not include the Constructed Freshwater Reservoir (CFWR) that is
proposed for all other alternatives. (EED, p. 2-19 – 2-20) Kuukpik would like to understand
more about why the CFWR isn’t needed for Alternative BT2N, what the relative advantages
and disadvantages are, and what changes in impacts result from the decision to construct or omit the CFWR. The properties and ability of Lake M0015 to be the source of significant
freshwater also need to be studied and understood."
"PETIAP","Integrated Activity Plan (IAP)",,," Conoco states multiple times in the EED that Willow will comply with the 2013 and 2020
NPR-A IAPs. (See, e.g., EED, p. 2-32, 2-62) This language has never made much sense to
Kuukpik because the 2013 and 2020 IAPs are different in many respects, and it is not always
clear (nor should it be up to Conoco to decide) which requirements are more protective in a
particular instance. But this appears to be a moot point now because its Kuukpik’s
understanding that the 2020 IAP is being withdrawn and will no longer have any legal or
practical effect. This makes thing very clear and simple for Conoco and BLM: the Willow
Project should comply with the 2013 NPR-A IAP Best Management Practices and other
requirements (including applicable Special Areas that would have been eliminated under the
2020 IAP). References to the 2020 IAPs only seem to cause confusion at this point and, we
believe, should be eliminated."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,,"The use of single and multi-season ice pads has become increasingly common. To Kuukpik’s
knowledge, there have not been any studies of the impacts from these pads or formal efforts to
observe the time it takes for the tundra to recover after the pads are allowed to melt. Our
experience is that the tundra under these pads is impacted for at least a couple of years, and
there are some instances of more significant tundra damage (believed to have been caused by
vehicles on the saturated tundra after the pads have melted). We encourage BLM to require
more methodical analysis and studies regarding the impacts and recovery times for tundra
affected by ice pads, and to develop any criteria that may be needed to ensure that these areas
are rehabilitated as thoroughly and promptly as possible. We also need to begin to understand
whether it is preferable to have a single area used multiple times for ice pads or whether it is
better to move these pads around and allow the used areas to recover. Finally, Conoco states
that 10 multi-season ice pads would be needed to support both Alternatives B or BT2N, but
only 7 are listed in the tables. (EED, pp. 2-46 and 2-52) Are the other 3 related to sealift
module delivery (EED, p. 2-69) or something else?"
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," Alternative BT2N includes 200 foot tall communications towers at each drill site. (EED, pp.
2-6 and 2-9) We believe existing communications towers are 140 feet tall. While we
understand Willow is farther from existing infrastructure, could these proposed towers be
reduced in height by, for example, using the standalone 200 foot tall tower at the WOC as a
repeater for smaller drill site towers?"
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," What “emergency” would justify discharging wastewater on the tundra? (EED, p. 2-20)"
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," Are the pipeline valves on either side of Fish Creek and Just Creeks automatic or manual?
(EED, p. 2-27) Manual valves would have a significantly longer shutoff response time than
automatic ones."
"ATT11","Request for More Detail",,," We continue to urge BLM and Conoco to explore the use of drones for pipeline inspections,
particularly where infrared technology is being used and visual inspection is not as critical or
can be done by camera in conjunction with infrared. (See, e.g., EED, p. 2-28)"
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"It also doesn't need to be done fast. Developing alternatives and analyzing them in enough detail to satisfy the courts and stakeholders will take time. That's ok. The oil isn't going anywhere, and neither is ConocoPhillips. BLM can take the time it needs to develop alternatives that might meaningfully reduce Willow's impacts on Nuiqsut and the North Slope and to perform the analysis that will inform stakeholders about the issues that matter most. The process shouldn't be rushed just to try to get a Record of Decision issued in time to let Conoco start dumping gravel in the winter of 2022/2023. It took about five months to produce the earlier Draft Supplemental EIS, and that document only analyzed a few comparatively simple aspects of the overall Willow Project. Here, the court has ordered BLM to look at one or more totally new alternatives. It's completely reasonable to expect that analysis to take longer than the earlier SEIS. In fact, it probably should take longer if the analysis is going to withstand the next court challenge. Rather than rush the process and risk another remand (which really might doom the Project even though this remand will not), we urge BLM to take the time it needs to do this right, not fast. "
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," We're concerned this process is already getting a little off track because there is no formal public scoping period---a decision we assume was made largely (or entirely) to avoid having to receive and respond to written comments from everyone who BLM didn't directly invite to participate in this informal process. Kuukpik certainly appreciates BLM's efforts to engage with us. But there haven't been any meetings in Nuiqsut for local community members to participate in, nor any opportunity for other interested parties to weigh in on the scope of the supplemental analysis. "
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"The Fairbanks Building and Construction Trades (FBCT) Council has reviewed the Conoco Phillips Alaska Willow Master Development Plan and the Council fully supports the project. "
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," this unusual informal scoping process put Kuukpik and other commenters at a substantive disadvantage (in addition to leaving the general public out of the process altogether). Rather than providing any written descriptions on the types of alternatives BLM might be considering in response to the court's decision, BLM essentially asked Kuukpik to propose an alternative for analysis. While in some ways we appreciate the spirit of the request, the reality is we are being forced to speak mostly in hypotheticals and broad generalities because we don't have any proposed new alternatives in front of us yet. That makes it very difficult to provide specific input. [7] It is much easier for laypeople to comment on a proposed alternative than to create one from scratch,"
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," we're being forced to take a position without knowing what anyone else is discussing or proposing---because there's no public process going on. There's just a bunch of one on one conversations between BLM, Conoco, Kuukpik, and probably a few others. That's not really how this is supposed to work. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"The two primary development alternatives KPK thinks should be analyzed are (1) roadless BT4 and BTS development options, and (2) a consolidated development option that would involve either 3 or 4 total drill sites, with the northernmost drill site farther south than previously envisioned and, potentially, the southernmost drill site farther north."
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"Another option is to authorize Willow in phases. For example, the core Willow facilities and 2-3 drill sites could be approved in the next 12-24 months and construction carried out over the next few years. Kuukpik would then want to see a meaningful delay (at least 3-5 years after Phase 1 construction was complete) before any additional drill sites are constructed to allow time for Willow's impacts to become better understood, both through scientific studies and traditional knowledge and local observation. "
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"BLM will need to listen to the community's opinion of whether the expected flights for each alternative would be more or less disruptive than installing a permanent gravel road and the vehicle trips that would be required under other alternatives. Willow is far enough west of Nuiqsut that a certain level of air traffic to and from the Project might not be as disruptive as a permanent gravel road and the very high number of vehicle traffic that would be generated by an entirely road-connected project. This is particularly true for Kuukpik because our privately-owned AN CSA lands would be spared some of the vehicle traffic under certain roadless alternatives. "
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,," High inflation numbers, the US dependance on foreign oil, unstable global oil markets can only lead to one logical conclusion. Coupling this with the financial benefits to workers, and Federal, State and Local Governments means moving this project forward, as soon as possible, is a “no brainer”. "
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"No one is better equipped to evaluate whether air or vehicle traffic would be more disruptive to caribou and to Nuiqsut's hunters than those hunters themselves"
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"In addition, there are at least two issues that need to be analyzed that BLM has not yet considered in any detail: (i) the option of building a diesel pipeline to reduce fuel truck deliveries, and (ii) the impacts that different mud plant locations would have on Kuukpik's lands and subsistence resources. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," If a meaningful portion of those trips can be eliminated by constructing a diesel pipeline, then the pipeline should be built. Not only will this reduce vehicle traffic during the construction and operations phases of Willow, a pipeline between CDI and Willow would actually reduce the current amount of vehicle traffic because the pipeline could also serve every road-accessible drill site between Alpine and Willow (CDS, GMTl, and GMT2) that currently requires fuel to be delivered by truck."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"We urge the Federal Government to give the Willow project top priority and to expedite the process to allow construction to resume for the 2022-2023 winter season. This project has been studied to death and any further delays in completing the SEIS and the record of decision will continue to harm the interested parties"
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," There are at least three pipeline options that should be analyzed: 
1. A diesel pipeline from CDI to Willow, constructed on CPAI's preferred/proposed timeline. This option is less desirable because the pipeline would not be in place in time to deliver diesel during the first few years of construction, meaning there would be several years of truck-delivered diesel early in the project. But this option would reduce truck traffic for the other 30-plus years of the Project, so clearly this option is preferable to no pipeline at all and is worth analyzing in detail. The perfect should not get in the way of the good here. 
2. A diesel pipeline from CDI to Willow, constructed in the first construction season. This option would simply require CPAI to phase construction in a way that would maximize the benefits of installing a diesel pipeline and reduce impacts more than their proposed schedule would. The potential benefits are significant, but won't be precisely known until this option is analyzed in the EIS. The costs may not be great either since CPAI will be building pipelines eventually anyway; this option would just require them to be built sooner. 
3. A diesel pipeline from CD l to GMT2, built in the first construction season. If for any reason it is infeasible to install a diesel pipeline to Willow, a backup plan would be to install a pipeline as far as GMT2. Delivering fuel to GMT2 by pipeline would allow gravel haulers and other vehicles to refuel at GMT2 rather than driving all the way back across Kuukpik Lands and past Nuiqsut to Alpine. Those trucks would only have to travel between Willow and GMT2, which would eliminate much of the traffic Kuukpik is concerned about. Kuukpik believes there are plans to install pipelines to GMT2 for non-diesel purposes already. So this option could re-purpose one of those pipelines during Willow construction, or simply be an additional pipeline that gets installed for permanent diesel use. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Another significant issue is where CPAI will process all the drilling muds needed for Willow. Kuukpik believes the prior NEPA analyses anticipated that Willow would have its own mudplant for that purpose. [13] But our understanding is that may no longer be the case, and that CPAI may wish to process drilling muds at the existing mudplant at the Kuukpik Pad. Processing mud at the K-Pad would require thousands more vehicle trips across Kuukpik-owned lands than an onsite Willow mud plant facility. It would also require additional water use from the lakes near the K-Pad, which may not even be able to meet such an increased demand on a year-round basis. None of these impacts were analyzed in the earlier EISs. It is therefore imperative that BLM analyze and compare the impacts from processing drilling muds at Willow versus an expanded facility at the existing K-Pad. In addition to facilitating a decision on which mudplant location would have less impacts, analyzing this detail is critical to accurately projecting the overall number of vehicle trips that would be associated with any version of the Willow Project. "
"ATT09","Request for New Analysis",,," we recommend BLM review the North Slope Borough's rezone ordinance for the Willow Project (passed in January 2021). That ordinance imposed a number of requirements for Willow that had not previously been required (e.g., use of insulation in roads and pads to reduce the height and visual impacts from these features; a stipulation requiring CPAI to transport Nuiqsut hunters and their gear to and from other areas where they are welcome to hunt if caribou are not available in traditional areas, etc.). See Attachment 2. We urge BLM to consider these measures in the context of the Willow Project as well, and analyze whether any or all of them should be included in the supplemental NEPA analysis to help reduce impacts to subsistence. "
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"We resubmit the attached City of Atqasuk Resolution 2021-05 regarding The Willow project.

"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," the Rezone ordinance hearings were the last time most of the Nuiqsut community was involved in any public process surrounding Willow. Everything that has happened since then has largely been in court rooms and in private meetings between BLM, Conoco, and a few other stakeholders. In fact, BLM has not hosted an in person meeting in Nuiqsut to discuss Willow since 2019. "
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,," but we do urge BLM to use this remand to improve the process by hosting several meetings in Nuiqsut in 2022 to ensure that everyone who wants to be heard in this process can be."
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Roadless Development for BT 4 (and Perhaps BT S) - Kuukpik provided excerpts from its correspondence to the BLM during the Willow scoping and Draft EIS processes to the BLM regarding road less development on November 24, 2021. As Kuukpik noted previously, the elimination of roads to these drill sites would eliminate about 12 miles of gravel roads (i.e. about 7 miles for BT 4 and about 5 miles for BT 5) or nearly half the total infield road length. Kuukpik does not believe each roadless satellite would necessarily require an airstrip. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"Relocate BT 4 Drill Site to a Southern Location -Based on the BLM's Willow Blackout Analysis, the BT 4 drill site could be located about 2 miles or more to the south from its present location. This alternative would provide some reduction of infrastructure in the TLSA. It is unknown to Kuukpik what the impact on recoverable reserves from Willow would be from this alternative. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"Relocate BT 5 Drill Site to a Northern Location - The BT 5 drill site could be located to a location 1-2 miles north of its present location. While the current BT 5 location is outside the TLSA, such a shift in location would reduce the north-south ""picket fence"" effect from the Willow project. Caribou move from the west (near Teshekpuk Lake) to the east where they are harvested by Nuiqsut subsistence hunters. Again, it is unknown to Kuukpik what the impact on recoverable reserves from Willow would be from this alternative. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Develop Willow in Phases - This alternative would allow BT I, BT 2, BT 3, the Willow airstrip, the Willow production facility, and the Willow operations center to be constructed as Phase I. Studies could then be performed for a specified time frame (e.g., 3-5 years after Willow Phase I is complete) to determine the impacts to subsistence and subsistence resources before moving on to the next phase. If the impacts are too great, as demonstrated from the study activities, other options for BT 4 and BT 5 development would be evaluated prior to any additional construction. This alternative is in some ways similar to the plan that was already approved in the 2020 Record Decision that did not approve BT4 and BT5. However, Kuukpik would want more time between the completion of Phase 1 and even beginning to permit a second phase. CPAl's previous plan did not include a long enough break to study Phase 1 's impacts. Such a delay between phases would be necessary to allow studies to be conducted and local observations to be made, and to use those results for the permitting process of Phase 2."
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Eliminate BT4 Drill Site - This alternative would likely provide the greatest reduction of infrastructure in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA). It is unknown to Kuukpik what the impact on recoverable reserves from Willow would be under this alternative. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Relocate the BT 2 Pad to a Western Location - While this relocation would not move the BT 2 drill site out of the TLSA, it would move the pad further away from Fish Creek. Such a move is expected to enhance waterfowl (and perhaps caribou) use of the Fish Creek area due to the noise reduction that would occur."
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"Seasonal Operation Restrictions - Kuukpik believes these measures should be incorporated into any final development scenario. The BLM could impose restrictions on activities such as vehicle traffic, aircraft traffic, drilling, fracturing, well workovers, and other activities that produce a significant amount of noise or require significant activities that may disturb waterfowl and caribou during a specified time frame. This action would be similar to the requirements already imposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on major projects to protect nesting waterfowl (i.e., no construction activities from June I to July 31). The time frame would need to be adjusted to cover caribou calving activities. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"Higher VSMs/HSMs - Vertical and horizontal support members are currently expected to be a minimum of 7 feet above the tundra. Increasing this minimum height to 8 feet (or higher) for all Willow infield pipelines would likely enhance caribou movement. "
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,," Early Installation of a Planned Willow Pipeline to Willow or GMT2 - Installing a pipeline to GMT2 and/or Willow early in the construction process would allow diesel for Willow construction to be moved by pipeline instead of trucks. Kuukpik understands that much of the diesel use for the Willow Project will occur during construction. Any reduction in truck traffic associated with the Willow project will minimize potential subsistence impacts. Since certain pipelines are already planned as part of the Project, one of them can simply be built early in the process and used for diesel, at least as far as GMT2 and possibly all the way to Willow. This would not even affect the Project's costs significantly since some pipelines are already proposed- it's just a matter timing. A line used for diesel during construction could even be repurposed for some other fluid later if a different permanent diesel line is built later or not ultimately needed. 
It's critical that this mitigation measure be examined now. CPAI is currently in the front end engineering and design process for Willow. If BLM examines this requirement now and determines that it would significantly reduce impacts, CPAI could incorporate this element in the project relatively easily and without undue extra expense. CPAI is already required to perform a pipeline utilization study to the NSB as part of the rezone process. However, that study would be worthless if it comes after this NEPA process is already completed and a new ROD issued because the Borough will not require CPAI to deviate too much from the project described in the ROD. Therefore, an early and independent analysis is necessary to determine how to incorporate any of these options into the Project. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,," Require Use of Insulation in Roads and Pads Wherever Feasible - This action will reduce the height and visual impacts of these features for caribou (and people) while still maintaining permafrost integrity. CPAl agreed as part of the NSB rezone process to use foam wherever possible. Hence, it would be a measure that BLM may adopt without CPAI objection. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,," Inclusion of a ""Good Neighbor"" Agreement for the Willow Project - In light of the troubling ANILCA 810 findings regarding the likely negative impacts to caribou and subsistence hunters, Kuukpik argued in favor of a ""Good Neighbor Agreement"" as part of the NSB rezone process and obtained a requirement that CP Al negotiate such an agreement with the community. In summary, if Nuiqsut experiences significant declines in caribou subsistence harvests, CPAI can be required to fly Nuiqsut hunters and their gear to a location where caribou are available. After the hunting activities are completed, CPAI will fly the hunters, their gear, and the harvested caribou back to Nuiqsut. Obviously Kuukpik hopes none of that is ever necessary, but since NSB has imposed this requirement, BLM might consider doing the same. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,," Require Use of Best Available Technology to Operate Roadless Drill Sites - CPAI has approximately 15 years of operational experience with the CD 3 drill site, which is not road connected to the remainder of the Alpine facilities. Technology has improved significantly since CD 3 startup. Equinor (previously known as Statoil) has operated the fully automated Oseberg H platform in the North Sea since 2018. It is very likely that a roadless Willow satellite could be fully automated as well, which would reduce vehicle and other impacts significantly. BLM should require use of best available technology in any roadless drill site scenario. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,," Require use of electric, natural gas, or gasoline powered vehicles - BLM required CPAI to study use of natural gas-powered vehicles as far back as 2015 at least. [1] If natural gas vehicles didn't work, CPAI was supposed to switch to electric or gasoline powered vehicles. Well over 6 years later, we haven't seen any electric vehicles in regular use, and most vehicles are still using diesel. Kuukpik requests BLM enforce its earlier stipulations on this issue and establish updated requirements and a timeline for adopting lower emission vehicles and equipment. "
"ATT09","Request for New Analysis",,," Use of Alternative Transportation to Roadless Drill Sites - Kuukpik encourages BLM to always consider evolving technology and look ""outside the box"" at ways to reduce impacts. For example, crafts like airships and hovercraft might be used to transport people or material to roadless drill sites. Airships have similar carrying capacities to C 130s, do not require long runways, and are quieter than conventional rotary or fixed wing aircraft. Hovercraft have been used on the North Slope (at Northstar) for personnel transport since around 200 I. Although that use occurs offshore currently, certain hovercrafts can be used on the tundra and are quieter that fixed or rotary wing aircraft. There are no significant river or stream crossings between BT 3 and BT 5, which could facilitate use of hovercraft in that area. Additional investigation would be needed to determine if a bridge or other structure across Fish Creek would be necessary for hovercraft to access BT 4 from BT 2. These options could eliminate the need for roads and/or airstrips at roadless drill sites. 
It is even worth considering whether things like an elevated light duty rail or monorail systems could one day be used on the North Slope. These types of systems could be integrated with VSM and pipelines to a certain degree, which would result in the ability to transport people or material without building a road or causing much significant impact to the tundra itself. An electrified monorail system would be extremely quiet and non-disruptive and could be achievable in the not-too-distant future. There is currently a monorail in operation as far north as Moscow, Russia. They have been proposed in Norway and Ukraine but not yet constructed. While these technologies may not be available in time for the Willow Project to take advantage of them, Kuukpik believes it's important that BLM continue to look ahead and be open to alternatives that at first glance may seem farfetched, but which could become the norm sooner than later. This will help reduce impacts as more and more development continues to come to the North Slope."
"S","Subsistence",,,"Nuiqsut is the community most affected by oil development on the North Slope to date, and those impacts will only increase if Willow is constructed. Not only is the entire Willow Project area within the traditional subsistence range of Nuiqsut, so is the entire Bear Tooth Unit in which Willow lies. Kuukpik, as the ANCSA Village corporation for Nuiqsut, owns tens of thousands of acres of land between Nuiqsut and the proposed Willow Project. BLM's prior NEPA analyses have shown that Willow will impact these privately held lands more than any others, particularly due to all the vehicle traffic over Kuukpik-owned lands and the likely disruption of caribou migration to and from Kuukpik's lands where Nuiqsut residents and Kuukpik shareholders subsist."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I write as a voter concerned about the degraded earth where our grandchildren - and theirs - will have to live if we don't get on top of climate change.

As noted above, EO 13186 encourages conservation of species of concern and consideration of 
management objectives and recommendations resulting from comprehensive planning efforts. 
In this regard two key documents are the Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan, Version III, 
which was published in 2019, and the 2021 update to the FWS Birds of Conservation Concern. 
The 2016 version of Shorebirds of Conservation Concern in the United States is also key, though 
more recent information may be available (contact Brad Andres, Coordinator, U.S. Shorebird
Conservation Plan, FWS, to find the latest)."
"RTB","Birds",,,"East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership: The U.S. is a member of the East AsianAustralasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP), and the Supplemental EIS should consider any 
obligations and priorities that result from that international agreement. This is an important 
time for the EAAFP, as the Asian Development Bank and BirdLife International have 
announced the commitment of up to $3B for wetland conservation in the flyway, and it is 
essential that actions taken by the United States in NPR-A do not compromise those 
international efforts, especially with respect to Arctic-breeding Dunlins (Calidris alpina arcticola). "
"RTB","Birds",,,"Dunlins: As per the Alaska Shorebird Conservation Plan, available evidence points toward 
declining numbers of the Arctic-breeding Dunlin subspecies. Although loss of intertidal and 
coastal habitats in the Yellow Sea and perhaps elsewhere on the coast of Asia are strongly 
implicated, other causes of decline may be in play and are not fully known. The Supplemental 
EIS should thoroughly explore the distribution and ecology of arcticola Dunlin in relation to 
possible development in the Willow project area. Loss of nesting habitat, disturbance, predation 
and other impacts could affect the productivity and survival of this subspecies, and those 
impacts would be added to other impacts away from NPR-A. These cumulative effects could 
increase the rate of decline in an already declining subspecies. Since a large fraction of the entire 
arcticola Dunlin population nests in NPR-A, BLM has a special responsibility to look out for the 
conservation of this subspecies. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"  The Willow project is a climate disaster. This proposed huge network of oil and gas infrastructure advanced by Conoco-Phillips in Alaska's western Arctic should NOT move forward.

Adding 250 million metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere is irresponsible. Arctic Alaska is already warming faster than the rest of North America. 

Habitat fragmentation in the region of the Teshekpuk Lake Caribou herd is a threat to the food security of Alaskan natives. This would also affect populations of other wildlife adversely. 

The western Arctic's ecosystems are already affected by climate change, and need more protection from extraction industries, not less.

"RTB","Birds",,,"Yellow-billed Loon: As with the Arctic-breeding Dunlin, a large fraction of the entire Yellow—
billed Loon population nests within NPR-A, and BLM bears special responsibility to look out 
for the welfare of this species. In 2006, prompted by a possible decision to list the Yellow-billed 
Loon under the Endangered Species Act, several federal and state agencies signed a Yellowbilled Loon (Gavia adamsii) Conservation Agreement. It is not clear what actions were taken 
pursuant to the YBLO Conservation Agreement. However, following a FWS decision not to list 
the Yellow-billed Loon under the ESA, the agreement was allowed to lapse in 2016 and has not 
3
been renewed. Unfortunately, the failure to renew the agreement signaled that the only 
motivation for the Conservation Agreement itself was to preclude a listing decision rather than 
active concern for the loon itself. I encourage a close look at the lapsed Conservation 
Agreement, how its provisions may pertain to the Willow project, and whether the agreement 
should be renewed in some form. 
Fortunately, there is a long history of surveys and monitoring of Yellow-billed Loons in the 
Willow project area through ConocoPhillips’ Avian Studies in the Willow Project Area. For 
purposes of the Supplemental EIS, the annual reports of these studies need to be closely 
evaluated and mined for insights on impacts and best practices related to oil development. For 
example, I note in the 2019 report (p. 30-31) that “since 2010 in the NPR-A, predation of 1 or
both eggs has been documented by time-lapse cameras at 33 of 59 nests… The majority (52%) of 
identified predators were Glaucous Gulls and Parasitic Jaegers…” If the Willow project 
ultimately proceeds, can we expect an increase in predation by Glaucous Gulls and how might 
such an increase affect the Yellow-billed Loon population?
Like the arcticola Dunlin, Yellow-billed Loons face significant challenges along marine coasts 
during the non-breeding season. Any increase in mortality, loss of productivity, or reduced 
survival due to oil and gas activity in NPR-A and specifically the Willow project area would be 
added to other losses, such as harvest mortality, drowning in fishing nets, and oil spills, which 
may occur along the Chukchi and Bering Sea coasts in Alaska as well as along the Russian coast 
and south down the Asian coast. "

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," I am  making you aware that in addition to the significant damage that this Arctic oil and gas drilling  project would generate to our worsening climate change disaster crisis, the ConocoPhillips’ plan also calls for the creation of 37 miles of new gravel roads, seven bridges, an airstrip, and a gravel mine, which would jeopardize the health and traditional practices of nearby Alaska Native communities and devastate protection for local Arctic wildlife which includes polar bears, migratory birds, and caribou.  I am making you aware that during an acceleration of our biodiversity crisis, our country must ensure full protection for endangered wildlife in the Arctic and any consideration of approval or operation of the ConocoPhillips Arctic drilling project is exactly the opposite of what direction our country must mandate. 
     It is crucial to acknowledge that our worsening climate change disaster crisis is largely driven by the environmental damage and pollution from operations of the fossil fuel industry. This crisis is causing the Arctic to warm faster than any other region on earth, leading to melting permafrost, eroding coastlines, and destruction of the habitat that ensures survival for endangered Arctic wildlife and the livelihood of Alaska Native communities, All of these impacts will be  devastating for this fragile region.

"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"BLM should prepare a revised draft EIS and completely reassess the Willow project. The outcomes that BLM is seeking to achieve and the directives that it must implement have changed dramatically since the agency’s 2020 FEIS and Record of Decision. Agencies have considerable discretion whether to prepare a supplemental or revised draft EIS but where, as here, BLM must revise its purpose and need statement and consider a much broader range of alternatives than previously analyzed, re-starting the process with a scoping period and revised draft EIS is the more logical choice. Ultimately, an adequate analysis will need to accomplish a great deal more “supplementation” than typically occurs in SEISs, which are frequently prepared to assess some discrete issue not fully analyzed previously. Starting the assessment anew would signal much more clearly to all involved that the decisional framework has significantly changed and the project must be evaluated in a new light."
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"BLM should revise the statement of purpose and need to reflect the completely different climate change policy direction from the current administration compared to the previous one. It should develop a broader range of alternatives based on that revised statement that can support decisions that implement the current administration’s climate policy objectives while complying with all other applicable laws. As the district court noted, nothing compels BLM to approve the Willow project according to Conoco’s desires, or indeed to approve it at all. The purpose and need statement and suite of alternatives analyzed should reflect that fact. BLM had no climate direction to follow at the time of its 2020 decision; now it does. That fundamentally changes the analysis it needs to undertake."
"PETIAP","Integrated Activity Plan (IAP)",,,"For the same reasons that BLM needs to completely revise the purpose and need statement and alternatives, it should consider revising its Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) for the Reserve before or in parallel with evaluating the Willow proposal. Revising the IAP to reflect the administration’s climate and biodiversity policy goals is a critical step needed to signal more broadly to all stakeholders how BLM will manage the Reserve consistent with all relevant management goals. BLM has indicated an intent to withdraw the 2020 IAP Record of Decision and select the No Action alternative instead, effectively reinstating the 2013 IAP with perhaps some modifications. While that is a welcome step, that 2013 IAP is inconsistent with addressing the climate crisis and effectuating the administration’s climate commitments and biodiversity goals. Ideally, a decision on Willow would be made with new, contemporaneous Reserve-wide management direction in mind.
"
"RTGE","General Economics",,,"BLM should also revise its economic analysis to account for the many other oil and gas activities occurring and planned on the north slope. The vast majority of north slope oil activity takes place on state land, provides considerable jobs and revenue, and will continue to do so with or without the Willow project.
"
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"Executive Order 14008 states that “It is the policy of my Administration to organize and deploy the full capacity of its agencies to combat the climate crisis to implement a Government-wide approach that reduces climate pollution in every sector of the economy.”[1] The policy seeks to “put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.”[2] The Order also states that the U.S. is rejoining the Paris Agreement, joining most of the rest of the world in committing to GHG emission-reducing efforts designed to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. On Earth Day last year, President Biden also announced a national goal of reducing U.S. GHG emissions 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030, and of meeting the 1.5°C Paris target.[3]

These significant commitments represent a dramatic change in our nation’s climate change policy compared to the previous administration. In what might be termed a Government-wide “head-in-the-sand” approach, the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement and all but scrubbed the words “climate change” from its vocabulary. When it issued the Willow ROD, BLM was working in a completely different policy environment than it is now. It must reconsider the purpose and need of the Willow project in light of that new environment.
"
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"The FEIS also frames declining production (and associated emissions) as a problem that the Willow project would address, when in fact the Willow project will exacerbate our problem of sending dangerous levels of CO2 into the atmosphere. For example, BLM’s Abstract blithely states that the Willow project “would help offset declines in production from the North Slope oil fields and contribute to the local, state, and national economies”5 – as if there are no competing considerations that might mitigate against significantly increasing GHG emissions from federal lands for 30 years or more and incentivizing even more pollution beyond that. But reducing climate pollution from every sector of the economy, including oil fields, is the goal of Executive Order 14008 and is needed to address the climate crisis. Viewed with our climate commitments in mind, declining emissions from the oil and gas sector is the goal to be accomplished, not a problem that needs fixing."
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"BLM should also assess the “need” for the Willow project, and for new oil from federal lands in general, in terms of projected oil supply and demand. Almost half of U.S. petroleum consumption currently consists of gasoline for cars and trucks[6] so replacing much of the fleet with electric vehicles (EVs) will alone cut U.S. oil demand substantially.[7] Our national goal is for EVs to achieve 50% of sales share by 2030.[8]"
"ENPTPN","Purpose and Need",,,"BLM is responsible for effectuating this administration’s climate change policy goals, consistent with its other responsibilities, and it must redefine the project purpose and need to include those goals. Implementing Executive Order 14008 and other Presidential directives must be among BLM’s purposes when assessing Conoco’s proposal."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," I oppose any more drilling in the western article. We need to transition to renewable energy sources now."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"In considering Conoco’s proposal, BLM can and should seek to minimize the adverse impacts, including GHG emissions, associated with its decision. It should ensure that the Willow project decision, considered together with the federal government’s cumulative existing and projected permitted GHG emissions and projected national emissions as a whole, is consistent with the steep overall emission declines required by our national climate goals and international obligations. Its alternatives analyses must explore whether and under what conditions BLM can authorize some version of Conoco’s proposal consistent with those goals and obligations."
"ENPTA","Alternatives",,,"For example, BLM claimed that it could not delay project analysis or permitting because that would violate a statute, 42 U.S.C. 6506(a), directing BLM to expeditiously carry out an oil and gas leasing program in the Reserve.[10] It also claimed that any delay would violate Conoco’s development rights under its leases and interfere with Conoco’s obligations to promptly pursue development.[11]

These assertions are without merit and BLM should revise the EIS accordingly. A “delay” – i.e., a deviation from Conoco’s desired timeline – in assessing the proposed project, or an eventual decision to reduce its scope, production, carbon footprint, or other impacts is wholly within BLM’s discretion."
"ATT10","Request for New Alternative",,,"BLM also rejected the alternative of upgrading the existing Alpine CPF instead of constructing a new one for reasons that don’t withstand scrutiny. While the existing CPF is projected to lack sufficient capacity to process oil, gas and water from Conoco’s desired project in addition to other projects, it is an option to increase that capacity instead of constructing a new CPF.[12] It is also an option to limit throughput from Willow to levels less than what Conoco would choose, were it the decision-maker. BLM noted some impacts related to the existing CPF option but never found them unreasonable nor compared them to the impacts of constructing the new CPF.[13]

BLM should analyze that alternative and compare the impacts of the two, including a quantification of likely induced exploitation. A new CPF connected to the TAPS by new gravel roads, ice roads and pipelines will improve the economics of future oil development projects in the Reserve that are currently farther removed from existing infrastructure. For that reason, BLM should not permit a new CPF if it can be avoided – which it can.
"
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"As a citizen who is deeply concerned about climate change and an enthusiast of recreation on public lands, I would like to voice my opposition to the Willow Project. This project would drill in sensitive Alaskan ecosystems, threaten a Native Alaskan community, and ultimately pave the way for more drilling and more fossil fuel extraction. 

The last thing we need in a climate emergency is a project that produces the equivalent annual emissions of 66 new coal fired power plants. This project is simply incompatible with a safer climate future because we do not have room to further develop fossil fuel infrastructure if we are to meet our emissions reduction goals. 

Please, reject this proposed oil project in the fragile Western Arctic. 
"
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The FEIS presented an overly simplistic analysis of the jobs and oil-related revenue that the proposed oil exploitation would generate – with the only meaningful alternative to Conoco’s proposal in economic terms being the No Action alternative.[14] The revised analysis should address the economic effects associated with a range of GHG emission profiles that track our national climate goals and commitments."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," I oppose the Willow project because we cannot afford to continue business as usual due to the climate crisis. Rather than adding the huge amounts of greenhouse gasses that are estimated for the life of this project by ConocoPhillips, we need to be denying such projects.Time is running out! You must also truly consider the harm that will be caused to wildlife and people dependent on subsistence hunting."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"You should stop ConocoPhillips’ disastrous Western Arctic drilling plan. It has long been clear that climate change, mainly driven by the fossil fuel industry, is causing the Arctic to warm faster than any other region on earth. Melting permafrost, eroding coastlines, and other impacts  are devastating this fragile region. Given this obvious reality, it’s unconscionable to allow ConocoPhillips to drill for more oil. 

ConocoPhillips’ plan calls for 37 miles of new gravel roads, seven bridges, an airstrip, and a gravel mine, which would devastate local wildlife like polar bears, migratory birds, and caribou are a;; unacceptable results in their own rights.. And what about their contribution to our accelerating biodiversity crisis? Endangered wildlife needs protection.  This plan does the opposite. 

Your agency is responsible for providing stewardship over public lands for the good of every living thing and to consider long-term climate impacts when deciding whether to permit industrial activity.  These obligations have far-reaching impacts for future generations. You should not move forward with this drilling project that will harm us all for the sake of the bottom line of a single company."
"RTGE","General Economics",,,"The FEIS also characterized the impact of choosing the No Action alternative as meaning flat or decreased employment and tax revenues:

Under Alternative A, the Project would not be developed and there would be no increase in employment or wages in Nuiqsut, the NSB, or the state. Employment opportunities in Nuiqsut and the NSB would remain at current levels and oil sector employment in the state would likely decrease. New property tax revenues would not be generated for the NSB and no new oil and gas tax revenues would be added to the Alaska general fund or the NPR-A Impact Grant Program.[15]

BLM provided no analysis to support these conclusions, which ignore the substantial amount of other oil and gas activity on the north slope recognized elsewhere in the document but not quantified in terms of future employment or revenue. According to the FEIS, for example, other oil activity has already abated the prior decline in north slope oil production and more projects are underway.[16] Recent Alaska Department of Revenue data and reporting confirm that north slope oil production is increasing and is projected to continue to increase with or without the Willow project as oil from other projects reaches the market.[17]"
"ENPTCE","Cumulative Effects",,,"Present development is depicted in Figure 3.1.1 but only includes the area from Teshekpuk Lake to Kuparuk.[18] Reasonably foreseeable future activities (RFFA) noted in the FEIS include the Nunashuk, Placer, Mustang, Nuna DS2 and other projects.[19] BLM appears to ignore Emerald House’s Peregrine project, currently in a five-year exploration drilling phase. The new NEPA analysis should consider that project, which is projected to contain much more oil than Willow would produce."
"RTGE","General Economics",,,"For economic analysis purposes, BLM should assess current and projected north slope oil and gas production, revenue, and associated GHG emissions as a whole, with and without its alternate versions of the Willow proposal. Those metrics will not necessarily decrease going forward if the Willow project is not permitted, or is permitted to generate lesser GHG emissions than proposed. Instead, selecting the No Action alternative will likely still result in increased north slope oil production, revenue and GHG emissions in the future due to the many other projects underway. In particular, property taxes on oil infrastructure generate the lion’s share of regional revenues and will continue to do so with or without Willow.[20]

In contrast to the Willow proposal, many of these other projects are outside the Reserve on state land and thus generate more revenue for the state. They are also outside of BLM’s regulatory authority and are permitted by the state, which lacks any meaningful goals or commitments to reduce GHG emissions. So if significant north slope oil industry GHG emission reductions are to happen at all, BLM will need to be a leader in making them happen. A proper analysis will show that the local, regional and national economic effects of doing so are entirely manageable."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The Arctic is warming faster than any other region on earth, leading to melting permafrost, eroding coastlines, and a host of other impacts. Drilling for oil in this fragile ecosystem is a clear opening for disaster.  "
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The Biden Administration has made it a top priority to “tackle the climate crisis,” as set forth in Executive Order 14008 and as expressed in its decision to rejoin the rest of the world in collective efforts to stabilize our climate pursuant to the Paris Agreement. Permitting the massive Willow project is inconsistent with these actions and goals."

IWG’s SC‐GHG estimates.[6] Regardless of its specific effect and its fate on appeal, this decision
does not and cannot alter BLM’s obligations under NEPA to take a hard look at the climate
impacts of a project, including by quantifying those impacts.[7]

BLM remains obligated to analyze the project’s GHG emissions in the context of the climate
crisis and consider the emissions’ significance, explaining the project’s “incremental impact” on
climate change.[8] The agency “must communicate the ‘actual environmental effects resulting
from . . . emissions’ of greenhouse gas, not just quantify them.”[9] To do this, BLM must
accurately describe the context in which this decision is being made and in which emissions
would occur, reflecting the urgent nature of the climate emergency, the national and
international commitments to respond, and the catastrophic consequences of failing to meet
those commitments. And it must use multiple tools to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze
the significance of the emissions in that context."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The increasing dangers of the climate emergency
are further underscored by a report issued just last week by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), which documents widespread, pervasive impacts to ecosystems and
people from human‐caused climate change including, among many other things, damage and
loss of life from climate and weather extremes, species loss, increased food and water
insecurity, ocean warming and acidification, and harm to physical and mental health.[11] The
report highlights the limits on the ability of ecosystems and society to adapt, and the narrowing
window to avert many irreversible impacts and to enable climate resilience.[12] In the face of this
crisis, all countries must take immediate action to avoid catastrophic warming.[13] Developing
new fossil fuel projects is incompatible with necessary efforts to quickly phase out fossil fuels in
order to adequately address the climate emergency.[14]
"
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Climate analysis of the Willow project’s emissions must also account for the United States’ and
international commitment to reduce emissions 50 to 52 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by
2050, and the imperative to meet those targets.[15] In other words, the baseline against which
the project is compared should be a scenario in which global GHG emissions drop by half by the
end of the decade, and to near zero by 2050. This will aid in a proper evaluation of the
incremental increase in significance of emissions from the project over time."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"To properly quantify the climate impacts of GHG emissions, BLM must do more than merely
estimate the tonnage of the project’s GHG emissions16 or simply compare project emissions to global or national totals.[17] BLM should also evaluate Willow’s emissions together with the
emissions from other foreseeable projects in the context of the global and U.S. carbon budgets,
based on climate change thresholds. IPCC reports and other expert assessments have
established global carbon budgets, or the total amount of carbon that can be burned while
maintaining some probability of staying below a given temperature target. The IPCC’s 2021
Report estimates that the remaining global carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 is only
400 and 300 gigatons of tCO2 for maintaining 67 percent and 83 percent likelihoods,
respectively, of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.[18] Published scientific studies have estimated
the United States’ portion of the global carbon budget by allocating the remaining global
budget across countries based on factors including equity principles and economics.[19] The
wealth of high‐quality information on climate change[20] offer BLM ample resources to assist in
making an assessment of the significance of the Willow project’s GHG emissions."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The 2020 BLM Specialist Report on Annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Trends[21]
helps lay the groundwork for a quantitative emissions analysis that aids in determining
significance. By “comparing emissions levels between proposed actions, current emissions and
conditions, and published predictions based on forecasted emission scenarios” BLM can “form
a qualitative judgment about the potential for climate impacts from a proposed action.”[22] The
Specialist Report references Executive Order 13990, which deems capturing an accurate full
social cost of GHG emissions essential and doing so “facilitates sound decision‐making.”[23] SCGHG
provides a widely accepted, useful tool that allows agencies to quantify, monetize, and
contextualize GHG impacts consistent with climate science. Moreover, the agency is mandated
to monetize the costs of GHG emissions if it considers monetized economic benefits of a
project.[24] Acknowledging that the IWG’s interim SC‐GHG values are likely an underestimate of the true social costs,[25] BLM should use the IWG’s final update to the SC‐GHG estimates once
those estimates are available.[26]"
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"It is now well settled that
agencies must estimate the upstream and downstream GHG emissions that will result from a
proposed action, and may not assume perfect substitution.[28] Moreover, as the Alaska district
court confirmed with respect to BLM’s prior Willow environmental impact statement (EIS), any
attempt to model energy displacement and thereby predict a project’s net emissions must be
accurate and cannot exclude key considerations.[29] Therefore, if BLM continues to use a
displacement model to predict the Willow project’s net emissions, it must correct the serious
deficiencies that led to inaccurate and misleading estimates in the previous EIS.[30] But, just as
importantly, BLM should not consider this uncertain and inherently speculative estimate as a
substitute for, or even on equal footing with, a much more certain estimate of a project’s total
upstream and downstream emissions.

There are several inherent problems with current net displacement analysis that renders such
analysis insufficient to meet NEPA’s goals of full disclosure and consideration. First, the analysis
relies on an untenable business‐as‐usual assumption that under a no‐action alternative, fossil
fuel production will otherwise continue unabated. This ignores the international
commitments—and indeed existential necessity—to rapidly phase out production and
consumption of fossil fuels to near zero in the next several decades. This type of analysis also
ignores the basic physics of producing a finite resource: if BLM chooses not to permit
development of a unit of oil, that reduces the total carbon available to be burned and added to
the atmosphere. Second, it attempts to deflect the agency’s responsibility for concrete harms
caused by its actions on the basis that someone else will probably cause the same harms
anyway. BLM has agency over, and responsibility for, the impacts that will be caused by its
decisions, and NEPA requires it to assess and be accountable for those impacts. Finally, this
analysis compares a relatively simple, certain estimate of the emissions from constructing and
operating a project and transporting and burning the fossil fuels it would produce with a highly
uncertain and very complicated analysis of what might happen if the Willow project is not built.
BLM must not treat these very different estimates as equivalent in value."
"LEG","Legal Compliance",,,"As the Alaska district court explained, BLM’s previous EIS and record of decision wrongly assumed that the agency lacked authority to limit ConocoPhillips’ activities.[31] In fact, BLM has clear, statutory obligations to condition or restrict oil and gas activity as it determines necessary to protect other resources and to mitigate adverse environmental effects, along with the authority to deny a project altogether if its impacts are too severe.[32] "
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"If its analysis demonstrates that approving Willow will have unacceptable
climate consequences and is contrary to the action necessary to address the climate
emergency, BLM can and should reach a decision that is in accordance with the science and the federal government’s commitment to respond to the climate crisis by selecting the no‐action
alternative."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"The big picture is this: Fossil fuels are relics of previous centuries.  They are dirty, and dangerous to our people and to our precious and fragile planet.  These obsolete fuels should remain in the ground.  "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," The law requires BLM to look not only at how Willow will spur climate change but also at how that climate change will affect the indigenous populations, other people such as recreational users, and commercial fishing,  and the environment.

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," While the temporary hold on further Willow development and the initiation of this supplemental EIS are welcome, nothing short of a full retraction of Conoco-Phillips's project permits will suffice in the face of our climate emergency. With recent events in Ukraine and the embargo on Russian oil, it is clear that the US will need to pursue energy security policies with great urgency. More oil and gas drilling, however, not only represents the path of least imagination and least ambition, but is widely understood to cause and accelerate incalculable environmental harm. The Arctic, though fragile and in a state of rapid melt, remains one of the last bastions of untrammeled nature and biodiversity in the world. The region for which the Willow project is slated is furthermore the ancient homeland of the Inupiat people, whose culture and well-being rely entirely on that specific expanse of land and the wild creatures that it births. It is a challenge for those of us involved in Arctic research and community-development to convey the gravity of what climate change and pollution mean for the region. What books haven't been written, what reports haven't been delivered that might spark a paradigm shift for those still recklessly committed to extractive energy economies? What may seem now like a distant and peripheral part of the planet, when fully obliterated by climate change and broken pipelines, will surely make itself known to all of our children and grandchildren. There is no time to dither in scaling back our energy consumption and rapidly transitioning to renewable energy.

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and extreme temperatures, cost over $145 billion in last year alone. January 2022 was the planet's 6th warmest on record. Furthermore, the World Health Organization predicts that excess deaths worldwide from climate change will continue to increase. 

We must transition away from fossil fuels to an energy system based on cleaner, renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower.

     At this time, I am very disturbed and confused because despite the fact that an environmental impact statement to fully assess the environmental and climate impacts of the Willow Project has not been prepared, the Bureau of Land Management is now rapidly preparing a supplemental environmental impact statement as a step toward advancing a project, that has not been completely evaluated, and any operation of this project will seriously undermine President Biden’s promises and his stated climate goals to stop the pollution of our environment with fossil fuel emissions to combat and reverse the worsening climate change disaster crisis.

Further our world is so heavily dependent on oil for many of the every day products we use from plastic to nylon and everything else in between.  Therefore oil is needed for our current livelihood and we should absolutely rely on safely produced US oil to provide for our economy and national security.

The proximity of the project to the community of Nuiqsut and the potential adverse impacts of the project on subsistence resources and activities are gravely concerning. The speed of development in and adjacent to the Reserve is staggering. Oil and gas development and associated industrial activities in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, Harrison Bay, and nearby state lands are encircling Nuiqsut. BLM must fully analyze the potentially significant adverse effects of the Willow Plan on culture, subsistence, public health, and environmental justice in the context of this rapidly increasing development. BLM and Interior should consider how to empower and support local communities and economies in a just transition to a future without new oil development.

"RTTLSA","Teshekpuk Lake and other Special Areas",,,"ConocoPhillips’ proposed project is also within and adjacent to the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, one of the most productive wetland complexes in the Arctic and an important calving and foraging ground for the Teshekpuk Lake Caribou Herd, an important subsistence resource for communities on the North Slope. It would also place infrastructure in the Colville River Special Area, which provides important habitat to birds as well and subsistence resources. Expanding development in these areas would harm biodiversity and fragment otherwise intact habitat.

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Climate change is with us now, and the effects will only get worse if we continue to behave as we have done for many decades, or a few centuries. We cannot expect a different outcome if we do not change our behaviour.   The vast majority of climate change is driven by carbon dioxide, with methane also contributing significantly. The rise of both of these in the atmosphere stems very largely from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. It is therefore essential, vital in the truest sense of the word, that we immediately reduce fossil fuel consumption. Even current extraction will lock us into decades more release of greenhouse gases. New extraction is therefore unconscionable, reckless in the extreme."

Additional unnecessary delays to this project only further hinder the growth of the Alaska economy and reduce confidence in our state and global partners when making investment decisions. The state of Alaska has proven itself as a global leader in the areas of responsible resource development and I am confident your timely preparation of the 2022 SEIS for the Willow Project will once again show that the state has proactively prepared for this project in a responsible, sustainable and professional manner. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"  The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska—is also the ancient home of the Inupiat people, who have lived there for thousands of years. The Inupiat depend on the region's abundant food resources like caribou to sustain their lives and culture.

I heard that ConocoPhillips wants to place a massive new oil drilling operation—dubbed the ""Willow Project""—which will have a disastrous impact on the region's ecosystem.

Climate change has made the impacts and dangers of fossil fuels more stark, the Willow Project would generate more than 250 million metric tons of CO2 emissions over the 30-year life of the field. To put that in perspective, in the course of an average year of production, this one oil field in Alaska would rank above nearly half the nations on Earth in terms of yearly CO2 emissions!

Please respect the homeland of the Inupiat and the ecosystem that sustains them, and keep fossil fuels in the ground where they belong!"
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"The United State has some of the most stringent environmental protections in place, of which the EIS process is an integral part.  I feel these protections provide a groundwork for responsible development, safely mitigating risks to the animals, birds, land, and stakeholders of Alaska. It seems to me, from a global perspective it is better for a development to be held to the highest standards, versus very low standards potentially afforded in other countries. 
 In my personal and professional opinion, CP has shown itself to operate as a very good corporate citizen, while maintaining and developing oil fields with the highest safety and environmental standards.  I urge you to approve CP’s Supplemental EIS submittal.

This region supports some of the richest ecosystems in the world and it’s time to protect this vitally important region and not treat it like an industrial sacrifice zone. 

The fossil fuels under the Western Arctic hold enough fossil fuels that, if burned, would equal more than double the carbon emissions of burning all the oil that the now-halted Keystone XL pipeline would have carried over its 50-year lifespan. 

The Willow Project  would bring significant drilling infrastructure to a remote region that is warming three times faster than the rest of the world. Because the permafrost is rapidly thawing due to the accelerating impact of climate change, ConocoPhillips has admitted that it will need to artificially chill the melting tundra to sustain this expansive infrastructure."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"  Allowing ConocoPhillips’ Willow Master Development Plan to move forward is dangerously inconsistent with this Administration’s climate agenda and with health, safety, and economic considerations in the US and beyond. In short, it goes against the public interest and must not be allowed on public land. Public lands are a public trust. It will damage sensitive habitat (the threat of oil spills must never be discounted) and result in vast CO2 emissions. ConocoPhillips’ plan could result in the burning of some 590 additional barrels of oil over the next 30 years. We can’t afford that. Protect the Arctic for the sake of the people, plants, and animals that live there—for the sake of life on Earth."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,," Please pick the No Action Alternative for the Willow Master Development Plan (MDP). Especially with the recent news of a gas leak at ConocoPhillips' Alpine site, I strongly oppose the Willow project. It would have significant impacts to the Iñupiat way of life and would cause permanent harm to the community of Nuiqsut. The planned project would develop around the Colville River, or Kuukpik, which is an extremely important and fragile cultural and ecological site. Besides the direct negative impacts of pipelines, gravel pads, roads, noise and pollution, there is the greater overwhelming threat of climate change.

Because the proposed design would be several times larger than nearby oil-drilling operations, the proposal would cause irreversible disruptions to the wildlife there.   These homelands are pristine ecosystems which provide habitat for polar bears, migratory birds, and other iconic species.   

In approving the project, the BLM ignored the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in addressing climate change.

quantify the range of potential population impacts that can be expected with oil development in

based on a species’ full annual cycle. Although resource managers and industry working in 
NPR-A are not responsible for mortalities and habitat loss for Dunlins and the Yellow-billed

... Today, (3/8/22), the White House announced that Russian
petroleum products would be banned from entering the US. The U.K., Europe and other

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"      The willow project will not only create disastrous climate impacts that negatively affect the economy, health of the population and our viability but will also have critical negative impacts on the local biodiversity and local indigenous populations. The negative consequences far outweigh any short term profits."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The best available science informs that Earth’s energy balance can only be restored by returning the atmospheric CO2 concentration to below 350 ppm by 2100. Experts have opined that it is economically and technically feasible to achieve the science-based greenhouse gases (“GHG”) emission reduction target of close to 100% by 2050, while simultaneously enhancing sequestration capacity of sinks to drawdown historical cumulative CO2 emissions, placing the U.S. on an emissions trajectory consistent with returning atmospheric CO2 to below 350 ppm by 2100.
3. Despite the climate crisis Executive Orders of President Biden, U.S. GHG emissions and fossil fuel production are moving in the wrong direction. U.S. economy-wide GHG emissions increased an estimated 6.2% in 2021, while U.S. fossil fuel production is expected to reach a new record high in 2023. How can the federal government or BLM make any claim that they are addressing the climate crisis when there is unabated production of fossil fuels and GHG emissions?
4. Oil and gas are a finite resource whose benefit is invaluable when stored in the ground as a carbon sink (their GHGs not released into the atmosphere), thus preventing further destabilization of the climate system. "
"RTPH","Public Health and Safety",,,"5. Climate change is already adversely impacting the physical and mental health of American children through, among other impacts, extreme weather events, rising temperatures and increased heat exposure, decreased air quality, altered infectious disease patterns, and food and water insecurity. Children are uniquely vulnerable to climate change impacts because of their developing bodies, higher exposure to air, food, and water per unit body weight, unique behavior patterns, dependence on caregivers, political powerlessness, and longevity on the planet. In 2021, the U.S. experienced 20 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, which caused at least 688 direct or indirect fatalities and totaled approximately $145 billion."
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"7. Under the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the government is restrained from engaging in conduct that infringes upon fundamental rights to life, liberty, and property, and equal protection of the law, all of which includes a climate system that sustains human life and liberty. Under the Public Trust Doctrine, embedded in our Constitution and other founding documents, and in the very sovereignty of our Nation, U.S. residents (both present and future, i.e., Posterity) have a right to access and use crucial natural resources, like air and water. The U.S. government, and its executive agencies, have fiduciary duties as trustees to manage, protect, and prevent substantial impairment to our country’s vital natural resources which the government holds in trust for present and future generations.
8. Our children and future generations are suffering injuries with long-lasting and potentially irreversible consequences at present levels of heating and thus BLM must do everything in its power to cease approving fossil fuel projects and facilitate GHG emissions reductions in line with best available science.

"RTGE","General Economics",,,"A 2020 economic analysis by the McDowell Group noted that including all direct, indirect, and induced effects, the oil and gas industry accounted for an annual average of 2,908 jobs and total annual wages of $192 million in the Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB). As such, the development of Willow is important to our community and is broadly supported statewide."

"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I am a scientist who is extremely worried about climate change.  Therefore, I write to ask that the BLM stop ConocoPhillips’ proposed Willow Master Development Plan before it can cause irreparable harm to vital Indigenous communities and habitats in Alaska. President Biden campaigned on “following the science” and tackling the climate crisis. Most of the American people who support the Biden administration are opposed to oil and gas drilling in Alaska.  Action must be taken to prevent the destruction of this already warming region.

A proper scientific investigation of the environmental impacts of oil and gas development in the Greater Willow Area would prove this region should remain off-limits to the fossil fuel industry. I am aware that the federal government historically set aside this area for oil and gas development.  However, the science is clear that we must stop developing fossil fuel extractive industries if we are going to save our arctic ecosystems and mitigate climate change.  

Warming twice as fast as the United States average, Alaska is already reeling from climate change. Willow will produce nearly 200,000 barrels of oil a day -- increasing emissions while putting the local region at risk of a spill. Relying on the petrochemical industry for jobs in Alaska is a losing situation."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"Please do not move forward with this drilling project that will harm us all for the sake of the bottom line of a single company."
"CGW","Caribou and General Wildlife",,,"The Western Arctic supports robust wild ecosystems that include caribou, geese, loons, salmon, polar bears and bowhead whales, and its lands, waters and animals support a number of communities within and adjacent to the Reserve.

"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"Your charter is to ensure the planning process complies with all applicable laws and regulations.    This can only happen if BLM actually analyzes, in full, all potential impacts using a revised draft EIS to critically assess the purpose of the project and develop an appropriate range of alternatives for detailed analysis. A supplemental NEPA analysis is not adequate and this proposal should have also have a scoping period to determine the scale and impacts of the proposed project and identify the
significant issues that require in‐depth analysis.  "
"ENTPS","Stakeholder Engagement",,,"BLM’s prior process to
approve Willow was deeply flawed and did not allow adequate time for public involvement or for a meaningful

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Does the current scoping include any attempt to estimate the complete carbon load that will be added to earth's atmosphere if the 2020 Willow Master Development Plan is allowed to go forward? 

Scoping should include a calculation of the total carbon release, not just from the fuel, energy and resources needed to build infrastructure and begin drilling, but also for the transportation, processing, refining, distribution to market and of course the burning of all the estimated reserves that will be extracted from this project over time.

Since the release of said carbon from the Willow Master Development Plan would be globally distributed, your scoping for the SEIS should also include an assessment of total planetary climate harm that will result from the release of this carbon; i.e. the warming, drought increase, erosion, sea level rise, species and bio-diversity loss, and especially wildfire risk increase for all communities worldwide. 
Please be so good as to start the calculations of this risk assessment of total climate harm worldwide with my home state of California, where last year alone we endured 8,619 wildfires, catastrophically burning over 2,569,009 acres."

"RTGE","General Economics",,,"Willow is estimated to support hundreds of new, permanent, and well-paying jobs, many of which will be union jobs--a remarkable number for any project in Alaska. Many of its jobs will be filled by those who live in the North Slope Borough, while others will help Alaskans who remain unemployed or underemployed in the wake of the pandemic. This is particularly important for an industry that lost an estimated 30 percent of its jobs between 2019 and 2021 due to the pandemic. 

By BLM's own estimates, Willow is projected to generate $2.1 billion for the State of Alaska and $1.2 billion for the NSB at oil prices dramatically lower than what we face today. Higher prices will generate more revenues for governments at all levels. The NSB will use its share of those funds to support valuable community water and sewer infrastructure; educational services, including Alaska's only tribal college; and coastal and climate resiliency projects. "
"RTTAPS","Domestic Oil Production/Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)",,,"The war in Ukraine further underscores the urgency and need for Willow. Oil prices were already high, but have risen even further since the start of Russia's unprovoked atrocities. Countries around the world, especially our own, must shift away from any dependence on Russian energy. The Willow Project and its estimated 160,000 barrels of daily supply can play a major role in making sure that happens. "
"RTEJ","Environmental Justice",,,"Willow also meets the stated goals for the administration's environmental justice initiatives. Approximately three-quarters of the Borough's nearly 10,000 permanent residents are Inupiat, with over 98 percent of Inupiat households living a subsistence lifestyle. Willow will be an example of responsible resource development that meets all local and federal wildlife laws while providing benefits to underserved and minority communities, while successfully balancing the needs of regional subsistence users through strong mitigation measures. "
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) review process for Willow has consisted of a rigorous multi-year environmental analysis with coordination across four federal agencies, the State of Alaska, affected communities on the North Slope, Alaska Native Tribes, and the general public.

"RTPH","Public Health and Safety",,,"The Willow Master Development Plan will harshly impact the local long-time indigenous residents, particularly the Nuiqsut would be assaulted by noise, light, and chemical pollution of their air and water. No matter the amount of caution for movement of fuel, there will be leaks and spills. All of this will lead to increased illness both mental and physical. Most of the local people will not receive the benefit of jobs since nearly all workers will be brought in from outside.

While the Alaska District Court found deficiencies in the Willow Master Development Plan EIS, many aspects were upheld and do not require further analysis in the SEIS. BLM’s SEIS should focus on the specific issues raised by the District Court: climate change analysis, range of alternatives analysis, and aspects of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service biological opinion.

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (Reserve) in the Western Arctic is a critical front for fighting the climate crisis, and the Willow project is the Biden administration’s biggest immediate climate test. Willow is one of the single largest oil extraction projects proposed on federal lands, estimated to add more than 250 million metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere over the next 30 years — equivalent to emissions from 54 million vehicles over an entire year; or, as another comparison, equivalent to annual emissions from 64 new coal fired power plants (more than 1/4 of all U.S. coal plants). The Biden administration simply cannot achieve its climate goals without rejecting the Willow project. 

Climate change is causing temperatures to rise in Arctic Alaska at three times the rate of the rest of the planet, and with each passing year, the Arctic is especially hard hit by destabilizing on-the-ground effects including sea ice melt, permafrost thaw and coastal erosion. Permafrost is an effective storage container for carbon, at risk of release as temperatures continue to warm and permafrost continues to thaw. "

"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"This project is effectively self-defeating, in that the burning of the fossil fuels harvested by this project will dramatically worsen climate change, making it entirely likely Arctic climate-change impacts, such as higher sea levels and melting permafrost, will make it impossible for this project to continue to function, even for its projected financial lifespan.  Overwhelming evidence of the impacts of climate change on the Arctic and the planet are readily available from the IPCC Sixth Assessment (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/  and https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ ) and the Fourth National Climate Assessment (https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/).

Our region stands ready to work on a project like Willow, which will translate into significant economic opportunities."
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"The Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce supports the Willow Master Development Plan submitted to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) by Conoco Phillips."
"RTPH","Public Health and Safety",,,"From a public health perspective, this project would significantly impact air quality, and create more toxics and pollutants that lead to diseases like cancer, asthma, loss of taste and smell, and more. There is robust evidence in the medical literature about the negative health effects induced by proximity to oil wells and drilling sites, and this is only speaking about physical health. "
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,," Please allow Conoco to continue responsibly developing Alaska resources!"
"RTTAPS","Domestic Oil Production/Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)",,,"The Willow Project is in the National Petroleum Reserve-A (NPR-A), on Alaska’s North Slope. In 1923,
Congress specifically set aside and designated the NPR-A, an area larger than the state of Maine, to ensure
American energy independence. The 23 million acre reserve was specifically set aside nearly a century ago for
its petroleum value. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the reserve could hold as much as 9 billion barrels
of oil. Given the vast resources estimated to be in the NPR-A, future production from Willow and other fields
in the NPR-A and Alaska’s North Slope could also reverse recent declines in throughput in the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System (TAPS), maintaining its viability for decades to come. It is paramount that BLM provide access
to prospects in this region with the highest potential as Congress intended. The Willow Project is estimated to
contain as much as 750 million barrels of oil and daily production could exceed 100,000 barrels per day
through TAPS. This production would substantially boost throughput in the TAPS, running at times one-fourth
of its capacity. This would also extend the life of TAPS for decades to come. Clearly, Willow production will
help fulfill the primary purpose of the NPR-A, which is to develop American energy resources."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"This project was halted for failure to appropriately consider climate impact.  It should thus have to face a very strict burden of proof for approval.  Absolute necessity, not just overall benefit, must be demonstrated by ConocoPhillips."

• It will create substantial new revenue for the State of Alaska, which is currently in an economic
crisis.
• It will help maintain “core” state services.
• It will keep and put hundreds, if not thousands, of people to work.
• It will aid in the sustainability of the Trans Alaska Pipeline by adding almost a 20% increase in
production once Willow is fully online.
• It will add infrastructure that can aid in some of the isolated villages in and around the NPR-A by
adding in usable roads. As well as conversations to help maintain their subsistence way of life.
• Conoco Phillips has been operating on the North Slope for 40 years and have operated with the
respect of the North Slope people’s way of life.
This development is crucial to maintaining the State of Alaska. It will also help provide jobs for the many
unions and small businesses that rely on oil company development. Everything from lumber yards, to
grocery stores benefit from this.

"RTEJ","Environmental Justice",,,"The requirements of Environmental Justice EO 12898 to address the disproportionately high
adverse effects of this project on minority, low-income and Alaska Native tribal populations and
underserved communities are partially addressed through the grants funded by royalties from
this project. Projects like Willow are also important in that they meet the requirements of EO
13985 which speaks to addressing racial inequality, social justice and providing jobs to
underserved communities."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"We understand that this Supplemental Environmental-Impact Statement for the Willow
Development is being prepared to address deficiencies identified in the August 21, 2021 U.S.
District Court of Alaska decision. The City of Wainwright urges the BLM to focus only on the
issues identified in the court decision and complete this supplemental NEPA process as quickly as
possible which will enable the project to begin construction during the next winter season."
"PETGSS","General Statement of Support",,,"Thank you for considering our community's concerns and support for the Willow Master
Development Project and our request that a focused Supplemental EIS is completed as soon as
possible."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"We respectfully request that
BLM limit its supplemental review to address only the issues specifically identified by Judge
Gleason as in need of supplemental analysis before Willow can proceed: namely, those issues
related to BLM’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions analysis, BLM’s NEPA alternatives analysis
(specifically, the issues Judge Gleason identified related to BLM’s authority to restrict CPAI’s
lease rights and the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area), and the agency’s reliance on the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service’s Biological Opinion for polar bear."
"RTTAPS","Domestic Oil Production/Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)",,,"In 2021, the United States imported an average of 670,000 barrels of oil and petroleum
products, with a high of 848,000 barrels per day in June 2021, with imports up 24% in 2021 over
2020. The development potential at Willow and elsewhere on the North Slope could play a
critical role in reducing these foreign imports and meeting our domestic energy needs.
It is an undeniable truth that oil and gas remain a critically important part of America’s economy
and of our national security strategy."
"ENPTEPT","EIS Process/Timeline",,,"We understand that CPAI is prepared to start construction by the 2022-2023 winter season to bring this project to fruition and to start bringing the benefits of this development to the people of the North Slope as soon as this year. Every delay of Willow consequently delays Willow’s benefits to North Slope communities and our people. ASRC reiterates the message that timely completion of the Willow SEIS is essential, and that BLM should complete its SEIS as expeditiously as possible in order to allow this important project to move forward."
"RTGE","General Economics",,," Willow is slated to bring
significant economic benefits to the North Slope and to ASRC’s Native shareholders. Oil and
gas revenues have compromised 80% of the State of Alaska’s general fund revenue since
1977, and oil and gas property taxes annually account for more than 95% of the Borough’s tax
receipts. BLM estimates that Willow will result in approximately $6 billion from federal royalties
and state and local taxes for the State of Alaska and the North Slope’s regional government
alone. Such tax revenues from oil and gas development enable the Borough to provide and
invest in public infrastructure and utilities and other services across multiple communities,
including education, health care, and emergency services."
"S","Subsistence",,,"exploration and
development require construction of roads and other local infrastructure that has intrinsic benefit
to the local communities. Road connectivity in particular is viewed by many local residents as a
significant benefit, and is supported by our elected leadership, because it lowers the cost of
goods and services and provides greater access for subsistence activities. Willow will bring
increased road connectivity and improved access to subsistence resources to the village of
Nuiqsut, providing the community with year-round road access for subsistence activities."
"ATT03","Request for Cooperating Agency Status",,,"We appreciate that BLM has sought to work with affected Alaska Native Corporations throughout Willow’s development, and that BLM’s Notice indicates that it will continue to consult with Alaska Native Corporations under the Department of the Interior’s Policy on Consultation with Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Corporations (Aug. 10, 2012). We encourage the agency to continue to ensure that consultation with Alaska Native Corporations is more than merely a check-the-box exercise, because although legally mandated,8 consultation is ultimately intended to inform and improve federal decision making. "
"PETMTMI","Mitigation or Minimization",,,"The current plan for Willow’s footprint was specifically designed to protect
surface values and to protect the Iñupiat way of life, including our reliance on subsistence
harvesting. We remain satisfied that the mitigation measures are adequate to protect the land,
water, and wildlife resources of the North Slope, as well as community health and wellbeing.
Accordingly, additional mitigation measures are not necessary. Willow’s current design is the
culmination of a years-long process involving local stakeholders, and it reflects the input and
values of the Iñupiat people of the North Slope on CPAI’s overall project design and in the
alternatives presented in the EIS."
"ATT09","Request for New Analysis",,,"We also request that if an SEIS is prepared, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) work closely with local leaders and health authorities to include in it a long-overdue Health Impact Assessment of the potential damage from Willow and other ongoing and planned oil and gas development on the North Slope to the health of community residents and their traditional food supplies. "
"ATT09","Request for New Analysis",,,"Should BLM proceed with an SEIS, it should not limit the scope to those errors identified by the District Court. Some time ago, BLM worked closely with North Slope community leaders to produce a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) of the cumulative impacts of regional oil and gas development on local residents, integrating it into National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation for a development plan. Though BLM was not sued for omitting an HIA from the Willow NEPA process, its failure to include one was egregious. A great many advances have been made in the scientific study of such effects over the intervening years. Neither the agency, the affected public, nor policymakers can properly evaluate the Willow proposal without bringing that research to bear on its impacts analysis, together with up-to-date information from residents of the region. "
"RTCC","Climate Change",,,"Assuming BLM prepares an SEIS undertaking to correct its unsubstantiated and insupportable assumption that in foreign markets Willow’s production would wholly displace other fossil fuel supply, that analysis will underscore the folly of authorizing Willow. In a net zero emissions scenario where the world keeps close to the vital 1.5◦C average warming limit, “the fall in oil demand and prices does not justify investments in new fields after 2021.” Willow’s production in that case might result in only moderate net carbon emissions, because without Willow other producers would probably largely make up its forgone production. But there would also be no legitimate demand for its oil if it proceeds, nothing at all to justify the risks, costs, damage, and investments, as well as whatever incremental increase in radiative forcing would result. Conversely, global failure to adopt clean alternatives would leave demand for oil in place, but the climate consequences of Willow would be all that much more dire. When demand is high, the elasticity of oil supply is correspondingly lower, and other oil sources substitute much less for forgone production. As result, much more of Willow’s oil would generate additive consumption and the associated emissions, substantially worsening an unfolding disaster. In short, either Willow’s production will be pointless or it will be particularly harmful. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"The climate crisis is already imperiling our country and costing taxpayers billions. President Biden has committed to reducing greenhouse gas pollution by at least 50% by 2030 and meeting net-zero emissions by 2050. Hitting these metrics will help us avoid the worst of the crisis—and any fair analysis would demonstrate that the Willow project is deeply incompatible with these commitments."
"RTGE","General Economics",,,"WHEREAS, among the Borough's Home Rule powers is the statutory authority to tax
infrastructure for oil and gas development. The Borough's primary source of revenue derives from taxes
levied on oil and gas infrastructure. These revenues provide significant economic benefit to the Borough
and contribute funds that enable the Borough to provide essential services to its eight communities,
including the City, and to employ many of its residents. The Borough is also the major employer in the
City, and
WHEREAS, the City is also located within the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (''NPRA"") and is considered an impacted community with respect to oil and gas development in NPR-A, and
WHEREAS, fifty percent of the revenue generated by oil and gas development is paid into the
NPR-A Impact Grant Funds (""Grant"") managed by the State of Alaska. The City is a recipient of and
uses its Grant funds to provide for community projects to off-set the effects of oil and gas exploration
and development to our residents"
"RTGE","General Economics",,,"WHEREAS, as the North Slope oil fields decline, it is vitally important to the City and the
Borough that new fields, like the Willow Project, are developed to provide much needed revenue to the
Borough from property taxes; and
WHEREAS, as an example, the Willow Project over its expected field life, is estimated to provide
$2.6 billion to the Grant Fund to communities most affected by oil and gas production in the NPR-A. And
is estimated to provide an additional $1.2 billion to the Borough through taxes, which means there will be
significant funding made available to further improve living conditions, schools, and basic infrastructure
for North Slope communities"
"RTTAPS","Domestic Oil Production/Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)",,,"Curtailing
energy production in the United States forces our country and our allies to purchase oil and gas
from countries like Russia, even as these countries impose economic sanctions on Russia for
its attacks against Ukraine. The United States should be supporting the development of our domestic energy resources to bolster our national security interests and to ensure that the
benefits of resource development flow to U.S. communities instead of foreign enemies."
"RTGE","General Economics",,,"Willow will also bring jobs to the state and to local communities. Oil and gas development
projects on the North Slope present significant employment opportunities for ASRC and our
shareholders through opportunities for ASRC’s subsidiaries, including ASRC Energy Services,
LLC, to contract with project operators such as CPAI. This, in turn, translates to meaningful,
long-term employment for many of our Alaska Native shareholders. In addition to increased
employment, these contracting opportunities would result in increased dividends provided
directly to ASRC shareholders, which help our shareholders pay for housing and defray the high
costs associated with life on the North Slope. Such economic relief is desperately needed as
Alaska Native communities devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic struggle to get back on their
feet."
"RTNE","Nuiqsut Economics",,,"North Slope communities—Nuiqsut in particular—will benefit from Willow’s
mandated contributions to the NPR-A Impact Grant Program. Willow is projected to add over
$2.5 billion to the Program, and those funds will be available for local grant requests. "
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"Allowing ConocoPhillips' Willow project to move forward is hypocritical and highly inconsistent with this Administration’s climate agenda, and could result in the burning of an additional 590 million barrels of oil over 30 years."
"PETGSO","General Statement of Opposition",,,"I urge you to stop ConocoPhillips’ disastrous Western Arctic drilling plan."
