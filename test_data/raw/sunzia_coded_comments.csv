"TRA01","01 general comments","TRA","Traffic and Travel Mgt","Experiencing the terrain and road system of the Santa Rita Ranches’ area makes transportation difficult and especially when there is rain which can turn the road surfaces to “grease” due to the geologic makeup of the dirt in the area.
•	To my knowledge there are two ways to reach Santa Rita Ranches. One way is from Magdalena over a sandy gravel road which can be difficult to traverse because of the sand and dunes on the sides of the road. The other entrance is off I-25 in Bernardo where you have to cross the Rio Puerco via an historic truss bridge then travel BLM roads and then do a bridgeless recrossing of the Rio Puerco closer to the Santa Rita Ranch entrance.

I don’t mind the rough travel because it allows Santa Rita to keep its natural habitat. The rough terrain allows nature to take its course, a place where wildlife can make a home away from the stresses of man. Santa Rita is a place of tranquility where you can be at peace with the world and enjoy a beautiful New Mexico sunrise or sunset or watch elk grazing or go on a geology hike. To interrupt this setting with man-made atrocities such as high-voltage lines is unconscionable."

"WL01","01 general comments","WL","Wildlife  incl SSS","My only comment for the moment, it that I am concerned that the Sandhill Cranes will not be
cognizant of the power lines with the few number of visibility balls that are installed at the moment.
Since the birds have already migrated north this year, the accidents will not be noted until the fall.
We see many birds that are killed in the fields around the river valley when they fly into the lower
residential type of power lines. Since the SunZia lines are much higher, denser in number (and new)
there may be a higher incidence of mortality when larger groups are flying through the area, rather
than just between fields.

I can not tell from the project PDF’s where the final lines will go, however, currently I am assuming
that there will only be one Rio Grande river crossing and that will be where the lines and poles have
already been put in place."

"WL01","01 general comments","WL","Wildlife  incl SSS","Most alarming is SunZia’s proposal to string two 500-kilovolt
transmission lines over the Rio Grande, a critically important migratory
bird corridor. High voltage transmission lines crossing a major bird
flyway will fragment the migratory corridor and will certainly kill
birds.
New Mexico's Rio Grande Corridor is one of the most important and
fragile migratory bird zones in North America.
Over 350 species of birds traveling from eleven states funnel down
New Mexico’s Middle Rio Grande corridor during their annual
migrations. Among these birds are the Rocky Mountain population of
sandhill cranes, snow geese, Ross’s geese and ducks.
All of these birds fly close along the river with many of them wintering
at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, just south of the
proposed project river crossing. Other nearby refuges and wildlife
management that draw migrating birds include the Ladd S. Gordon
Waterfowl Management Area, Sevilleta NWR, and the Valle de Oro
NWR.
The bird populations that use the Middle Rio Grande Corridor are
already hard-pressed. Climate change and development are leaving
them fewer places to rest and feed. The riparian cottonwood forest in
the Middle Rio Grande Valley is dwindling.
For decades, the NMWF and many other conservation groups have
worked to protect this precarious and threatened ecosystem. SunZia's
transmission lines pose a major threat to this landscape-scale
conservation effort now and in the future."

The Federal Government should take a more proactive approach in transmission line permitting and requirements. Given the significant environmental impacts caused by transmission lines to the human and natural environment, care must be taken to ensure that the proposals are both necessary and environmentally compatible.

There are many environmental studies and reports on the areas of New Mexico and Arizona that will be affected by the SunZia proposal. These regions hold significant indigenous species of plants, mammals, and other animals, including mountain lions in the Sierra Ladrones; the endangered Mexican Wolf (which is making a comeback in the area); countless migratory bird, insect, and other populations that use the region for important seasonal thoroughfares (National Geographic interactive map; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation annual report); and
- among other examples - the Socorro Springsnail, found only in Socorro County, New Mexico.
 

This tiny freshwater snail, a minute mollusk, is considered the most endangered of all animals in the state of New Mexico.
Any basic google searches of these areas and the prolific and unique ecosystems they support would save someone at SunZia or the BLM a caboodle on research and surveying for the Environmental Impact Statement.

Where to even begin here? The effects of high-voltage power lines are still understudied and little understood, even while the giant systems continue to be raised.
Levels of electromagnetic fields emitted by high-voltage power lines are hard to quantify and depend on many variables; therefore, accurately gauging the exposure to nearby humans and environments is tricky. Undeniably, the closer in proximity the power lines are to specific people and places, as well as the amount of time spent within their exposure, increases the negative impacts that are possible. It is also practically impossible to shield EMFs from homes and habitats.
What choice will landowners or animals, birds, insects, and other life have to escape the EMF zone of the 550+ miles of SunZia’s lines?

In addition to die acquisition of the Valle de Oro NWR, these NA WCA funds - secured and managed by Rio Grande Return and New Mexico Wildlife Federation - have been used to restore and enhance 3,486 of acres of habitat within the aforementioned state Wildlife Management Units (WMU) and fedeml refuges within the MR.G. Perhaps most importantly, a portion of the NA WCA funding has gone to the protection of 1,300 acres of key habitat on private lands through conservation easements to help alleviate habitat fragmentation by preserving and enhancing some important lands between the federal refuges and state WMU's. Most of these conservation easements are in the MRG, most are proximate to the Rio Grande, and several are in close proximity to the proposed Sun Zia routes - La Joya Fanns most significantly. We are concerned that these ongoing efforts by Rio Grande Return and more than SO partner stakeholders to address the increasing fragmentation of the remaining suite of wetlands in the MRG will be further compromised by overhead transmission lines that would cross the Rio Grande anywhere in the MRG.

There is likely no place in the continental United States that a transmission line would have a greater negative impact on migratory birds than the MRG. 
The impacts to wildlife may differ slightly with regard to the three alternative routes proposed in this EIS where the Sun Zia transmission lines would cross the MRG, but in the context of how important it is to preserve the integrity of this narrow stretch of migratory corridor to the numerous agencies, organizations, and landowners working on behalf of the hundreds of species of birds occupying seven states and three countries, fully understanding the consequences of compromising this corridor in any way takes precedence to the pros and cons of specific crossings and for so many of us remains the overarching concern.

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Corona generation and gap discharges from electric power transmission lines generate radio noise 
during their normal operation. These discharges can create EMI that can affect all types of electronics 
including cell phones, radios, and TVs. There are even studies that show the EMI can have 
detrimental health effects. Due to the remoteness of Riley(Santa Rita), it is already difficult to obtain a 
cell signal due to topographic effects, being on the fringe of coverage, and frankly being on the wrong 
side of geography from where cell phone providers earn their revenue, i.e. population centers. One of 
the most renowned radiotelescopes in the world, the Very Large Array is approximately 25 miles from 
this route. Radiotelescopes are extremely sensitive to EMI of all kinds.
EMI can affect nearby vegetation. EMI is a “noise” to radio signals. One might call it the invisible 
pollution of the radio spectrum.

The Estate is an ""impacted landowner,"" along the SunZia Transmission route (Route).

Our client supports Sun Zia's proposed transition to clean, renewable energy that the Project will cause to be created, according to Sun Zia. In addition, our client supports Sun Zia's efforts to provide a transmission infrastructure for the Project that should have the effect of both stabilizing and attempting to protect the Project's electrical grid. 

Further, our client supports and further approves of and appreciates Sun Zia's proposed efforts to relocate the grid lines outside of the ""Northern Call Up Area,"" in hopes of preserving ongoing military testing and its existing training areas. 

Last, but surely not least, our client expresses its appreciation for Sun Zia's apparent efforts to co-locate and/or parallel, with now existing transmission infrastructure in the State of New Mexico, including, but not limited to that certain recently constructed Western Spirit Transmission Line (Western Spirit), which our client was also previously involved with, prior to its approval by the BLM, and Western Spirit's recent construction in Southern New Mexico. 

In summary, the Estate urges the BLM and yourself to work cooperatively with Sun Zia, and to grant to it, and its representatives all of the courtesies, assistance, respect and cooperation which you previously offered to Western Spirit, and to approve any and all of Sun Zia's efforts referred to herein, and/or in the EIS, and, based upon your judicious and knowledgeable judgment, approve the Project, as soon as possible.

"PN04","Applicant PN","PN","Purpose and Need","New Mexico has historically been an exporter of thermal-sourced power supply to markets such as California, Arizona, and Texas. As states and corporations increasingly move toward clean energy resources, the vast renewable resource potential in New Mexico creates an opportunity for the state to become a major supplier of clean energy needs of other states while continuing to serve the needs of in-state customers. 

In June 2020, NM RETA released findings from a landmark: Energy Transmission and Storage Study compiled by Virginia-based energy company ICF Consultants that specifically looked at this potential. The study examined the development potential for renewables to serve in-state and out-of-state demand over the next 10 years, and the transmission system alternatives that could support the interconnection of those renewables to New Mexico and export to areas of demand while maintaining system reliability requirements.
Based on the findings, New Mexico has more than enough renewable energy and capacity to meet residential and business electricity demands in advance of New Mexico's Energy Transition Act's (ETA) requirement for 100% zero-carbon electricity for utilities by 2045 and rural electric cooperatives by 2050. It also identified that New Mexico's renewable capacity could expand from 2,500 MW as of the end of 2019 to 11,500 MW by 2030. This consists of 2,500 MW existing, 3,100 MW currently under development and 5,900 MW of new projects identified as a part of this study. The 11,500 MW would satisfy New Mexico's clean energy goals as well as support the goals of other states. 

To support the -addition of renewables at this scale, roughly 900 to 1300 miles of new transmission and supporting equipment is required. ICF Consultants identified the greatest value for transmission would be to expand capabilities to the western states. The investment made in support of renewables and transmission reflects up to $11 billion through 2032 by project developers resulting in up to 3,700 jobs per year during peak construction plus up to 800 permanent jobs.

Adding an extra transmission corridor to connect New Mexico to the neighboring markets was identified as the top priority in the Study. It also identified that existing transmission corridors were preferred over new corridors in order to minimize the need for acquisition and permitting of new right-of-way (ROW). The SunZia project meets this priority by providing new infrastructure to reach western m·arkets with the ability to co-locate with existing infrastructure in order to minimize impacts."

As a co-development partner, NM.RETA will have an integral voice in all decisions related to the development of SunZia Line. 

As a New Mexico state authority, NMRET A will ensure that the concerns and priorities of New Mexicans are considered over the course of SunZia's development. 

 NMRET A also has an environmental review process that is coupled with its independent board. The NMRETA board is comprised of the State Treasurer Cabinet Secretary of the Energy Minerals & Natural Resources Department, three appointees from the Governor, and appointees from both the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Senate President Pro Tempore. The elected and appointed officials, working with their staff experts, guide decisions that are in the best interest of New Mexico. ln addition, NMRETA provides regular updates to an interim committee of the NM Legislature, the New Mexico Finance Authority Oversight Committee.

On still days, this area of the Southwest is some of the purest there is. Historically, it was even sometimes called the “well country” for sufferers of tuberculosis and other lung ailments who moved to sanitariums, especially in New Mexico, to breathe easier in the fresh, dry air. 

Tests increasingly show that a buildup of static electricity around power lines attracts particulates in the air and carries them to the area, where they accumulate. This problem is made worse if power lines are located close to other sources of pollution (like the many sources inherent to large-scale construction sites). Pollutants are often made up of a mixture of contaminants that can then become charged by the electricity running through the power lines. In turn, breathing in charged particles has been linked to many adverse health effects, including cancer.

High voltage transmission lines can be a significant impediment to fighting fires. There are significant 
power line hazards that are present to personnel fighting fires.13 The Santa Rita Ranches community 
does not have installed fire equipment. Wildland fires already present a risk in that area due to the lack
of water. This is a risk that the landowners accepted when purchasing their property, but this risk could
be significantly exacerbated by the presence of the transmission lines both by making it more difficult 
to fight fires in the presence of the transmission lines and also the possibility that the transmission 
lines could contribute to the possibility of a fire. Vegetation management and other measures can 
mitigate some of that risk, but of course eliminating vegetation is also environmentally detrimental, 
especially in desert landscapes. Transmission lines present in an area can make fires more prevalent 
due to weather related events, inadvertent contact with vegetation or other items , equipment failure,

Gas and electric companies can face lawsuits for their responsibility in igniting wildfires and endangering, maiming, and killing animals and humans, as well as their habitats.  

Every year in recent memory, the wildfire seasons have been more devastating than the ones before. Currently, there are hundreds of thousands of acres burning across the proposed SunZia project area. It seems ill-advised to increase this risk. "

Much of the land to be trespassed by the SunZia project, as well as the surrounding areas, are already protected and have/will require special designations to interrupt. 

Why bother forming and protecting areas like the Sevilleta and Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuges; the Sierra Ladrones Wilderness Study Area; the Cibola, Gila, Coronado, and other National Forests; Saguaro National Park; and so many others if a company like SunZia can come in and get special designations for use despite the many likely and negative environmental impacts?

They are full of archeological and paleontological sites that are rife with pottery and other artifacts, ancient fossils, historic landscapes, and much, much more.

Along with the state and nationally protected lands that are home to these exquisite and fading sites, archeological and paleontological locations can be found simply by exploring properties and roadsides along the proposed SunZia routes.

Having trekked just a small percentage of this acreage, I can attest to finding: potsherds and beads from multiple sites and eras of indigenous occupation; fossilized marine invertebrates from when the area was part of a large inland sea; manos and matates from ancient natives going about their chores; historical buildings and cemeteries; remnants of old cowboy camps; the delicate imprint of ferns from bygone geologic periods; etc.

a.	If SunZia’s objective is to move New Mexico’s wind energy into southern and central Arizona, the Southline Transmission Project has already provided an east-west pathway that does not follow the region’s last remaining natural desert river ecosystems and other untouched areas. SunZia should consider routes located east of the White Sands Missile Range, routes that ultimately would connect to the Southline project in southern New Mexico. There is no urgent need to duplicate the function of the Southline project, particularly since Southline has surpassed SunZia in the permitting process and has avoided following the major ecosystems in the region by co-locating most of their transmission project with established industrial-scale infrastructure corridors.
 

b.	If national energy policy is truly focused on replacing fossil-fueled energy with renewable energy, SunZia should consider a route that parallels Highway 60 westward from Socorro County to the large coal-fired generators located in Springerville, Arizona. This route could begin at the Rio Grande crossing that is co-located with the planned and permitted Western Spirit line. Such a route would avoid requiring amendments to the Rio Grande conservation plans associated with the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge and the Cibola National Forest, as well as avoid construction of a new industrial-scale infrastructure corridors parallel to both the Rio Grande and San Pedro River. This route alternative is similar in design concept to the Western Spirit Line, in that it minimizes the distance and impacts of a renewable energy tie-line by connecting to the Western Grid at the closest access point where transmission capacity is being freed up with the retirement of coal-fired energy."

Riparian habitats support ecological processes and diverse assemblages of distinctive species that are not found in the surrounding uplands (Stevens et al. 1977, Minckley and Brown 1994). 

Despite their great ecological importance, land management activities such as flow regulation and other anthropogenic activities have substantially compromised the ecological integrity of stream, wetland, and riparian ecosystems throughout North America (Minckley and Brown 1994, Dale et al. 2000) and in the MRG in particular. Estimates of riparian habitat loss range from 40% to 90% in the arid southwestern states (Dahl 1990), and riparian habitats are considered to be one of the region's most endangered ecosystems (Minckley and Brown 1994, Noss et al. 1995). 

Because of the increasing impacts of climate change, prolonged drought and urban development in the historic floodplain, the loss of wetland habitat in the MRG now likely exceeds the higher range of Dahl's estimates that were published in 2000.

"CC01","01 general comments","CC","Climate Change","iverine and riparian ecosystems are the most productive, biologically diverse, and threatened habitats in the American Southwest (Johnson and Jones 1977, Johnson et al. 1985, Knopf et al.1988, Ohmart et al. 1988, Johnson 1991, Minckley and Brown 1994). Riparian habitats support ecological processes and diverse assemblages of distinctive species that are not found in the surrounding uplands (Stevens et al. 1977, Minckley and Brown 1994). 

Despite their great ecological importance, land management activities such as flow regulation and other anthropogenic activities have substantially compromised the ecological integrity of stream, wetland, and riparian ecosystems throughout North America (Minckley and Brown 1994, Dale et al. 2000) and in the MRG in particular. Estimates of riparian habitat loss range from 40% to 90% in the arid southwestern states (Dahl 1990), and riparian habitats are considered to be one of the region's most endangered ecosystems (Minckley and Brown 1994, Noss et al. 1995). 

Because of the increasing impacts of climate change, prolonged drought and urban development in the historic floodplain, the loss of wetland habitat in the MRG now likely exceeds the higher range of Dahl's estimates that were published in 2000. As a consequence, the hundreds of thousands of birds that have been migrating through and wintering in the MRG for millions of years are now dependent on 5% to 10% of the wetlands habitat that have supported them historically.

"WL01","01 general comments","WL","Wildlife  incl SSS","The State of New Mexico has developed a Long-range Management Plan for Sandhill
Cranes and this species is a New Mexico Species of Greatest Conservation Need as
identified in the State Wildlife Action Plan (NMDGF 2003 and 2006). However, the
primary authority for management of the species lies with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service. There is one species of crane found in New Mexico, the Sandhill Crane ( Grus
canadensis), with three identified subspecies found in the state: Lessers (G.c. canadensis),
Canadians (G.c. rowani) and Greaters (G.c. tabida) (NMDGF 2003). Migration and
wintering areas are of concern in New Mexico. These areas are described in the New
Mexico Department of Game and Fish's Long-Range Plan, but, briefly, include the entire
Rio Grande Valley from the Colorado line to northern Dona Ana County, the Pecos River
watershed from Roswell to Carlsbad, and from Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge in
western San Miguel County southwest to the Middle Rio Grande Valley.

The Middle Rio Grande Valley is a narrow corridor that is used by hundreds of thousands of migrating and wintering waterbirds. The MRG has been identified as the most critical landscape in the annual cycle of the Rocky Mountain population of Sandhill Cranes (approx. 20,000 annually in the population) due to the density of wintering birds in one location, the limited availability of foods (natural and wintering), and the small size of this wintering area (Taylor 1999). Research across all Sandhill Crane populations indicates the single most important factor regulating Sandhill Crane populations is habitat availability (Tacha et al. 1992). Understanding the importance of the MR.G valley in the context of population viability is essential when evaluating potential anthropogenic impacts. 

Located on the southern end of the Central Flyway and along the key migration corridor of the Rocky Mountain population of Sandhill Cranes, the Middle Rio Grande Valley, has been integral in the rebuilding and protection of this waterbird population. During the early 1900's the Rocky Mountain population of Sandhill Cranes numbers plummeted due to habitat alteration, land fragmentation, and human population growth (Taylor 1999). By the 1940's, the population was close to extinction and estimated to be fewer than 400 birds. Efforts to protect habitat, restore wetlands, and enhance existing natural and agricultural habitats in combination with sound population management practices has helped the species recover to between 18,000 and 20,000 birds annually (Taylor 1999).
 
Recently, a subgroup of The Migratory Shore and Upland Game Bird Support Task Force focused on establishing the top priority information needs for migratory populations of Sandhill Cranes (Vradenburg, personal communication, April 2010). One of the outcomes of this effort was the finding that the most limiting landscape in the annual cycle of Sandhill Cranes, specifically the Rocky Mountain population, is the Middle Rio Grande Valley and further alterations to the valley could be population compromising. Many geographic constrictions occur in the Middle Rio Grande Valley which limit the energetic potential of the valley, concentrates the Sandhill Crane population for an extended period, and places them in proximity to large concentrations of other migratory waterbirds. Due the valley's size there are limited habitat resources for foraging and roosting which are becoming increasingly limited due to habitat conversion and degradation resulting from water loss and urbanization. There are limited opportunities for conservation (wetland and agriculturall) so there is a sense of urgency to get lands protected to assure longevity of the resources needed by migrating and wintering waterbirds.

As with many things, the fight for environmental justice is stymied by lack of access.

Not only is it already difficult to ensure equal access to the decision-making process in situations like this proposal, but also, SunZia is doing no member of the public any favors in being forthcoming or helpful throughout the process. 

Personally, my family found out about this project two months ago. Luckily, we were able to scour websites, make calls, write e-mails, attend Zoom meetings, and spend time and energy on scrambling to fill in the unending blanks and gaps in information that arose in dealings with SunZia and the BLM with respect to the project. The latter’s values are to serve with honesty, integrity, accountability, respect, courage, and commitment, which then quizzically elicits the question of why it is so disparagingly difficult to get straight answers from either group about the particulars of the project and our many concerns.

Where to even begin here? The effects of high-voltage power lines are still understudied and little understood, even while the giant systems continue to be raised.

Levels of electromagnetic fields emitted by high-voltage power lines are hard to quantify and depend on many variables; therefore, accurately gauging the exposure to nearby humans and environments is tricky. Undeniably, the closer in proximity the power lines are to specific people and places, as well as the amount of time spent within their exposure, increases the negative impacts that are possible. It is also practically impossible to shield EMFs from homes and habitats.

Given the trend of the SunZia proposal toward increasing adverse ecological impacts to delicate ecosystems in the region and the new perspectives the nation has gained during the past decade about the importance of minimizing the length and impacts of proposed tie-lines for renewable energy transmission, it is essential that project abandonment be analyzed as an alternative in the next EIS. This can be analyzed in terms of both positive and negative impacts. When a project proposal languishes for such a long period of time and is surpassed in permitting by other transmission proposals that avoided paralleling sensitive river and other ecosystems in the region, this abandonment alternative must be analyzed for the sake of the future generations that the BLM mission purports to sustain. Analyzing project abandonment as an independent alternative is reasonable because it is the most direct way to consider if it is a good idea for federal agencies to amend additional resources management plans for a project that has embraced a highly controversial design concept from the beginning.

a. Renewable energy resources are often harnessed hundreds of miles from urban areas which are located far from the existing electrical grid. Before these stranded renewable energy resources can be used by residential and business consumers, a delivery system must be in place to transport that energy from its source. SunZia could instead encourage the development of other smaller-scale wind and solar farms along its route, all of which will help meet the growing demand for new renewable energy without excising huge swaths of terrain for transport and access along “mega-corridors”."

By the 1940’s, the population was estimated to be fewer than 400 birds. Efforts to protect habitat, restore wetlands, and enhance existing natural and agricultural habitats in combination with sound population management practices helped the species recover to between 18,000 and 20,000 birds annually (Taylor 1999).

As with many things, the fight for environmental justice is stymied by lack of access. In the region of the SunZia development, there are many New Mexicans and Arizonans whose voices will be left out of these public discussions and comment submissions due to obstacles like lack of access to computers or internet, lack of time or financial resources to devote to research and meetings, lack of legal advocacy, and more. Not only is it already difficult to ensure equal access to the decision-making process in situations like this proposal, but also, SunZia is doing no member of the public any favors in being forthcoming or helpful throughout the process.

Personally, my family found out about this project two months ago. Luckily, we were able to scour websites, make calls, write e-mails, attend Zoom meetings, and spend time and energy on scrambling to fill in the unending blanks and gaps in information that arose in dealings with SunZia and the BLM with respect to the project. The latter’s values are to serve with honesty, integrity, accountability, respect, courage, and commitment, which then quizzically elicits the question of why it is so disparagingly difficult to get straight answers from either group about the particulars of the project and our many concerns."

During spring and fall migration, the shorelines, mudflats, and sandbars of the reservoir and river in this area provide important feeding grounds for migrating shorebirds and waterbirds that need to refuel during their journey along the river corridor. The waters of the Rio Grande in this area also support valuable riparian forests and marshes which host breeding populations of many neotropical migrants such as warblers, tanagers, and flycatchers, and these same riparian habitats are critical migration stopovers for other species that breed farther north."

"WL04","04 analysis and methodology","WL","Wildlife  incl SSS","Greater Sandhill Cranes – A Species Particularly Vulnerable to Transmission Collision Mortality

Our concerns about the potential impacts of transmission collision mortality on greater sandhill cranes are based on the biology of the species as well as the landscape context. As a group, the configuration of their vision makes cranes particularly vulnerable to transmission line collision mortality. Crane vision is optimized for taking food with the bill at short range, using direct visual guidance accurately and gauge distance. They have a relatively narrow horizontal binocular visual field of 15-10 degrees and substantial parts of the frontal hemisphere have no coverage. This lack of visual coverage in the direction of flight likely contributes to collision probability. Cranes are also not able to see far above in the vertical dimension. Birds are often able to see power carrying conductors of a transmission line at greater distances and shift their flight paths in response, then see the thinner and less visible overhead shield wire that protects the other lines from lightning strikes at the last minute. In this situation, the overhead shield wire is often narrowly avoided through flaring of the wings and rapid upward flight. It may not be possible for cranes to see the shield wire in this context given their narrow vertical field of vision.5 This, combined with their heavy wing loading and lack of maneuverability, may put them at greater risk with respect to other species.

Sandhill crane mortality has been well documented for over six decades, starting in 1945 and with a number of notable mass mortality events over the years.6 Drewien7 estimated that 37% of mortality in the Rocky Mountain population was due to collisions with power lines, particularly power lines between feeding and roosting habitats where low altitude flights occur frequently at dawn and dusk when visibility is low, an assertion supported by studies in other areas.8 Brown et al.9 suggest that new transmission lines should not be constructed within 2 km of roosts or feeding sites. Increased collision mortality during inclement weather and low visibility conditions has also been noted consistently across the years in multiple studies (Walkinshaw 1956, Wheeler 1966, Nesbitt and Gilbert 1976, Tacha et al. 1979).10
Greater sandhill cranes were the most common bird species detected during mortality surveys in the San Luis Valley ~260 miles north of the proposed SunZia MRG crossing, and juvenile greater sandhill cranes represented significantly more of this mortality (30%) than adults (4.7%). These birds collided making low level flights between wetland roosts and feeding areas (croplands), with collisions occurring frequently during windy conditions.11 Given that sandhill cranes have the lowest annual recruitment of any game bird species in North America and typically don’t reproduce until their third year, the effects of increases in long-term juvenile mortality are of great concern, and highlight the need for a thorough risk assessment along with a coherent program to offset impacts should an overhead MRG crossing be chosen as the preferred alternative in the final EIS.

Effectiveness of marking power lines to minimize greater sandhill crane collision varies by type of marker used, power line configuration in horizontal and vertical space, marker density, and by many site-specific factors. The studies cited above that examined efficacy of marking lines all showed they reduced mortality significantly compared to unmarked lines and resulted in over 50% mortality reduction. Enhancing this deterrent effect through near UV illumination of markers increased effectiveness to 95% at Audubon’s Rowe Sanctuary, but this was a preliminary study done in a context where greater sandhill cranes roost directly below lines and flush up into them—fundamentally different than a SunZia MGR crossing."

Some of the BLM’s guiding principles are supposedly to cultivate community-based conservation, citizen-centered stewardship, and partnership through consultation, cooperation, and communication.

How, exactly, has the Transmission Project fulfilled these principles? What does the SunZia project do to enhance the lives of individual and family landowners, retirees, small
 

farmers and ranchers, or nearby native populations who experience particular socio-economic difficulties different than many of their urban and suburban peers? What is proposed?
In my and my family’s dealings with SunZia so far, each of the above principles has been sorely unapparent.

With all these concerns, what recourse is there?"

There are pottery shards strewn about the land. Much of it is Socorro black-on-white, which can be dated as far back as the 10th century.  To build the transmission lines through this area would destroy the cultural heritage and archaeological treasures it holds. Riley is also a documented ghost town, an authentic vestige of the Old West that would be coopted and have its character ruined by the intrusion and eyesore of large modern power structures. The small cemetery there includes the grave of Deputy Sherriff Daniel Bustamante, killed by the bandits infamous for performing the last great train robbery in the west. "
"WL01","01 general comments","WL","Wildlife  incl SSS","We appreciate that it appears SunZia chose to move the location where its power line will cross the Rio Grande River north after concerns about siting it in proximity to the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge were raised in 2015. These concerns centered on the fact that the River is a very important migratory corridor and Bosque del Apache is an important wintering ground for birds like Sandhill Cranes, geese, ducks, and raptors like hawks and eagles. The height of the lines guarantees that birds will collide with them insuring their deaths and potentially starting fires in the bosque forest as their remains plummet to the ground. "
"WL01","01 general comments","WL","Wildlife  incl SSS","   However, placing the line further north will still imperil  these migratory birds which also use other important bird areas along the Rio Grande such as the Bernardo Waterfowl Management Area and the Whitfield Wildlife Conservation area. The same concerns for wintering birds will apply. These birds fly daily to and from feeding and roosting grounds and will be risking their lives each time they do it in the proximity of the power line. Waterfowl and raptors are the largest birds that could be affected, but smaller birds are at risk also. North America has lost nearly 3 billion birds since the 1970's representing a third of the overall avian population. Every single negative impact cumulatively adds to this alarming decline. In addition to being a migratory corridor, in our warming world and age of persistent drought, the river offers a life line of water and riparian trees to birds and other wildlife. The riverine forest of Cottonwoods is extremely important for biodiversity in our arid state. The Middle Rio Grande riparian habitat hosts 270 species of birds with just about 1/3 of them breeding in the valley, over 60 species of mammals and 11 species of bats in addition to turtles, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. In our current age of mass extinction, we can no longer take the long term survival of these species for granted."

Tests increasingly show that a buildup of static electricity around power lines attracts particulates in the air and carries them to the area, where they accumulate. This problem is made worse if power lines are located close to other sources of pollution (like the many sources inherent to large-scale construction sites). Pollutants are often made up of a mixture of contaminants that can then become charged by the electricity running through the power lines.

Approximately 400 species of birds will migrate through, winter, or breed in the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) .. many flying thousands of miles to and from wintering and nesting areas in Canada, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Mexico. 

The Important Bird Area (IBA) program, coordinated in the U.S. by the National Audubon Society and in other parts of the world by Bird Life International, enables scientists to identify places essential to birds for breeding, wintering or migrating. New Mexico currently has 62 mAs, several of which are in the MRG including Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, Ladd S. Gordon Waterfowl Complex (composed of the Belen, Casa Colorada, Bernardo, and La Joya Waterfowl Areas), Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge and the Rio Grande Nature Center. 

During spring and fall migration, the shorelines, mudflats, and sandbars of the Rio Grande provide important feeding grounds for migrating shorebirds and waterbirds that need to refuel during their journey along the river corridor. The waters of the Rio Grande in this area also support valuable riparian forests and marshes which host breeding populations of many neotropical migrants such as warblers, tanagers, and flycatchers, and these same riparian habitats are critical migration stopovers for waterfowl and other species that breed farther north.

Along with the Rocky Mountain population cranes, the Middle Rio Grande Valley plays host to hundreds of thousands of migrating and wintering waterbirds and countless breeding and migratory neotropical migrants and raptors. While we are developing a better understanding of the potential dangers that high voltage transmission lines would pose to the Sandhill Cranes, we have little data or understanding of how the other 400 species of birds (bats and other wildlife) would be impacted by high voltage power lines bisecting this continentally important migratory corridor. It would be completely unscientific and unacceptable to assume that the impacts to 99% of the bird species that migrate through, winter, or breed in the MGR won't be impacted by SunZia's overhead transmission lines, nor would it be scientifically sound to make inferences on the impacts to a majority of these birds based on data collected on a few species. 

Without having sufficient data on the impacts that these overhead lines would have on a majority of birds and other wildlife that will encounter them, there is presently no way of accurately quantifying the overall impacts to wildlife or determining the true mitigation requirements for any of the overhead alternatives being proposed. It seems imperative to us that there be additional studies and data collected on a larger sample size of the avian population that will encounter, and could be impacted, by the overhead Sun Zia transmission lines at all three proposed alternative crossings. Assumptions with regard to other species simply can't be made based on data collected on Sandhill Cranes and the two endangered species. At the very least this sample size should include the ranges and movement patterns of bird species included on the Partners in Flight Species of Continental Importance, Intermountain West Priority Species, as well as all the bird species listed by the NMDG&F and USFWS as threatened or species of management concern in the MRG. 

It is important to recognize that in many areas detailed information is lacking, and that absence of information is not an indication of the absence of use or impacts to wildlife. Without more data on the potential impacts to more species of birds, bats and other wildlife, the only feasible alternative with regard to these proposed routes would be to bury the transmission lines under the Rio Grande and its historic floodplain. If the lines were buried at any of the proposed alternative routes, the impacts to wetland and riverine habitat would be minimal and quantifiable, the collision impacts to waterfowl and Sandhill Cranes would be eliminated, and it would be unnecessary to address the data gaps regarding the majority of bird species that utilize the MRG.

As stated in the Background Section, the overall SunZia transmission route right-of-way alone will 
consume an area larger than the city of Santa Fe, NM. The Riley/SRR Route right-of-way will 
consume ~3697 acres. The ~3697 acres under these transmission towers is mostly pristine land with 
many terrain changes. The difficulty in building in this terrain will be rife with issues, such as potential 
erosion, permanent damage to terrain and vegetation, and destruction and disruption of habitat to 
name a few. There will most likely be the need for temporary access roads during construction and 
possibility permanent roads for maintenance. Almost the whole Riley/SRR Route is through 
environmentally sensitive areas. Roads would create additional damage. Given the rough terrain as 
seen in Figure 5, which shows the elevation changes along the Riley/SRR Route, construction may be
difficult and especially prone to erosion. As depicted, many of these slopes are extremely steep. 
Machinery used to build these transmission lines would likely leave significant and permanent damage
along the route andpossibly off the route as well. Desert terrain is a very fragile environment. There are still trail ruts from 
wagons that used the Santa Fe trail over a century ago. 
Erosion would be a significant concern and ultimately the silt products from erosion could end up in 
the Rio Grande. The Rio Grande is already struggling with water levels and water flow and adding 
additional silt and soil material into the Rio Grande would be detrimental to this great river which is 
vital to New Mexico. Fourteen miles North of Magdalena and within five miles of the proposed 
Riley/SRR Route is where the C de Baca Uranium project was located.10 It could be that uranium or 
some other minerals could be exposed while digging foundations and disturbing the earth under these 
sites.

"PHS01","01 general comments","PHS","Public Health and Safety","Health and safety/hazardous materials
There is significant debate that living near transmission lines could cause health issues. While the 
exposure to High Voltage DC, plan to be carried by the SunZia Transmission project reduces some of 
the issues over High Voltage AC, it does not eliminate them. Additionally, in the public hearings SunZia
suggested that some of the additional capacity they may use could be High Voltage AC in the future. 
Therefore, advanced consideration should be given regarding the design of the power lines with that in
mind. The Environmental Protection Agency advises to limit one’s exposure to Electromagnetic Fields 
(EMF), stating they should increase the distance between yourself and the source and limit the time 
spent around the source.12 A precautionary approach should be taken and the towers should not be 
placed near residences or biologically rich areas. The Bureau of Land Management should consider 
setting electrical and magnetic field limits at the edges of the right of way as a condition of approval to 
protect the public.
High voltage power lines like these can induce currents in metal structures. Galvanized steel roofing 
material, fencing, water tanks, to name a few are items that could suffer from induced currents and 
could end up being electrified, which could be harmful.

"FIRE01","01 general comments","FIRE","Fire Management","Wildland fire ecology
High voltage transmission lines can be a significant impediment to fighting fires. There are significant 
power line hazards that are present to personnel fighting fires.13 The Santa Rita Ranches community 
does not have installed fire equipment. Wildland fires already present a risk in that area due to the lack
of water. This is a risk that the landowners accepted when purchasing their property, but this risk could
be significantly exacerbated by the presence of the transmission lines both by making it more difficult 
to fight fires in the presence of the transmission lines and also the possibility that the transmission 
lines could contribute to the possibility of a fire. Vegetation management and other measures can 
mitigate some of that risk, but of course eliminating vegetation is also environmentally detrimental, 
especially in desert landscapes. Transmission lines present in an area can make fires more prevalent 
due to weather related events, inadvertent contact with vegetation or other items , equipment failure, 
and possible conductor slap creating sparks in a dry environment. These are all valid concerns. There 
is increased risk to the lives and property of the people in the proximity of these transmission lines"
"WAT01","01 general comments","WAT","Water","Water resources
In their final state, the transmission lines would not be a big consumer of water resources or have a 
significant effect on the overall water situation in and around the transmission lines. There are a few 
potential exceptions to that however. Presumably anchoring towers to the ground, would require 
concrete, which requires water to mix. Given the scant amount of water in the area it would stand to 
reason that it will have to be trucked in, which of course creates significant road damage. Additionally, 
to mitigate dust during construction sites may have to be wetted down. The more significant concern 
would be that the large right of ways required under the transmission lines would create a natural path 
for erosion, especially if vegetation needs to be cleared for other reasons, as vegetation naturally 
reduces the effect of running water as it relates to erosion. The same concerns would exist with both 
temporary and permanent roads created by the project. The area by these power lines is cut through 
by arroyos and in the case of the Riley/SRR Route most of these end up in the Rio Salado and 
ultimately the Rio Grande. F"

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Corona generation and gap discharges from electric power transmission lines generate radio noise 
during their normal operation. These discharges can create EMI that can affect all types of electronics 
including cell phones, radios, and TVs. There are even studies that show the EMI can have 
detrimental health effects. Due to the remoteness of Riley(Santa Rita), it is already difficult to obtain a 
cell signal due to topographic effects, being on the fringe of coverage, and frankly being on the wrong 
side of geography from where cell phone providers earn their revenue, i.e. population centers. One of 
the most renowned radiotelescopes in the world, the Very Large Array is approximately 25 miles from 
this route. Radiotelescopes are extremely sensitive to EMI of all kinds.
EMI can affect nearby vegetation. EMI is a “noise” to radio signals. One might call it the invisible 
pollution of the radio spectrum.

The community of Santa Rita Ranches is extremely quiet. It is part of its attractiveness. When you are 
standing on a wind free day, it is extremely quiet. Due to corona discharge and other factors, power 
lines make noise. Weather events can even cause the transmission lines to make more noise. Noise 
is known to cause stress. Animals tend to be more sensitive to noise because many animals use their 
sense of hearing to find food, find each other, and avoid predators. Noise pollution in such an free

extremely visible. Corona discharges from power lines when igniting surrounding atmospheric gases 
can give off visible light. This is not a good thing in dark sky areas. Additionally, depending on Federal

lighting in such a dark location is detrimental to the character of the area."

All migratory birds are protected against direct take under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act

insect-eating birds are protected from take under New Mexico State Statutes (17-2-13 and 17-2-
14 NMSA), unless permitted by the applicable regulatory agency. To minimize the likelihood of 
adverse impacts to migratory bird nests, eggs or nestlings during transmission line construction 
activities, the Department recommends that ground disturbance and vegetation removal 
activities be conducted outside of the primary breeding season for migratory songbirds and 
raptors (1 March – 1 September). If ground disturbing and clearing activities during the breeding 
season cannot be avoided, the area should be surveyed for active nest sites (with birds or eggs 
present in the nesting territory), and when occupied, nest disturbance should be avoided until 
young have fledged. For active nests, adequate buffer zones should be established to minimize 
disturbance to nesting birds. Buffer distances should be ≥100 feet from songbird and raven 
nests, and 0.25 mile from raptor nests. For golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), ferruginous hawk
(Buteo regalis), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), a buffer zone of 0.5 mile should be established. Active nest sites in trees or shrubs that must be
removed should be mitigated by qualified biologists or wildlife rehabilitators. Department

three alternative sites SunZia is proposing for crossing the Rio Grande. Project planning should

mortality monitoring and adaptive management provisions. Line marker devices should be 
installed on the lines at potential collision hazard locations, and support towers should be lighted 
only where required by law, using red or red-and-white blinking or strobe lights. Towers should 
be erected without guy lines if possible; if a guyed design is necessary, the guy wires should be 
provided with line markers. In addition to line markers, a recent study using near-ultraviolet light 
reduced Sandhill Crane (Antigone canadensis) collisions with power lines by 98%1

However, we remain concerned about the impacts of other construction and maintenance activities; these concerns are amplified by the current proposal to expand the construction footprint beyond what was approved in the EIS, and make many miles of road permanent rather than temporary.
Roads are widely considered to be one of the major sources of habitat and watershed degradation, especially in semi-arid areas.

"MIT1","Mitigation (non resource specific","MIT","Mitigation (non resource specific","Offsetting unavoidable impacts: Overall, we find the mitigation offsets described in the original 2013 EIS and the 2016 ROW grant processes to be inadequate to adequately compensate for unavoidable impacts. The 2016 ROW, for example, only required offsets for a small number of acres in Designated Critical Habitat of federally listed Endangered Species. These handful of acres represent a tiny fraction of the acres that will be exposed to watershed disturbance and habitat degradation from construction and maintenance of this powerline and its associated infrastructure. Our 2015 letter to the Arizona Corporation Commission describes these un-mitigated impacts in detail. This amendment is an opportunity to evaluate a broader suite of potential mitigation measures, from avoidance to offsets. Specific to road impacts, adding permanent road miles and an expanded footprint to the right-of-way would cause additional ongoing impacts; this network should be examined for least-harm alternatives, and then considered in offset calculations. These impacts will be cumulative to impacts of the road network and construction footprint already described in the 2015 EIS. Because habitat/watershed degradation often has non-linear effects, the most robust approach for this amendment’s NEPA process would be to conduct an analysis of mitigation options for the full set of roads, construction disturbance, and other infrastructure – not just the most recent proposed changes."

The Middle Rio Grande Valley is a place of refugia for our human spirits to appreciate beautiful, natural landscape.

We cannot keep sacrificing our beautiful natural ecosystems, such as the Middle Rio Grande Valley, in the pursuit of an insatiable demand for more power by cities. And we also need to ensure the survival of our planet. Sun Zia has not committed to transmitting 100% renewable energy. The energy transmitted does not go to New Mexicans.

"PN04","Applicant PN","PN","Purpose and Need","5.) Include in the EIS all third-party studies related to the economic feasibility of the SunZia transmission proposal! Promotional hype by the applicant about cost- effectiveness and marketability can be very misleading to the public, investors, and regulators. It is not uncommon for a speculative project to fail after adverse environmental impacts have already occurred. Disclosure of actual third-party economic feasibility studies for long-distance tie-lines that purport to transport over 90% renewable energy must be included in the main body of the EIS before the next Record of Decision is considered. These highly relevant studies were buried in the public comment appendix of the last SunZia EIS, like many other bits of information, where they could conveniently be ignored by decision-makers and made difficult to find for the public.
