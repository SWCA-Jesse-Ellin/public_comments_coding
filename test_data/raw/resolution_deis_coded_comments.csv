What I -- the whole premise of the project and she kind of alluded to it also, is that somehow economics determines what they are allowed to do, and I don't understand that. In other words, they don't have to have that thousand-foot hole. The Forest Service is choosing to allow them to have that because it's more expensive to do it some other way. Why? I mean, I don't understand that. And the other thing is, I didn't realize they had the picture there, and they showed that after Year 6 it's going to start subsiding, as I understand it. Why don't just dump the stuff right back in the top? You know, it's the same stuff; right? It sinks down. You just keep putting out. You're all done. You don't have a hole. So that was two things.

I don't think we have very many sinkholes compared to what other places do. And if they went and cut and fill system like the way they had before, they wouldn't have this created at the old flats, some things would stay the same, and we wouldn't have any -- we wouldn't put our Apache Leap in jeopardy.

I feel that is wrong for Resolution Copper and the government to say that our culture and religion is wrong. We never did that to them. We picked out traditional foods there at Oak Flat. I spent time with my family and prayed at the holy lands in Oak Flat. This Is a place where we would go to for prayer and healing when we get sick.

However, economic effects from the mine would be most apparent in the environmental justice community of the Town of Superior due to its immediate proximity to Resolution Copper project operations. While mine-induced beneficial economic activity would be expected to increase in the region generally, the expected influx of new workers may also lead to shortages of area housing and/or pressures on municipal infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and medical facilities and may be accompanied by price increases. Such changes would be most likely to adversely affect low income and minority individuals in the Town of Superior and other environmental justice communities in the region.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","I appreciate that. These are actually federal guidelines that this project does not abide by.

The presiding judge wrote: The doctrine applies not only to Indian reservations, but also to other federal enclaves, such as national parks, forests, monuments, military bases, and wildlife preserves. We need to note the number of trees that they are planning to destroy by dewatering the region down to 7,000 feet and stop that action.

So now we're looking at this preferred alternative at Skunk Camp, but they haven't done the same level of geotechnical testing. They don't know if it's actually suitable or not.

I would note the last two dates were a Friday and Saturday, which are not exactly ideal times to announce the release of public documents. Back in June I had received an email from the Forest Service that specifically noted that hard copies or electronic would be available to anybody who requested them at that time. So I did request a hard copy in writing in June. I did not receive one at the time that the EIS release was announced. I waited a few days. I still didn't receive one. I sent an email to the public affairs specialist on the 19th, I believe it was, of August, and made kind of a stink about it. And the next day there was a copy dropped off at my doorstep. At that point, 10 days had elapsed. That's 10 percent of the comment period was gone before I was even provided with a copy of the document that I had requested two months previously. That's not good. [COMMENT CONTINUES LATER IN LETTER] We need to extend the comment period. Scoping began -- the scoping began on March 18th, 2016. The Draft EIS was officially made available on August 10th, 2019. That's a period of roughly three years and five months. I asked that the public be given the same amount of time to review and comment on this document that it took to prepare it.

And so all of us, from the project, all the way down to the Gila River, our wells are either in the wash or within a couple hundred feet of the wash, and our water level where we're at is 57 feet down, folks.

What I propose that would probably make us feel a lot whole better for us getting our water out of it is that they take and test -- have a well on somebody's property every mile to the Gila River. Now, this wash goes directly to the Gila River, about 11 miles south of this project. If they have one well every mile, have it checked four times a year by an independent lab to EPA specs, which are stronger than the state specs on water quality -- way stronger -- so if they would do that, that would probably make a whole bunch of us feel a whole lot more comfortable about this project."

And he said that according to their studies, that some of those peaks had risen 37 feet over a five-year period. Now, those peaks that he was talking about are within sight of this project. When you're up there, you can see the project site. And also, I get around that area a lot, and I know a lot of people up there. One of the old fellows that's 80-some years old that still goes to all the mines -- he walks every day, and he goes up to the mines, all the way almost up to that site, and he was telling me -- he's an old Spanish fellow -- and he was telling me that one of the mines he goes in up there, he says, ""Oh, I cannot go in there very far."" I said, ""Well, how come?"" His name's Chuy. I said, ""How come, Chuy?"" He said, ""Well, I go in there a little ways,"" he said, ""there's sulfur smoke coming out of the mine, coming out of there. It's a vent. It's a volcanic vent, and it gets a lot of sulphur gas coming up out of that vent."" And he says, ""I can't go in there."" He says, ""I'll die."" The main thing I'm bringing that up for is have any of these people at Resolution or some of you folks at Forest Service or whatever, has anybody taken into account the possibility of a seismic situation caused by volcanic action? Because if this old Spanish fellow has been around here for 50-some years, finds a fumarole vent in one of the mines up in that area, then who says there's not a possibility of something happening? In a situation like this with a dam face that's holding back that much waste, we can't afford the slightest bit of miscalculation, because I live downstream, and so do a lot of the people in this room live downstream. So maybe checking for -- you know, with vulcanologists and people like that who've had situations or studies, find out if there is a problem with this. Because I'm not so much against the project. I'm against the possibility of it failing, and there's a heck of a lot of difference, you know, and that's just what I wanted to bring up.

And the way they were going to extract the copper, they put acid in the ground where they dynamite -- dynamited at, and that water was supposed to run down to one of their ponds that they had with the acid that they put.

One cannot place a value on the creation of God, nor can one quantify or articulate human damage and the loss that will be suffered. On the spiritual level, it is unimaginable.

For me, when Wendsler had addressed our community about the water, the fight for the water, I heard him. He was the Peridot council at the time. That's my district. And I'm an artist, and what I brought to the table, I told him, is I can bring my art as a weapon, meaning not like as a gun to hold, not to be violent, but to awaken people, because you see with artwork, the impact of artwork. It brings many messages, even as the creator, as me, the artist, a young kid can interpret that, the things that I didn't see that I painted, and that's what Oak Flat has done for me. Spiritually, it has given me such an impact. Right now, in front of you is my flesh, my hair, but it's given me a much more insight of myself and that spirituality. Today in society, you see people who get outraged and curse and say mean things to even their kids, innocent kids. That's out of the flesh. But if you go deeper in that, it's spirituality. You learn to pray for patience, for wisdom, for the right words to say to your family, to your kids, even to yourself, because we could hate ourselves. But that's what Oak Flat has given me. I've marched for 44 miles off the reservation to Chi'Chil'Ba'Goteel. And like Wendsler said, his brother, a woman that I -- I carry now in my prayers the teachings that she has given to me, that he shares. I'm very grateful for that. It's to take everything with you. In a car you bypass that. Life is so fast. You bypass so many things in life. When you're walking with your two feet that's God's given us, you take the trash, you take the bad, you take the people who flip you off, you take all that, and it changes you, and you carry all that, and when you get there, and you make your destination, that's where the impact is, and that's what Oak Flat has given me, an insight on this community.

And in fact, if they agreed to do something that they weren't required to do, they could get sued by the mining company or their shareholders. And so, you know, I was talking to Jack McGregor from Carlota. He was -- they're all foreign. These are foreigners. They don't live here. They're gone, long gone, and we live here. And I asked him, ""Well, why don't you just fill the pit in?"" And he said, ""Well, it costs us another 12 cents a pound"" -- in those days it was about 72 cents a pound -- ""and they don't require us to do it, so why should we?""

That's where this -- these foreigners got their name, and it's just this bottomed-out moon skin, and they walked off and left it, and I'm sure for the same reason. They weren't required to do it.

Just recently with this DCP, Drought Contingency Plan, when we were going through this drought, they negotiated cutbacks to different entities, specifically states. Okay? The farmers were getting excess CAP water, but once there was not enough water in Lake Mead, that allowable water, the excess water, they started cutting back. Governor Ducey's going to propose to the Legislature that they set aside $30 million for extra drilling for the farmers, because there is no more excess CAP water. Okay? This is what Arizona's going to lose as a result of the Drought Contingency Plan. Their CAP allotment. Arizona's going to lose 192,000 acre-feet of water. Okay? That's out of their allocated 2.8 million acre-feet. Nevada will lose 8,000 acre-feet of water. Mexico will take -- will lose 41,000 acre-feet of water.

So it seems to me, that due to the geological structure at Top-of-the-World, the drop in water levels could be even greater in certain areas of our community.

"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","DEIS Appendix j, RC-211 states: ""A variety of potential actions are identified that could be used to replace water sources. These include the following: Drilling new wells applicable to both water supplies and GDEs,"" which means, ground water dependent ecosystems. ""The intent of installing a well for a GDE is to pump supplemental groundwater that can be used to augment the flow. The exact location and construction of the well would vary,"" end quote. This might be a potential action for places like Superior. But drilling a new well at Top-of-the-World would mean drilling into the water source that is being affected by the drawdown. Simply stated, it would not be a potential action that would meet the definition of mitigation, which is to make something less harsh or severe. Add to this the fact that most every resident at Top-of-the-World has water supplied by individual wells. How would water from a new well be delivered to each residence? DEIS Appendix J, RC-211 goes on to state: ""It is assumed in many cases groundwater would be transported to GDEs via an overland pipeline to minimize ground disturbance."" This refers to the delivery of water from any well -- any new well or wells. But it also suggests a solution to alleviate the impact of any groundwater draw down at Top-of-the-World. But before I put forth what I believe to be a viable solution, let me repeat the definition of mitigation. Mitigation means to make something less hash or severe. I do not believe that anyone whose water source was negatively impacted by Resolution's mining activity would only want the impact to be made less harsh or severe. It goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway, water is life. So Resolution's mining activities negatively impacts grounds water supplies at Top-of-the-World or anywhere else, the morally right solution is not replacing the groundwater drawdown through mitigation, making it less harsh or severe, instead the morally right solution is to replace the groundwater drawdown by restitution, which means the return of something to the condition it was before it was changed. My suggested solution. Again, DEIS Appendix J, RC-211 states: ""It is assumed in many cases groundwater would be transported to GDEs via an overland pipeline to minimize ground disturbance."" Then it goes on to say, ""Wells require maintenance and perpetuity and likely would be equipped with storage tanks and solar panels, depending on specific needs,"" end quote. As a reminder, new wells might be a solution for places like Superior and others, but not for Top-of-the-World. And since in perpetuity is the issue, then I suggest the viable solution for Top-of-the-World would be for Resolution to contract out the delivery of water to Top-of-the-World to a utility, such as Arizona Water, which has the expertise to do so and would solve the in perpetuity issue. Also, Resolution would be required to have the water delivery system to Top-of-the-World in place before any mining activity is allowed to begin that could impact our GDE. This would mean that every individual who gives permission, would have their residence connected to the system before any mining activity would be allowed to begin, that could impact the GDE. I believe this is the morally right thing to do and, as best as I can determine, would meet the definition of restitution, which again means the return of something to the condition it was before it was changed. Also should anyone at Top-of-the-World to need to utilize this water delivery system because the groundwater supplies at Top-of-the-World is impacted by groundwater drawdown, they should not have to pay for that service that in perpetuity. This is, again, a morality issue. It would be morally wrong to charge anyone for replacing what was taken away from them because of Resolution's mining activities. Restitution is the return of something to the condition it was before it was changed, should not come with a cost to the property owner."

DEIS, Appendix D, Section 5.1 refers to potential mitigation opportunities, such as the Queen Creek watershed, recharging the Gila River, et cetera. So I suggest that if restitution for Top-of-the-World is to have a utility company install a water delivery system, then at that the same time fire hydrants could be installed at strategic locations to mitigate to make less severe any potential damage from a wild fire in the area."

I wondered how this could possibly be happening to them, adding danger to Apache Leap, to Oak Flat, the canyons, the springs, the oak trees, the indigenous Apache artifacts, the burial sites, the animals and plants, and to my home... I started praying, and in my heart I was praying with the Apache people. I could see them standing with me in my mind's eye. We were dancing in prayer together. I soon went to a favorite place at Oak Flat that I've known since childhood. The Petroglyphs, where a hunting story is told on an overhanging cliff wall, shows all the different kinds of animals, insects and reptiles traveling in one direction, towards a spring really. I also remember a figure of a man with a drawn bow facing the direction from which the animals came, but unfortunately a hate crime was committed with a splash of blue paint over the hunter, but I still remember it well. While I was there, in the shadow of the cliff, thinking about what this copper mine wanted to do, I cried so hard, my tears fell on the rock that I rested against, so much that the rock became moist from my tears, I still cry when I think of the evil deed that wants Oak Flat. Not long after my trip to the Petroglyphs, I met Wendsler and his family and stressed my concerns to stand with them in protection of Oak Flat. Later, I met many more Apache families at my very first Sunrise Dance that I attended In Oak Flat. All the spiritual experiences that I've ever had at Oak Flat were validated that weekend. It truly Is a Holy Place, and I understood then, why and how. As my relationship grew with the Apaches, I found an extended family that I could really relate to once and for all ... In all about Creation, God, Spirit and how It works together through Nature and Heart and In knowing because all my life I have listened to feel and see what the land and the wind communicated with me since as a child while discovering this land that I was raised in. God works through all of this, and anyone can be blessed in this way If you Just appreciate and cherish the wonder of it all.

We used to hike up there, I'm the youngest in my family and the daredevil in my family and I always wanted to go cliff hanging out there. It was one of the things I liked to enjoy out there. I was taught growing up to enjoy the outdoors. And now I show them the same things I went through; tell them the places they can go and explore to enjoy the fun times I enjoyed. It was nice to show my kids and now they're passing that down. It's a place of peace where I can go and be connected to my spiritual family. It's always been a place of gathering for many other Native people in the area. It's a place where families get together and socialize, communicate, trade things, share things, share moments. I have a lot of good memories there. Over the years, it's changed a lot. I still go there, but I notice that more and more it goes on that my family is being limited to go to a place like that. My children get sad to know that they can't go to the place they know. Oak Flat is one of the places where my people, as Apaches, have always been and gathered. It's one of our mountains. To see it go through this process is very sad. "

My father was a copper miner. It is not a job he loved. It was a job that killed him. And money is not everything, as we know. Mr. Bosworth, I would like to read to you from John Muir, who was also known as the Father of National Parks. He is a man who wrote books. Well, he was a philosopher. He was a lover of the land. He was a lover of the earth. But I want to read a quote by him. ""Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature will heal and give strength to the body and soul alike."" The world that we're living in now is in dire need of soulful places. A place where a person can go and their heart is healed again. We live in a world where we're afraid to just even go down to the grocery store. To be in a crowd like this is a scary place now, and it's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. It's going to get worse, and I know that. And in reality, I think all of you know that, that safer places and good places are disappearing from this earth faster and faster and faster. You can't even go into a church and feel safety there anymore, because we're not safe in a church. So why in the world would we allow a foreign company to come into America and basically rape and kill our mother, the earth? It makes no sense. Now, I know and I understand that we all need a roof over our head. We all need cars to drive. We all need food on our tables. I understand that. But I also understand this. I understand that the earth is giving. I understand that there is a way to make money leaving people to peaceful places and soulful places, that there is a place and there is a job that people can have where instead of taking from the earth, we can give the earth back to people where they can find a peaceful place, where, like the gentleman said, where he loves to take his children to. You're going to take that from him. You are robbing his children of safety and love and peace. Going to ask you please, please just think about the earth. Thank you. "

It's an amoeba, an octopus, a shape-shifter, or whatever other metaphor you might want to use to describe something that simply can't be pinned down. It keeps changing. The idea of a single, all-encompassing EIS is asking for the impossible. Yes, I'm aware that this is what the legislation mandates, but that doesn't mean it's smart, reasonable or even realistic.

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","Well, first, you know, listening over and over and sitting at these meetings and hearing the destruction, I turned and I even told Neil Bosworth that this is premeditated murder on a sacred site, not only for my cultural -- the significance of my culture. The direct connection that we have to the land, to our God, to the creator, but for all these people from our neighboring towns, the water that's going to continue to give them life so that they can live, the plants, the animals. This is a complete destruction and murder on a land and environment and a continued genocide on my culture and my religion. I come from Oak Flat Chi'Chil'Ba'Goteel. I grew up there. I picked my acorns. I picked medicine with my grandmother. I raised my children there. I have three girls. One who had her coming of age ceremony. My youngest daughter had began her coming of age ceremony. When Oak Flat is destroyed, you are cutting my children's life in half. Remember that. Because in our way and our belief, this paints their (unintelligible) for the rest of their life, as human beings, not just as Apache people, but human beings who are placed on this earth. You are killing my children and those yet to be born. Someday my children are going to have children. I'm going to be a grandmother, and I'm going to be a great-grandmother, and my religion is going to die because Tonto National U.S. Forest Service and Resolution Copper is going to kill Oak Flat. Now, tell me how do I explain that to those yet to be born? How do I pass on oral history that was given to me from generation to generation from my grandmother, my grandfather, from my father and my ancestors before them? You can go to church. You can sit there and praise God. My church is sitting at Oak Flat. My church is at Chi'Chil'Ba'Goteel. That is my church. That is my way of life, and how can you disregard it? How can you say it does not exist? Just because you don't understand? Someone needs to make a moral decision. If you were in my place and having to tell my children that their way of life might not no longer exist, how are you going to handle it? So I ask you, open your mind. Open your heart, because we as indigenous people are not only protecting Oak Flat and our culture and our religion and our people, but we're protecting each and every one of you, all the different towns.

Something that we didn't really publicize. Something that we didn't look for in articles or really didn't get a chance to share with the world. We just shared with ourselves family time. I'm wanting to share two points, major points that the Oak Flats is a cultural landscape that will be negatively affected. It's a landscape. It's not just a metes and bounds measured property. It's not a little point on a map to us. It's unique because it's located between the Phoenix basin and the higher Sonoran desert scrub region. Twenty-one food and medicinal plants live there. Water live -- used to flow there around moss, as I remember collecting water coming down from the rocks. And, you know, that's -- my second point is our connection to the land will be directly affected. When I say ""our,"" my family being very traditional was taught that we respect the land. Anywhere we go, we give thanks. We collect water, give thanks and say prayers, not just for ourselves, but for everybody in this world, for Mother Earth.

It would be a disgrace of what America is doing to the people of this country. And this was the first one. And then those are -- those of you from Globe, Gosar tells us, Chairman Nosie, their goal is (unintelligible), because everything's going to drop. So you might as well get the reservation loaded with stores and everything, because now the valley people are going to come through our area and hit the same and go up towards the White Mountains. So you're going to be able to get all that opportunity of business. Globe (unintelligible) going to die. They're a dying town. Those were the things that they said. But you know what? Today the Apache people stand up for Superior, Globe and Miami. We stand up for these people, for your children, because to you, this is your home, just as almost as equal as us. So what's really sad tonight, Neil Bosworth, by what you just heard earlier, you're hearing what corporation versus the natural world, corporation versus community, corporation versus actual life, and if you're the one that's going to make that decision, it's a moral decision. You're going to live and die with that. So the best thing that you ought to do is turn that back over to the Congressional people, because there's two bills sitting there all ready to be heard. If the people of Arizona can give that support and support you in that, knowing that you have faith in our people, faith in this country, faith in a moral decision, they would drop it back where all the other ones started from. So there's no way you can lie to me in the way you lie to everybody else in this process with Resolution Copper. Everybody's being bought. Everybody is. I have high school friends in Globe who's come up to San Carlos to convince me, getting paid 100,000, 50,000. It's a bad deal. We walk through every day, through Oak Flats. During our walk, we have people whispering to us, ""We're with you, but we can't say that because this is a mining town. We can't say anything. We can't support you, but this is awful. We don't even want to buy any more property."" So all of those things are happening. Let's wake up and make the right decision. You have religious people behind you. Religious people.

And we know -- I mean, I don't know how many people know here how this all came to be. Resolution Copper made several attempts before this right, and Congressional leaders disagreed, that this was not to happen, but it wasn't until our own legislative leaders in the state of Arizona that pushed this land exchange, and giving no right to anybody, giving no right to the Native American people, of their religion, of how that was going to be addressed, and you know that -- or I know you don't know, if you do. But anyway, that's what took place, is that the Congressional act was done, and this is why we're all affected by this. Now, from day one of public hearings to this day, we see the big difference, because Globe and Miami and Superior began to wake up. They began to question what's in this deal. And now they're knowing that it's not right. It's not a good thing for this whole region, because our accountability and the way we would be self-sustaining is this water is left. Other than that, we're completely wiped out. And so I'm in town all the time talking to my friends. I went to school. And all over, they're upset, because they didn't know this was going on. So for these -- those of you out here, I went to the Miami mayor, Globe mayor, Superior mayor, Apache Junction, all these places. Nobody had the plan of operation. When we came here -- the chairman of our tribe came here to meet with Globe. The city council turned to the mayor and said, ""Hey, all they want is the plan of operation. Give it to them, because they didn't get it."" Well, come to find out the Globe council never had it. The mayor never had it. None of these leaders that we have seen any plan of operation. It was just moved forward with all the good talk about moneys coming in. People are getting money are bought off. They're the one that can suppress their own people and their own towns, just like we are. Some people got hired to suppress our own people. This is an ugly, ugly deal, Mr. Bosworth, and you know it. So if anything that you can hang onto to open a door is the religion, because you know for a fact you haven't even covered that, and it's -- it's an insult to see this. In only two parts it talks about Apache. Two parts. And yet kids, kids crying to you tonight. So you don't -- I don't know about you, but for us is that when we leave this earth is where God gives the blessing, because what is in here is going to be opened up for what we have done in the world. Now, I don't know if you've gotten any money first before that. That's going to be a choice you're going to have to make, but all we can do here is pray. That's all we can do. That's all we got left.

But that doesn't stop me from growing up there and imagining Apaches standing on the mountain. I can see them in my mind's eye. I knew they were there first. I could see the remnants of everything they did there. I've been going to Oak Flat all my life. I remember the petroglyphs there and there used to be -- it's all -- all these animals walking to one direction. Some of them look like even pre-historic animals. And I remember there was one -- a man with a bow facing the opposite direction where the animals were walking. Somebody has desecrated that, but I remember it very, very well. I talked to Ann Kirkpatrick once about that. I said, ""What about all that history, all that's there that would be destroyed?"" And she looked at me really kind of just blankly and she says, with this weird kind of smile, ""Well, we'll just have to find a way to move it."" You know, it's -- a lot of people go through life and they just don't get it. They don't see. They don't feel.

I've seen their tracks and I've seen how the water has been depleted. And just real quick I want to say that last night I woke up in the middle of the night and turned on the TV and ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" was on. And I thought to myself, my God, when are we going to stop? When are we going to finally respect the people that were here first and stop taking away from them? When is that going to happen? It was a profound moment for me for that to be on right at that time last night and I recorded it. And everyone needs to think about that.

It's going to break my grandparent's heart. It's going to break my mom's heart. I'll be there with my grandparent, Wendsler, to stand with him. It doesn't matter.

A couple of the references that you might want to look at, if you want to see his involvement with Nature Conservancy, is just go to the Nature Conservancy Arizona website and you'll find him listed there as one of the members of the Board of Directors. And in other places you can find there, he's been a member of the Board of Directors since about 1988. I'm certain that Steven Carothers is an excellent environmental scientist. There's no question about this and I'm not questioning the qualifications of any of the people doing this. Unfortunately, this contract was awarded as what they call a general services account, a contract, a schedule. Where you go on and post all of this information about your company with your rates and so forth and if anybody in the government wants to buy that thing that you sell, they can go on and say, well, let me go buy a contract or award a contract to these guys. And that's what happened is that SWCA got a contract from the U.S. Department of Agricultural. Some contracting officer made the buy. He didn't know that Steven Carothers was heavily involved in the 7B Ranch. He didn't know about those kinds of conflicts of interest. They weren't in front of him. However, I'm calling it to everybody's attention, the Forest Service and SWCA tonight that this needs to be resolved. You can't have the wolf guarding the henhouse. Either SWCA needs to go out or the 7B Ranch has to go out. They can't co-exist in this deal at the same time, in my opinion. And my opinion is based upon decades of understanding the Federal Acquisition Regulations. So I hope that everybody understands that I'm not picking fights with anybody. Everybody here is very honorable. But you now have a piece of information that you didn't have before and you are required to act on it. And I would suggest that everybody here contact the U.S. Department of Agricultural's Inspector General in the morning and inform them of this. "

They destroyed the crosses, but we put new ones there. l sing songs about Oak Flat. I keep singing the songs from the old people about Oak Flat. The mine would take over and I don't like it.

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive"," I'm writing this statement to stop the process of the desecration of sacred oak flat. Oak flat has a special connection with me and my family within our culture, identity and our way of life. For the Apache people oak flat has always been a sacred and holy place for prayer, traditional ceremonies, specific medicines, animals and water. We know this from the songs, teaching of the elders and prayers that sacred Oak Flat is there and has been there since the beginning. The instant you see Oak Flat you are remember but the songs, and teachings that it is there and you feel the holy connection with it. Setting foot on there you know you belong. Even to my people (Un'k Akimel O'odham) Oak Flat is a sacred holy place. It is mentioned in our traditional songs that my ancestors would meet and pray there because of the direct connection to the holy spirit Juhwertamahkai (earth doctor). Oak Flat also has a great and holy connection with my family, and I because in June of 2019, we administered an Apache Sunrise ceremony for my oldest daughter. The sunrise ceremony is a special coming of age or entering of womanhood for a young girl that has been passed down from the ancestors. My daughters Massage (pre-ceremony before the sunrise ceremony) was held at Oak Flat because she feels the connection in her heart and soul. In preparation for the ceremony we gathered Yucca plant sticks and greens from oak trees to help set up a camp site. When my daughter was the Sunrise girl she used the greens from the oak trees and yucca to make her own house called a Wikiup. My daughters wikiup (house) still stands as of today. That's her home and will always be her home but not if it is destroyed. I have two other daughters that plan to have their ceremony there as well but if the mining takes over there will be nothing for them. No water, trees, animals or way of life. The desecration of Oak Flat will be a painful and morally reminder of the centuries of physical and spiritual violence that all Native Americans have endured at the hands of European invaders. Don't not take Oak Flat from us. Save our home. Oak Flat is home to the people who have always known what is truly sacred and holy in this world. "
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","The most devastating impacts of the Resolution Copper Project are the ones that are not easy to state objectively. These are its impacts regarding the basic human spiritual need for natural, wild, and sacred places. This need may come from the tens of thousands of years that our ancestors lived in and adjusted to a world unaffected by human intrusion, and where almost all of the life in that world was adapted to natural conditions. That contrasts with only hundreds or a few thousand years that humanity recently spent accommodating to the crowded, artificial, toxic surroundings of modern civilization. During my one and only visit to Oak Flat I experienced a spiritual feeling that's difficult to describe in a few words. It was not during any of the Apache Stronghold gatherings, or Apache religious ceremonies. There were only one or two occupied camp sites. A few silent wikiups served as reminders and gave tribute to the special people to whom this land is sacred, and whose ancestors were here long before me. Although Oak Flat is not a designated wilderness area, it provides many of the miracles of nature that are treasured In wilderness: an opportunity to experience solitude, absence of big-city bedlam; habitat for animals, and the natural beauty of surroundings that exist in a form as intended by the Creator. It is impossible to put an objective value on the miracles of nature. So we often use a single endangered species to near the entire burden of protecting a vast natural area. At Oak Flat it is the Indigenous Americans who have taken upon themselves much of the burden to protect a space that has a special sacred meaning to them. All land should be sacred to all people, and therefore treated with love and respect. The Resolution Copper Project would sacrifice another of the natural, wild, sacred places needed by all humanity, and needed by all wild creatures, at a time when there is a growing scarcity of such places. This is also a time when many of the voting public favor preservation of such places for the benefit of future generations. "

If the Resolution Copper mine continues on with destroying Oak Flat, then I will never have a sacred place to come back to or to show my kids where our ancestors gathered. I have many memories of Oak Flat of our family when we would sing out traditional songs. Our elders would tell us the history of Oak Flat. Please stop destroying our place that Is sacred to each and every one of us. You'll be taking away a part of me because I love Oak Flat so much. Being at Oak Flat gives me strength and during my ceremony I danced through 3 days, and It was hot, but I made It through by praying so that I'm strong during the ceremony. By praying I felt the presence of my Uncle Paul and my great grandma which Is what gave me strength. My Uncle from California was sick and he heard about Oak Flat and how it was a holy and strong place. He came and he said being there he felt better and stronger, although he was very ill. If Oak Flat is gone then my future kids will never get to experience what I've felt before the presence of our ancestors and our sacred place. Our prayers are at Oak Flat along with our hearts. My house that I built still stands and every chance that I get I try to visit It which makes me happy to know that I can come back when I need to.

We used to go visit my grandparents and we'd stop at Oak Flat. My father used to walk around and get glue, he'd be chewing it and say he made some Indian gum. He used to go up over the mountain with my mom and she would collect acorn. And we were always stopping by over there. There are so many acorn trees. My Aunt Marie, she would go there and pick acorns. Out there she would smash them on the rocks and put them in a blanket. She'd shake it and then blow the hard ones away. She would grind it on a wheel and then we'd take it home and make acorn soup. My mom used to pick the berries - in Indian it's called. Everyone called it Kool Aid. At that time everybody talked Apache. So that's what I know to call those berries. She would make that for us at home. I don't see people make that as much anymore. But Oak Flat is where she used to get it. My grandma would come with us sometimes. At the time everyone wore a camp dress. And everyone talked Apache. And then we moved to San Carlos and the government came in and it was like a boarding school. When we went to school, we're not supposed to talk Apache. Anybody talk Apache, the government teacher would put them against the wall and slap their hands. And we would sit there and one time the teacher beat up a boy, slapped him around. They would line us up for a checkup, check our hair without our parents. They gave us shots but we didn't know what kind of shots they were giving us. They would take us to the shower and they made us undress before we took our shower. Our mother never knew. That's how things were at the beginning of my life.

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","To Whom It May Concern: I first heard about Oak flat, Arizona and the midnight rider on the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act in December of 2014. Although Arizona Congressional Representatives had tried several times without success in authorizing a land swap through US Congress, this sneaky rider on a must-pass bill permitted a sale of land to Australian mining company Rio Tinto in exchange for land in other areas throughout the state. This land now known as Oak Flat has traditionally been used by various indigenous Peoples, among them the Chiricahua Apaches, some of whom we have befriended. Our new friends have shared with us some of their history and cultural practices, and we have joined them in ceremony and delicious meals prepared from thee foods gathered from the area. My husband and I treasure these gatherings and have a newfound respect for the traditional practices our friends have shared with us. We find our souls restored as we camp at Oak Flat, walk and hike the area, visit the petroglyphs and natural springs lo pay our respects, and engage in communal prayer with the Indigenous people of this land and their allies. My husband is a 20 year veteran of the USAF, Ret. MSgt., and has a number of veteran friends who have found very valuable healing time spent at Oak Flat. Many of these friends have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and great anxiety, which they report is lessened during and after time spent at Oak Flat. I understand Oak Flat also offers world class climbing area, and every time we have camped at Oak Flat, we have met other hikers, climbers, and others who treasure the Oak Flat area and are distraught when learning about plans for the mine to cause a giant pit in its wake. My husband and I travel almost 900 miles to visit our friends and pay respect to the land and waters of the Oak Flat area at least once a year, ad we are devastated to think this special area may be destroyed for a foreign mining company to profit off the “resources” of this land, when the natural rocks, springs, plants, animals, birds, and ecosystems, and cultural and spiritual history and practices are the real value for us. I urge you to do everything in your power to protect Oak Flat, as it is irreplaceable. "

We the people that are from generation to generation, stand together and come together in unity and believe together that mining companies around the world just stop and think twice before destroying Mother Earth because mining companies leave our Mother earth destroyed. We the people that live on Mother Earth take care of Mother Earth, the rain from the sky, the sacred plants. The sacred plants, the medicine plants, the plants that we eat, the animals the bears, horses, cows, deers, rabbits and all sorts of other animals live on Mother Earth. We have a place to live.

Every year when I come to Oak Flats it brings tears to my eyes that my ancestors from generations before have taught families and relatives to go out and retrieve medicine plants. There are animals that live on Oak Flats and have a place to live, sleep, eat food, and drink water. Oak Flats is sacred to us human beings and to animals that live on Oak Flats. In my belief and I say Oak Flat should just stay clean. I have respect for Oak Flats. The secret land of Mother Earth. This mining company that is coming here to our sacred lands should just stop and realize what they're doing and think twice of what they're going to do to Mother Earth. They should turn around and head back to their country and do mining there in their own country, in their own land, and I pray that the mining company should realize of what they're doing to other lands around the world.

And through personification draws the female participant closer to the first woman, known as Esdzanadehe ('Mlite Painted Woman/Changing Woman). The ceremony itself contains much dancing, singing, rituals, and history. During the ceremony the girls power is for herself though In the four holy days following the ceremony, It becomes available to anyone. Besides from the ceremony oak flat Is where we still keep our traditions alive by gathering our acorns, medicinal plants, honor our ancestors buried there. We've never lost our relationship to chi'chll Bildagoteel /oak flat. Though the U.S. Government at times in our history, has Imprisoned us on the reservations, and not allowed us to come here. We've established an encampment to protect the holy site at chi'chil Bildagoteel with its four crosses representing the four sacred directions north, south, east, and west. Including its water, animals, oak trees, and other plants central to our tribal identity. The four crosses are now part of the body of Chi'chil Bildagoteel. I ask you to please stand with the San Carlos Apaches and the other tribes who Oak Flat is important to and not allow the mining at oak flat to take place. The way we see oak flat is how people see the Vatican, western wall, Notre Dame cathedral and other sacred sites to other religions. Our land was our church, it's where we pray, and worship. "
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","But my principal comment is around the mining method that, you know, you're not looking at any other method than block cave and my experience in the business is there that there's been several open stope type mining methods used with a -- what do they call them -- in-place leach system. Typically this ore at this mine is a primary sulfide and you don't use that. It usually doesn't work on the leaching. But the conditions in this mine are very high temperatures, 170, 175 Fahrenheit, so a thermophilic bacteria leach is actually possible and it's been proven at a very large pilot plant scale test work for this type of material. So, with that in mind, there's a couple of in-place leach methods that might be examined in the future and it looks like there's plenty of time to do that, since it's approximately ten years away from production. And some of these early tests would only take a few months to conduct. Plus there's already some actual data out there on the ore that was similar to this that's it's been done on and it's worked successfully. "
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","There's a lot less water usage with leach methods, since, say, you're looking at probably the lower end of their example, 180,000 acre feet. Of course, disturbance, there would be no surface disturbance with an open stope mine because usually in-place means most of the ore is left behind. Some of it is taken out just to improve the permeability of the material left in the stope for leaching. So that would have to be treated at the surface. It's usually only 10 to 20% of the ore. So a much smaller tailings facility. Of course, any of the potentially acid generated material in the tailings would be much less. You would have much less acid generation metals to deal with in the future treatment of those facilities. I'm looking at the magnitude of the capital cost for this mine. I would gather you would use much lower capital costs. Leaching systems are typically lower cost to build than the concentrators and, of course, you would have much a smaller mining operations since you would only be extracting perhaps 10 to 15%."

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","Oak Flat has come to mean a great deal to me personally and spiritually, ever since I relocated to Arizona, leaving me gratefully committed to expressing the spiritual and sacred nature of this place and its importance to me. Prior to relocating to Arizona to assist my aging father, I was introduced by a friend to someone who was from San Carlos and for whom San Carlos was very religiously important. She told me that I should come visit Oak Flat sometime, that it's a very healing place, and to let them know when I was coming so that they could welcome me. Shortly after arriving to my new home in Sedona, I heard from the friend that there was a gathering and ceremony at Oak Flat coming up and that I should join them. I generally only visit places considered sacred once I'm invited and when it feels right. My personal relocation preceding this had been a big deal to me and other personal life experiences difficult and painful, so I was spiritually in a challenging time. I prayed on whether it was right for me to go to this sacred place at this time and, as a result, I accepted the invitation. My first visit to Oak Flat, I was met with some of the most beautiful, welcoming, openhearted, and good people I've ever met in my life. It was one of those rare occasions where I felt that I was among family, somehow, with a familiarity and ease and relaxed companionship that I've rarely felt with people I've just met in person. I felt honored, humbled, and touched to be included in traditional religious ceremonies, and to eat food prepared traditionally with acorns gathered locally. There is no doubt that this place and particular sites near the Oak Flat Campground hold great spiritual importance to the N'de (Apache) people and that it is a sacred place in the greater sense, holding spiritual presence and access to the spirit world, as I understand and experience it myself. Those of the Christian faiths might compare that sense and understanding to important life ceremonial experiences in places like church or a cathedral, or, even more so, to known sacred places like Jerusalem. These are the places where people make important spiritual life transitions, such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, and where people go seeking spiritual guidance during our most challenging times in life. I have few places like this where I turn for spiritual guidance, in prayer, and Oak Flat has become one of those places where I trust my prayers are heard and where I will receive guidance. Like anyone with deeply spiritual experiences, I do have my own that are connected to the Oak Flat area. I had received my own spiritual indications about this place, and it was a place referenced to me by a N’de very special to me years before – not by name but by importance and general geographical location and visuals. For these reasons, I hesitated in reverence before even accepting an invitation to visit. Once I was there, I felt that I already knew the place somehow, as well as the people I hadn't met yet. Being able to participate in ceremonies I was Invited to over the last couple of years meant a lot to me for a lot of personal reasons. This place and the experiences have given me what feels like the right way and place to pray about important matters in my own life, for people I love, for the world,and for all sacred places everywhere. This is the land and the place where these ceremonies were born, where the people from this land and with this religion know how to speak to the spiritual powers that exist. I always have felt that I need to speak to Spirit outdoors, amongst trees or water, the open sky, wherever I am. In this place, on this land, with and for the people who originate from this land, Chi'chil Bildagoteel (Oak Flat) Is the holy land, the sacred place, where prayers are heard and carried powerfully. It's a place that I and many I've met there feel that we were ""called"" to spiritually, through dreams, visions, spiritual experiences that overwhelm you and open your heart and life. This Is where I, like many others, have received much-needed healing, and where I have joined with others in ceremony to pray for much-needed healing for others and for good in the world. I'm humbly aware that I'm one person out of countless others who know this place as a very important and sacred place and who feel it absolutely crucial that it be protected and preserved, as a place in and of Itself, and for all the N'de whose traditional lives are centered there, as well as us newcomers. I think, with great emotion, of the children with their families whom I've camped with, been in ceremonies and on spiritual walks with, and, as I think of stories of the generations of people before who've been in those same ceremonies, and who've visited that land, and the small children today who are carrying that on for future generations to come. This sacred place, the trees, water, land below and sky above, the life they all support, must be preserved as they are and allowed to heal from past intrusions and disruptions. These young people and the rest of us who know this place need Chi' chil Bildagoteel (Oak Flat) to remain protected. It must be preserved for religious and ceremonial purposes and for future generations. I'm humbled and grateful to be able to share this testimony toward protection of Chi' chil Bildagoteel. "

This is Lizeth. And this is Soliel, and I have a son outside. His name is Felipe. And I would like to express that traditionally this is the ancestral homeland of the Apache people and that's not accounted for in this EIS. So just the history of the land, our people are from here, and we've also always cared for this area. And it wasn't until the 1880s when our people were rounded up and imprisoned on the San Carlos Apache Reservation. And during that time is when mining began in this area. Now, there's a whole lot of injustice we can talk about and the genocide. But in my little two minutes here, I want to express how important this area is for me and for my children. We go to Oak Flat all the time. My children run and they play there. My son, he's standing outside and he told me not to let you guys know that he has forts out there, because he thinks that you guys are going to try to destroy them. And every time we go to Oak Flat, the first thing he does is he jumps out of the car and he says, ""I've got to go check my forts and make sure they're not destroyed."" And as a mother that hurts. It really hurts, because he already knows. He knows by the conversations that we've had that, you know, something or someone, there's people out there that want to take away his homeland. My daughter here, she's nine years old and she already tells me that she wants her womanhood ceremony at Oak Flat. So, you know, that's a -- when she becomes a woman, will we even have that option? Will the land still be there? There's going to be a big crater there. And for history, for our -- my family, for generations to come, how will we tell the story of Oak Flat, if it's not there? It's a blatant attack on our religion, on our spirituality, on our culture, on our traditions and who we are as a people. Not only that, I mean, the land and the water, the contamination. I work in the health field, so if there's any jobs coming, it's going to be for doctors and those people that have to care for the people that are going to be sick from the contamination of this mine. I do want to express that, you know, this is going to affect my community for generations to come and if you live in this area, it's going to affect your generations to come too.

"3.14.02","Tribal Values and Concerns: Religion/Sacred Places","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns","Oak Flat and the surrounding areas were once Indigenous land, but as mineral resources were discovered the Indigenous people were pushed further and further east off of what was once their home and territory. What does that mean? It means that they once lived, hunted, gathered, struggled and practiced their religion on these lands. And as they died they were buried on these lands. Knowing these things makes this land sacred. Are Christian churches, Jewish temples and Islamic mosques not considered sacred places? And yet these structures (places of worship) are fairly new when you consider how long the Indigenous have been here practicing their religion. For the Indigenous, and in this case the Apache, who have been here for centuries before the arrival of foreigners, it is ignorance on our part to think that their religion, ancestors and land are not worthy of ""sacredness"" just because they don't occupy a physical structure. When you visit Oak Flat and sit still you can feel calm and serenity as you experience the beauty and solitude. There is where I find an inner peace that I don't even experience when I go to church on Sunday. It is truly a special place that should not and must not be destroyed just because it doesn't have a physical structure that houses a specific religion so that it can be called ""sacred"" Who are we to question the Apache people when they call it ""sacred""? After all, they practiced their religion and honored their dead in that place that we, the non-indigenous, call Oak Flat, Devils (GAAN) Canyon & Apache Leap. Knowing all that, I would say that this complies with what is considered ""sacred"" in every way."

I hereby affirm that I am providing my personal testimony as my public comment regarding the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and the Southeastern Arizona Land Exchange under my own free will and consent. Signature: Witness: Signed and witnessed on this 15th day of September, 2019. I am 17 years old and have been to Oak Flat many times for ceremony, runs and social events. The reason why Oak Flat is so Important to me Is because I have a very strong connection with the land. Oak Flat gives me connection with my family and my past ancestors. A place for me to dance with people that I love Including my closest cousin and my sister who had their Sunrise Dances there which I was able to be a big part of .. Because of all the dances I have done there it became my home. Whenever I am there the nature around me makes me feel free and I am able to rethink past mistakes and also the land makes me think of the future and how I can make my life better. With all the dances I was able to learn more about my culture and things I am supposed to do as a person and when I get older I know what I can pass on to the next generation. During the Oak Flat march/run I am able to run to protect the Oak Flat land and even though It Is dangerous while I am running with the cars passing by I feel safe when I run with the staff, like nothing can hurt me. During the Sun Rise dances I am able to lead a camp and with that role it shows how much I care about Oak Flat. As I lead a group down to the dance grounds I guide the prayers for the protection and wellbeing of the girls in the ceremony. The land Is reminds me of these times when I helped and worked with my sister and my closest cousin In their ceremony of becoming a woman. And If It was not for Oak Flat I would never have those experiences or memories in my life. It's a place for me to go back and remember these things I have done and all the prayers and emotions that I have given to my ancestors and my culture. In knowing that Oak Flat was not there I would feel like my heart had been tampered with because of all my connections and emotions I have created. I would never be able to go back. With all the dances I have made my mark on the land with the ancestors and created a new memory, I want to be able to show my kids what It means to be a part of the Spirituality at Oak Flat. In my feelings right now. I am unable to speak of how I would feel from the damage done and what It would do to my family and my life. It could never be healed because Oak Flat is a part of me and without It, the loss would be profound."

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive"," Oak Flat has been part of my family as far as I can remember. My grandma Brenda Dewey raised me since I was a toddler. When I could walk my grandma would take my cousins and I with her to Oak Flat along with her older sisters to pick acorn, gather berries for Apache Kool-aid, and medicine plants for ceremony and home use. When we would pick these plants and berries we would always pray and my grandma and her sisters would sing Apache Songs while picking and gathering. My grandma Brenda passed away from cancer caused by a company contaminating the water where my grandma and great grandma use to wash clothes and bath. Not only do I have memories of my grandmother at Oak Flat but lrie's dad Johnny P. Cassadore Sr. and I have made memories for our daughter Irie at Oak Flat. As parents we have taken Irie to Oak Flat for scared becoming of age ceremonies where we danced with her and prayed to Usen (God) and took her to the Holy Ground where her dad helps the medicine man sing Holy Songs for ceremony. If Resolution Copper should proceed with the land transfer it would affect my life and my daughters' life because Oak Flat will be destroyed the land and water contaminated. My daughter will not be able to safely walk where her grandmother and great grandmother had walked, picked berries, gathered medicine plants, sang apache songs and prayed due to the land being destroyed and contaminated. Also our memories and stories about praying there and her dad singing ceremony songs would be as though it didn't exist. Irie will always feel a void in her life because it is also where she first touched the earth at 4 months old. When Irie first touched the earth she was praying at the Holy Ground where she was blessed by Oak Flat and because of her pure soul she blessed Oak Flat too. As parents Johnny and I plan to have our daughters scared becoming of age ceremony at Oak Flat where she first touched the earth, first prayed to Usen (God), and first heard her dad sing ceremony songs. Without Oak Flat her life will always have an emptiness."
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","You know, I brought some papers to read and I wrote some notes on my phone but I'll skip all that. But it took 12 attempts by Resolution Copper to get the Senate and the Congress members to try to pass a bill. But it was in December of 2014 that they passed a National -- through the National Defense Act, they put a rider on that bill and they finally passed that land exchange. And that's what we're fighting for. And, Neil, you know, I pray for you. I pray for you when I go to sleep at night. I pray for you when I rise in the morning. I pray for you when I go to Oak Flat. I pray that Creator will touch your heart and let you understand and know that the decision you make will have an impact throughout our country, especially to the indigenous people. And I hope you do the right thing, I really do. I don't hate you. I don't dislike you. I just dislike what the federal government is doing to us. But you're a branch of the federal government. You're an arm of the federal government and I know you can do the right thing. I believe in you. And I trust that you will. And that's our -- our hope and our faith come from our Creator God to touch your heart, give you that compassion, that peace and sense of understanding to know where we come from. It's just not right what they did and we need to let Congress know they need to rescind their decision. They need to rescind their decision. There should have been a lot more done than what's happening now. Now we're just playing catch-up after the fact. ATF, you should know what that means, that's a federal term ""after the fact,"" all these things come in. And now people are seeing the truth. They're coming out, all these backroom deals that have been made, the millions and millions of money Resolution Copper has spent lobbying, paying people out, even some of our own Native people, which is just not right. They have no soul. They have no morals. They don't understand. All they want is just money, money, money. That's it, all for greed, power and lust. And I leave that with you. I hope that you do the right thing and I hope that my words are not wasted here today or none of our words. Thank you. (Speaking Native language.)"
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive"," I live in Queen Valley here in the Valley. I think I'm the first one to speak in the Valley. Anyway, I moved here about four years ago and then we found out we're going to have -- try to have the mining operation just above the dam over here where all the tailings are trying to be put. And we have a beautiful situation here in Queen Valley, with a lot of residents, and I think there's a few of us here. Who is here from Queen Valley? Yay. We have a beautiful golf course. We retired -- most of us are retired here. It's a beautiful scenery. It's a nice place to live. And, you know, I feel for Oak Flats, I really do. But I also feel for Queen Valley. And we do have an alternative that's been presented. And I think that the Forest Department is doing good job trying to find that alternative. And I've been speaking with some people today and they said that there's a possible chance that Skunk -- is it Skunk Camp -- will be an alternative location. I don't know if that's going to be a good location, but it's not the location above our dam here in Queen Valley. And people can be effected no matter where this is going to be put and I think if it has to be put somewhere we just have to decide what the best place can be for it if it has to be by law. And so I think the Forest Department is doing a good job on trying to find out where the least impact will be and they've got one going. Now, also, I would like to say that the water quality issue is a big issue. And that as a golf member here, I'm assuming that I own a chunk of it, and that I also own a chunk of the water rights that are with this golf course. So we're concerned about the quality of water, if they do put it behind this dam over here of ours and, you know, we need to protect that situation and have it checked out thoroughly and make sure that that water quality is kept because we have rights to that water and we don't want a huge company overriding those rights by contaminating our water supplies, whether it be drinking water or agricultural water. So I want to thank you for your time and for listening and I would love for some other people to get up here and talk."

That is just not right. We need to (unintelligible) BHP. They are murderers. They are murderers. They've already killed so many people causing cancer and they are going to continue to kill and kill and kill. To build a project that the federal government -- to terminate the Native American people, the indigenous people of this country. We were persecuted and murdered and killed just because we were here first. And that's a hate crime. But that's perjurious. That's racism. How do you think we feel? How do you think we feel as Apaches? Our heart hurts. You're hurting us. You're hurting us. The federal government has taken from us time and time again. They've cut our reservation six times. How much more are they going to take from us? I'm worried about my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren that are going to be here. My granddaughter had a ceremony at Oak Flat and I have dreams there when we went back to San Carlos to (unintelligible), that the mountain people that live there, are the mountain people, the spirit dancers. (Speaking Native language), that's Devil's Canyon. That's what the white people named that. But as Apache, as Apache mountain spirit dancers, but it's the white people that gave it that name Devil's Canyon, which it's not a devil's canyon -- they were religious people that they thought we prayed to whatever we did. But that's our church. That's our way of life. Chi™chil Bildagoteel is Oak Flat. They need to honor (unintelligible) mountain right here.

We were not -- we didn't come here by anything. We are from here. And you are murdering us. Rio Tinto is nothing but a murderer. And I will be standing right by Wendsler at Oak Flat where my ancestors are buried. And I'll be in my traditional attire when the bulldozer comes. If that's the way I go, that's my destiny.

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","Well, I'm kind of emotional because that's my older sister that just talked. And I look at my little niece and I look at my little nephew and it really tears my heart apart, because I'm a mother of three girls. And my -- all three of my girls were able to have their coming of age ceremony. And where my oldest daughter chose was Mount Graham, (speaking Native language), which is outside of Safford and we were relocated and put on the San Carlos Reservation from our sacred land over there. And then my middle daughter had her coming of age ceremony at Oak Flat. And then my youngest daughter, she felt the need to conduct it at both. She started the beginning process of her woman -- of her coming of age ceremony at Oak Flat and then finished it off at Mount Graham. So it hurts me to see my sister worried if she's going to be able to give a life for her daughter culturally. In the presentation it said we are -- this lady over here said we need to talk about the impacts of the DEIS. Well, when you talk about environmental injustice, when you talk about the environmental impacts, that is an impact on my culture. That is an impact on my religion. Because without the natural resources, without the water, without the medicine, the medicinal plants, the stuff that we use in these ceremonies is going to be gone. So that means that my daughters' lives are going to be severed in half. When you have a coming of age ceremony, that paves a life from the creation stories on how we exist to when they become an old woman and they go back up to the Creator. Now what happens to my daughter? Her life is going to be cut in half if Resolution Copper goes through? You know, they talk about how the scenery is going be very small from Superstition Mountain. What about here? It's in your guys' front yard. You guys are going to face it every single day when you wake up. You guys are going to breathe the air of contamination of chemicals. You guys' water is going to be contaminated. So I'm standing here not only as an Apache, as indigenous woman, and as mother, but I'm standing here to protect all of you guys too, every single one of you. You all have a story. You all have a life. Neil, look at these people. They're going to be able to pass down their stories and their generations. What am I going to be able to pass down? And why aren't their lives just as important? Why isn't my life just as important? So remember those moral decisions. I would never want anything to happen to your guys' family, so don't let anything happen to my family, my religion, my niece that stood here, remember her. (Speaking Native language.)"

You have no value in the DEIS. You don't even talk about religion there. I don't understand why you don't. Religious freedom is given to people in the United States. People fight for religious freedom. But you're not even discussing religious freedom at all. And that means you're discriminating.

And all of us know -- all of us know that Apaches lived there and Yavapai people lived there and the Aravaipa people and a lot of people lived there. There's places that are shown that are there. But that isn't the issue. You're saying that you're going to take that and move it somewhere else. Why would you take somebody's body and move it somewhere else and say that that's okay. You know, it's just like going to a graveyard and taking somebody's body and moving it somewhere else and that that's okay. Well, it's not okay."
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","I have been with the tribe for 36 years and have been at this fight from day one. I think throughout the hearings you've heard everything that could be said. And, you know, to really make the people understand, you know it's a hardship for us. It's always been a hardship. And we don't want our children to go through that anymore and that's why it's so important that we had our daughter give you the paper because that's who you're deciding for, you know, a whole generation that we're going to have to live under these conditions. And what people don't understand here is that they're setting the precedence throughout the Indian country, in this whole country, and they're setting precedence about how much say we have on federal land. All people have a say on federal land, no matter where you live. I mean, it's really important that we exercise those rights that we have to say what's good and what's not. And I know you have Native people working for you, but I think you clearly see the difference when you have Apache people working for you. If you had Apache people working for you, you would have a lot done. And I know that sometimes you get other tribes to come in and do what they need to do, but they're doing it just for a paycheck. And that's what's really discouraging to me was because you should have had tribal members. You should have had our people. And look at our experience, significance. That's what you have in front of you, right there, the religious position that was left out totally. And so I'm discouraged, you know, with some of the Native people that work for you, because that should have been the very first thing that they should have made a big strong impact and they should tell that. You know, when you go to different regions, you need to understand that having people that live in those regions are very vital because we can help all these people, economically, educationally, healthwise. We're in a time now that we are all have to work together. We can't be separate. Because if we're calling this home, than we've got to treat it like home. We've got to care for one another. Who knows better than all of us here. So that's something important that, you know, as leaders or people in positions, they need to consider. And, for me, I just want to end it by telling you that I'm going home, because that's been the prophecy of our people. You know, I'm not going there to make trouble with you. I'm going home. I'm going to give up this American way because I don't want to be colonized. It's not that I don't want to be like a white person. It's just the colonization, the method that you guys live behind is what we're trying to stay away from because it's destroying everything. It's killing everything. That's what we see. And so people here, you're living in a region that we're old and we're new. Meaning that this new way of an American life, we see it. It's new, but it's scary because the old way has a lot of conditions that can help save the future, but you're not paying attention to it. So, for me, and when I say, ""I'm going home,"" I'm actually going home. I'm going home. I'm done with being a prisoner in San Carlos. I'm done living in that frame. Because there's no reason why a boundary should keep me away from where I originated from and that's what these people are saying. And so I know that Native people work with you, so I hope they understand and understand the importance of it and that's what they should be telling you, what's happening. So, again, I want to thank you. But I know you have to make that decision and I know you've got prayers behind you, you know, because it's death that we're rewarded for what we've done here in this world. It's not now, it's when we leave this world. Thank you."

I would just like to say that every since I was little, my family has been fighting for these fights [sic]. I remember -- I remember running and protecting our home on Mount Graham. And then always fighting for Oak Flat. And I just want to say, I'm tired -- I'm tired of these corporations trying to take my land, trying to hurt Mother Earth. Mother Earth doesn't need to be hurt. What's going to happen to all the water when it's gone? We all (unintelligible) water. So what's going to happen when it's gone? We all know we need the plants and the earth and everything. So why are you trying to take it away? Especially Oak Flat. Oak Flat has the acorn I pick. Ever since I was little, I would go there and pick it. So why are you going to take that -- why are you going to take that tradition away from me? What am I going to do when I have kids and grandchildren and I won't be able to take them to Oak Flat and show them the acorn and tell the stories that my great-grandmother would tell me about Oak Flat. So what are you going to do? And also Oak Flat is really, really sacred to me. It's in our traditional stories. And you say it's going to destroy like prehistoric and historic stuff. When I'm here present today and my family are here, we are not gone. We are not history. We're right here. Blood and everything. We're human beings and it's still -- and we're still protecting -- we're still doing traditional stuff at Oak Flat. So why you are going to take it away so that we don't do it anymore? When I honestly do it. So I would just like to say do not mine Oak Flat. Oak Flat is my home. They're going to destroy it. What's going to happen to the water and the air?

And they really have the help of Resolution Copper taking us down. But what I'm going to call for in this country is religious people to stand with me, because this isn't right. This is not right, morally. So if that is in your heart and that's what you believe, then we have to stand for what's left in this world. Because if not, it's all being destroyed by corporations. "
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","And I'm here in support, certainly of the indigenous issues that are impacted by this project, as well as -- I understand the project is moving forward. One of the things -- or some of the things that I see missing in the statement and how things are moving forward is exactly the impact to the water. How much? How fast? How huge this impact is going to be? We see all the numbers. It's hard -- it's hard to believe that those are all true. We, ourselves, our own family is involved in surface water rights and defending those on a state level and I know how hard we had to work to defend those rights. And I implore the -- certainly the Forest Service to really, really work with the engineers, work with everybody to do a bang-up job of beating that issue to death, in the analysis.The second thing is as it relates to the 1recreational areas. I have a son who is a rock climber, so I'm here to represent some of the climbers tonight attune to say: Okay, great this is going to happen. Now what's the financial commitment to really make the new area as good as it can be? Regardless of how far away and how awful it is, what you can do to make be an adequate -- I don't know if I can even say that -- replacement to what's being lost in terms of Queen Creek. So I encourage that piece. The third and last thing for me is the impact on the local community, as it relates to Superior. I understand and I've been reading everything in the newspapers that track all of the things that are going to happen. But where is the support to the infrastructure for Superior? You're going to have apartments. You're going to have more water. You're going to have more sewer, more everything. And where is the financial commitment and support from either the Forest Service or what you negotiate with Resolution to be able to support the requirements and what has to happen to really make Superior a vibrant town in light of -- we're all saying this is going to be wonderful for them, we don't see it yet. So thank you for listening and I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you."

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive",". Thank you everyone for staying so late tonight for such an important topic. I just want to preface what I want to say by describing what I do for work. I am an architect. I'm a licensed architect so I know the value of resources. I know how much copper goes into my buildings. I design K-12 schools in the Phoenix area. So I enjoy what I do for future generations. But I know that sustainability is critical to everything that we do. And as an architect in my firm, every project that we do, sustainability is absolutely key. So there's a better way to go about this than what's being proposed. So my story was I was brought to Oak Flat to learn how to rock climb. You know, we went by the cities of Superior and we saw the existing mines. We saw the mine near by. And then we walked through this incredibly beautiful riparian area. And the life there was just so special. And the quality of the rock is just out of this world. It's literally out of this world. It's such a unique place. And I loved how to learn -- how to rock climb there. I still climb there to this very day. This is Phoenix's local craft, you know. For those who do not climb, you just can't climb anywhere. I mean, there are so many diverse areas within the Oak Flat/Queen Creek area, as we've described it. There's an incredible diverse range of climbing here. So that is really, really worthwhile as a resource, you know, talking about resources such as metals. And the point I want to make about that is there's a group called the Access Fund, who stands up for climbing in America and they have called out the fact that this will be the single biggest loss of climbing resources at any one time in the history of our country, so, you know, think about that for a moment. And I want to reinforce the point that was made earlier about the economy. The outdoor industry is incredibly powerful and it's growing. It's not just climbing, it's hiking. It's camping. It's backpacking. It's mountain biking. Those jobs are local, you know. That is more worthwhile than these foreign investors coming in and proclaiming that this is going to help our economy long term. You know, we spend a lot of money on gear, let me tell you that. So climbers, you know, yeah we'll go somewhere else, if we don't have climbing here, sure. We're going to take our business to another city, to another state, to another country. We don't want that to happen, okay. Arizona is an incredibly beautiful state. Our tourism is super important to what we do in our state. So, you know, that as a resource needs to be defined, okay, and measured up against all of the other resources. In closing, I just want to say that -- the other point I wanted to make was about climate change. Just recently there were incredible climate strikes that happened all across this world. The youth raised their voice, okay. The future generations raised their voice, okay. And the impact, the carbon impact and the emissions from this is not something that was considered enough in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. So to be constructive, we need a balance here. We need a time out to say how can we do this properly, smart, all right. Tell your friends, okay. I know a lot of people that do not know about this. Do not give up yet. Thank you very much."
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","I was born and raised in Superior. I went to school there. And I worked in the mine for several years. There's some concerns that I have about it. First of all, it's never been explained to me adequately on why we can't backfill some of the mining areas that would occur. So having worked in the mine, I know that we used to use the waste to backfill some of those mining areas. Another concern that I have is that in all the time that I worked there, at that time it was Magma Copper Company. Magma Copper Company did not contribute too much to the town of Superior. And many of us grew up almost disadvantaged because a lot of us grew up in inadequate housing. And Magma never helped out. We didn't have a very good sewer system. We didn't have very good streets. Our schools were just getting by. We did get a lot of the coursework, classroom work that we should have gotten as compared to some of the other more sophisticated schools. So I haven't heard or seen anything that Resolution Copper has come out with to say, well, we're going to improve your streets. We're going to help those needy people who need housing. We're going to help with the rebuilding of the downtown area. We're going to help out with sewage that might be needed. We're going to help out with the garbage disposition. I haven't heard anything like that. So those are some of the concerns that I have. Then, lastly, I say, you know, this has been going on for several years. Resolution Copper trying to get this mine into effect. But I've seen very little activity other than public hearings coming out of all of you that have concerns about it. And what I want to tell you is that is in this country there are real change that has occurred, has been because people were willing to go out in the streets and fight for what they wanted, the Civil Rights movement, Cesar Chavez, the Civil War, doing away with slavery, that's how things got done by people going out in the streets and marching, you know, and risking -- risking their lives so that they could have change occurring. I'm not saying that you should go out there and get yourself killed, but for heaven's sakes I haven't seen any rallying or any demonstrating going on in the streets, you know. And that's what I think. I've got news for you, this is going to happen. This mine is going to happen and the only chance you have of it not happening is to go out there in the streets and fight for what you believe in. Thank you."

Without the 7B Ranch, the deal fails and they've been pumping up the value of that so that it can equal it. They're going to -- Resolution has spent approximately $18 million to get access to $130 billion worth of copper and they needed to make 7B Ranch look good. Now that's what they've done. Now, what you have is a contracting officer who went onto the GSA schedules and just selected somebody. And, you know what, it got to bothering me today because when he stuck his hand in the jar and pulled out a name, he just so happened to get Steven B.

It should be thrown out. It should be started again. The 7B Ranch and Steven Carothers cannot coexist in this deal. One of them has to go. You throw out 7B Ranch, it will invalidate McCain's deal.

I was raised by her in China Town San Carlos Apache Tribe Reservation, until I left for college. I remember the stories of her experiences in life such as: living in Young, AZ; the land of what is now Roosevelt Lake; in the valley of Phoenix, and visiting the Asian compound; riding through Superior through the mountains to Globe; leading through Peridot onto Bylas. She told me stories of camping at the Oak Flats and praying while there, how they collected medicinal plants, also Acorn which was the staple back them. She talked about the Red Berries they would pick and use as Koolaid to drink, she also talked about 'Noos' I never found it's original name. They also camped at the Top of the World and gathered Acorn freely. They consumed all these plants as food. She talked about the difficulties riding horses through the mountains. She said the Apache land was vast running from Point of Pines to Phoenix Valley, up to Camp Verde, they roamed freely. So when people say ""Oak Flats is not sacred"" I cringe because of the hardship my great grandmother went through in that area. All Apache land we view as sacred as people who endured hardship then are buried along the trails and [illegible]. I support ""Oak Flat"" and recommend it be returned to SCAT and protected by US National Forest. Thank you! "

I have some concerns about why we didn't -- you know, other alternatives weren't looked at because they weren't reasonable. But why weren't they reasonable?

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive"," I am taking this opportunity to shed some light on my beliefs and possibly open some hearts and minds about the importance of Oak Flat Campground as a spiritual and sacred place for me and my family. My family has been celebrating ceremonial rites of passage, birthdays and religious holidays at Oak Flat since before I was born and I have boxes of pictures to prove It. There was no other place we would go for birthdays, Easter, spring and fall times to honor earth and moon cycles. We also camped at Oak Flat to commune with nature, as we know how Important that is for grounding ourselves from time to time. My family would also Invite all of our out of town relatives and friends to this place of peacefulness. We love to commune with nature and all the natural elements found at this special place. We'd visit the petroglyphs found at many places, we'd see the animals from time to time, even saw a bobcat just sitting there watching us at one time. My mother would take us to pick the beyotas (acorns) and I loved eating them. She also picked Jojoba beans for many years before she died at the young age of 47. My mother loved Oak Flat and would take a blanket to lay under the huge, shady oak trees, That is one of the biggest, loving memories I have of her, loving to commune with nature and Its' bounty. I made sure to continue the traditions of my parents and we also still camp there and take friends and relatives to this sacred place. I was born the year Eisenhower signed a public land order, protecting this place from any future mining activity. ""Oak Flat Was so ecologically significant that both Republican Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon protected those lands. In 1955 Eisenhower signed Public Land Order 1229, which placed this land off limits to future mining activity,"" The Revelator, OakFlat:Govemment Complicity in Indigenous Sacred Site Desecration I continue to visit Oak Flat to pray and celebrate life and our ancestors. I give thanks to God, our Creator for the opportunity to carry the traditions forward, as I now take my grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, who sorely need the spiritual connection and grounding of Oak Flat, the place I call HOME, as much as my father's house in Superior. I feel richer and am humbled by the fact that I grew up in Superior, just 4 miles from Oak Flat and was able to visit at a moments' notice any time I wanted. Now I live further away and am heartbroken that the water Is being diverted, the animals are dying of thirst and the rich riparian area Is drying up. When is the mineral extraction process ever going to end and allow nature to regrow and thrive? There are other places that aren't so spiritually connected and sacred and to destroy Oak Flat would be an outrage and insult to humanity. I pray that you consider these thoughts and sacred spiritual connections that I hold dear. "

I grew up in North Central Arizona on a cattle ranch and I've watched that land dry. There used to be a stream that ran all year round -- or the creek rather and springs, they both dried up. When I was 17, I was lucky enough to turn that year in a wilderness program that was run by a Native man named Ezekiel Anansi, because I was sick from the greed that we are fighting today. I forgot about that. I went back to sleep and I operated heavy equipment from 20 to 25. And I bet if this guy did a little thinking over here, he could find another job, like I did. It breaks my heart. I saw the hole, as a climber, a mountain biker, a kayaker, a runner, a hiker, a backpacker, a camper, somebody who sleeps under the stars out there. It breaks my heart to see what's going to happen. I almost cried. I've walked Devil's Canyon. I've walked Hackberry Creek. I know the canyon trees. I know the birds. Just because I'm a white guy doesn't mean that that's not my church, it's not my spirituality, it's not religion. And, furthermore, if these two gentlemen were still sitting here, I would love to tell them how they should read some history books about what has happened to the Apaches. And they could start with one called ""Watch for Me on the Mountain."" We keep taking and taking and taking from these people, and saying, ""Oh, we'll just move this over here,"" like the reservations or the climbing areas. When is it going to stop? Never? Because greed doesn't end, right? It's a sickness. It's like a disease. It's like cancer. That dude is not a climber and him picking Conrad Anker's name made me sick. A wolf in sheep's clothing, that's what politics are. Everybody has talked about the money in recreation. I'm just going to hit that drum one more time. There's not only more money happening right now, but as we know as climbers, it's exploding right now because of movies like Alex Honnold and whatnot. Mountain biking is exploding. So that dollar value is going to continue to grow and grow. Whereas, this $3,700 job or jobs is going to go away. And, furthermore, as a kayaker who's ran the Salt, there is not -- so ten times more water is an accurate number than what's realistic, that's 5 million square acres. That's more than half the state in water. And the Salt doesn't even run year round anymore, only when it floods, that's it and then it dries back up."

We've got about 2,200 people in Superior. There's about -- there's less than that in Miami. Less than that in Kearny and Winkelman. Let me tell you something, anybody that believes the mining industry is vital to these towns is ridiculous. You're totally misconstrued. Show me a mining town anywhere that is a success with an active mine. You know what two mining towns is successful in Arizona, Bisbee, Arizona, and Jerome, because they ain't got no mines. I had something else to talk about, but let me share what somebody has said about the communities. Recreation brings in almost twice as much money in billions of dollars annually to the state's revenues and incomes. That's a fact. That's a fact from the mining industry. But let me say this, as we speak, as I speak right now, we talk about jobs, labor, good things for employees, because of the technology that's going to be needed at this depth, I mined there, I came out of there at 3,750 last night. The point being is at 7,000 I went down too. They tried to take me down to convince me that this great shaft project is unbelievable. It's unbelievable, but it's unbelievably hot.

The correct amount of a 50% increase based on the FY 2020 budgeted expenditures is $802,627. The $375,000 number seems to be based on the police budget alone and not police, fire, and ambulance. It also ignores the expenses of the RCM Emergency Services Contract. This factor alone requires a re‐think on the entire section, and perhaps the public safety section as well, as the revenue created by the current tax structure will not come anywhere near the projected expenses, and this needs to be reflected as a significant, neigh, huge, impact of mine operations. If the Town does not have sufficient revenue to increase our police force to meet this increase call load, the public safety of the community will suffer. The town does not have the resources to make up this shortfall in any other way. I am working on draft comments, but this would require a re‐think of many of our mitigation strategies.

My concern is for the people, ranchers, farmers and the resources for the economy for Arizona. Yes, copper, but also cattle and citrus. From what I understand the production of citrus is on the low. The water is in need for the livestock. With tailings not being 100 percent secure concerns me. I have heard Resolution will pay for cleaning water, but only to a certain boundary. That is unethical for residents living downstream. Tailings contain chemicals that its purpose is to breakdown the copper that can cause cancer. As a Hopi, my tribe has already experienced arsenic. And to this day, it is not being cleaned. As an Apache, I'm concerned for the storage of tailings close to our borders. To mine and to -- to mine and to drill for wells you need water. And from what I understand, this is going to be one of the largest in the world and it will need tons of water. Oak Flat has more resources for the public than -- from the public than the copper mine will provide. It's copper is not taxed and the cost is more to when we buy after selling it to other countries. As far as I know, these are ideas, not a solid plan. Arizona is not ready to support a copper mine. We have rights to land, water and air. The last thing, this is mental abuse to me and unethical to me personally. You are stealing my identity, as you did, with the land through a night rider. My children and their future children have a right to participate in their ceremonial religion and the natural harvesting on what was once public land. Let's get a repeal and get our land back. We say no. I just want to say that we have a precedence. This is not just Oak Flat. We are setting a precedence worldwide. There's a lot of indigenous people that are fighting because it was our steward -- we are stewards to the land. All the people that are not Native Americans, you have those same rights and I'm so thankful that you are here, because that is your birth right. That is everybody birth's right. So right here and now, I ask that you please stop because it needs to stop. You see all the climatries (phonetic), all the abuse you're doing to the humans, to the animals, to the plants it's wrong.

Nature Conservancy has worked long and hard to get 7B in the hands of the government through this land swap. They have received hundreds of thousands of dollars over a period of 17 years. What luck that an unbiased contracting officer at GSA would just happen to pick a guy who has been a powerful board member of Nature Conservancy for 30 years; to write the final approval document. He picked the worst possible choice... was that just by luck? Was FS decision to not act on information just a casual decision or a contemplated one. Do you suppose Carothers will just get a hearty slap on the back at the celebration party the night of approval? Or did he hit the jackpot with his conflict of interest. When questions of this type present themselves... history has proven that investigative action is the best medicine. Let sunshine show the facts...

It goes without saying that water in Arizona is one of the greatest issues and concerns in an arid state like ours. So, it was most reassuring to see that through the collaborative DEIS process that there were not any anticipated negative impacts to the water supply for communities inside and outside of the copper triangle. As the project moves forward, I encourage the USFS to continue to promote operational practices which conserve water to the greatest extent possible. Further, I appreciate the economic development and job creation that comes with development of a project of this scale. $8,000,000,000 for one project is a huge investment. The revenues local cities and towns in our region will see as a result of development of this project, particularly property and sales taxes are vital to the future of our State.

They're funding an incubator and entrepreneurship center in Superior to develop local small business.

There are approximately 60,000 jobs created by all mining industry subsidiaries in Arizona, thanks in part to opportunity projects like this. Today we mine exponentially more copper due to the increased demand. This is due to the fact that it is a key metal necessary for renewable energy initiatives, healthcare and technological advancements we have come to rely on.

"NP01","NEPA: Public Comment Period","NP","NEPA Process","We recently learned that the Tonto National Forest (TNF) has released a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Resolution Copper Mining Plan of Operations, and has opened up a 90-day public comment period that currently ends on November 7, 2019. We also understand you have scheduled five public meetings on this project in Pinal and Gila counties. As discussed below, ITAA requests that the Forest Service provide at least a 180- day public comment period for the DEIS. The DEIS is a very large and complex document (1,369 pages) and it has taken years to complete. The results of this process will have profound consequences on the interests of many of our Member Tribes and on the State of Arizona as a whole. At the moment, we believe that in order for ITAA to have sufficient time to review the DEIS and participate meaningfully in this process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the 90-day comment period will not be sufficient. 40 C.F.R. Part 1503.1(a)(2) states that after preparing a draft EIS, the agency shall request comments from “those persons or organizations who may be interested or affected.” ITAA and its Member Tribes have repeatedly commented on the effects of this project to the Forest Service, yet we have seen no evidence that these processes have been undertaken by the Forest Service to date. In ITAA’s experience, TNF will require at least 180-days to reach out to each of ITCA’s Member Tribes directly to offer and hold advanced and individual government-to-government consultation on the DEIS as required by the NEPA regulations (40 C.F.R. § 1501.2), Executive Order 13175, and the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act (P.L. 113-291, §3003(c)(3), 16 U.S.C. 539p(c)(3)(A)). It also appears that the Forest Service has failed to provide adequate notice of the issuance of the DEIS to interested stakeholders or the public at large. Indeed, notice of the Forest Service’s release of the DEIS and the dates for public meetings were not circulated to project website subscribers at www.resolutionmineeis.com until four days after the comment period began. Notice has still not been received by interested parties that have signed up for notice of Tonto National Forest activities through the USDA govdelivery.com email notice system. We have also yet to see notice via TNF postcard, as in the past. This failure could leave many interested stakeholders with significantly less time than even the 90 days provided. This should be corrected. As the public meetings are scheduled to begin in less than one month, this lack of timely notice may limit the ability of many people to comment and further discourage attendance by interested persons and tribal representatives around the state, particularly those who need to make special arrangements to attend these far-away public meetings. This should be corrected and a full 180- day comment period given. Finally ITAA requests that additional public meetings be set and held at locations in Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. All of the currently scheduled meetings (in Pinal and Gila county locations) are scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. at the end of a typical workday during rush hour traffic hours. This discourages attendance by interested persons living and working in metro areas. As you are aware, the Resolution Copper Project and Land Exchange is a highly controversial matter involving the interests of many different parties, including federally recognized Indian Tribes, recreational interests, the environmental community and other citizens and citizen groups. In order for the TNF to conduct a DEIS comment period that that complies with NEPA procedure, allows for meaningful tribal consulation, and allows for participation by interested parties, the TNF should extend this public scoping comment period by at least 180 days, schedule additional public meetings in Phoenix and Tucson, engage in individual Tribal consultation, and contact ITAA to discuss the DEIS project with tribal leaders. Footnote 1: We we are aware that TNF has been engaged with a number of tribes and the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) regarding the Resolution Copper Mining Plan of Operations. However, this is not a substitute for TNF’s broader tribal consultations obligations under NEPA with regard to the full DEIS. Footnote 2: Making matters worse, even those who have been monitoring the Federal Register for USDA/Forest Service notices on this project would not have received notice in this way, since publication in the Federal Register was not issued by the USDA/Forest Service, but rather, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of ministerial, weekly listing of EIS documents received by the EPA from multiple agencies.2 The information included in the EPA’s Federal Register batch notice is scant and fails to provide the typical information contained in DEIS Notices of Availability, such as a link to the DEIS, a listing of public meetings, project background, and instructions on how to comment."

That was before the earth began to shake under the force of the mine ... before the water showed contamination ... and before the area began to dry up. Sacred energy is resident in Earth's elements and God-made earthen habitat, not in the buildings or man-made structures. The elements at Oak Flat are about to be deplete. The riparian land of Oak Flat stands as a reflection of God. We have gathered here as a community, connecting to each other, to history, our ancestors, and to Spirit. We've cooked together, cleaned together, shared in awe of the Grandmother Tree. We hiked this area together, listening to the rhythm of gravel beneath our shoes. We shared stories, ate together, prayed together and danced together. We climbed up boulders and entered quietly into caves where we'd sometimes see bats hanging and we felt blessed for the experience. We waded through water, swam in Creator's pool, and sat with reverence at the hieroglyphics from the people who came before us. We were careful not to touch them so they wouldn't erode. We picked berries and acorns. We had ceremonies, dances, and drum circles by the fire. Often I would leave the late-night drum circles early so that I could listen to them from my tent until I fell asleep. I always had the best sleep at Oak Flat. I have also come here alone on many occasions and walked far on the lands. Oak Flat and the areas around it, are places where I can commune with other species, including the rare and elusive coatimundi that playfully scurried up, down, and around trees, like squirrels. Oak Flat brings me closer to Creator in a way that is unique to itself and it makes me a better person, able to be of greater service when I emerge again. Each area (Oak Flat, Hackberry Creek, Apache Leap, Gahn Canyon ... ) has its own energy and its own voice. If you get quiet, you'll find that God speaks loudly and clearly. You don't have to be Native American to experience this. Our spirits thrive here. We pray, give homage, and hold ceremonies here. We have gatherings and give thanks for the food from this area. We respect the land and allow Her to breathe and speak to us. She has given us Her heart and we have given back. This isn't just a campground. If you open your mind and heart, and hike deep and beyond the tents, rvs, and firepits, you will discover that there is something very sacred and very blessed. The campground is on the edge of land that is deeply Holy, no matter what your faith. Many places in the state and our nation are being destroyed. Among them is our sacred Chi' chil Bildagoteel (Oak Flat). Around the world, people grieve over church structures that burned: St. Joseph Catholic Church in Phoenix (50 years old); the Church of Visitation of Westphalia, Texas (124 years old); and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris (800 years old). The communities and parishioners' hearts ache as the man-made structures are left in ashes. In our culture, for those of us who understand Oak Flat as sacred ground (its existence as old as Earth herself of 4.5 billion years and civilization as old as 6,000 years), it is a place of quiet reverence without the pomp and circumstance of church bells and formal public services. Man did not create this sacred ground. God created this sacred ground. This area should be as respected as any church. A church can be rebuilt. Oak Flat cannot. As Oak Flat is set for demolition, it is a loss that leaves a deep wound running through our blood and our ancestry. For what may be the first time in history, sacred land was sold like a commodity to a foreign company. The sale of sacred North American land feels as tragic as auctioning off people into slavery. This is beyond an abuse of power. The water that flowed through and beneath Oak Flat, gave life to all of its inhabitants: the trees, vegetation, animals, and people. Chi' chil Bildagoteel is not an entity that is separate from us; She is not here for man to dominate. By destroying Her, man destroys himself. Throughout history, First Nations people are wrongly and inappropriately labeled as ""savage."" The true savage spoils the land, heritage, habitat, animals, and other creations that God gave to us. The savage is the one who contaminates the water we all drink and the air we all breathe. The savage is the one who callously demolishes for his own greed at the expense of all life. If you take away Oak Flat, the community has one less place to go. This is not simply about the campground. It is expansive. It is highly unlikely that anyone on colonized land would allow excavation of their church property. So why is it that our sacred land is set for unearthing? Water is not a Native American issue. Water is vital to all life. No one is exempt. Without water, the animals, plants, and trees die. Without clean water, we all die. The mining process sucks the life out of the land, steals the water, affects the water tables and aquifers, and impacts the entire Phoenix Valley while simultaneously poisoning the land, air, and water. Contamination is not limited to the area around the mine. We can see this in all mining areas. Air has no boundaries. When the wind blows, its currents will blow the toxic poison to Phoenix and surrounding areas, contributing to cancer and other maladies This is not the way God wanted us to live. It is not the way God wanted us to treat His land or our bodies. The mining process will hollow the land as if to gut the soul of the Earth. The people responsible are not seeing the bigger picture and they are clearly not aware of the magnitude of irreparable damage. Or maybe they don't care, and that's also a tragedy. The sale and abolishment of Chi' chil Bildagoteel, violates Freedom of Religion as much as it violates treaties and the livelihood of many tribes. John McCain knew this, otherwise he would not have entered it as a last-minute rider into the 2014 National Defense Act, where it did not belong. The land transfer will not only take away my sanctuary and the place where I commune with Creator and my extended family, it also devastates the community. It poisons the land, water, and animals. It is a disaster to Earth, the communities, and our spirits. This is a step backwards for human evolution and it is a step backwards for climate change. We, as people, are better than this. All over the world, including the United States, the Rights of Nature are recognized and implemented. According to Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund: In 2006, Tamaqua Borough Pennsylvania . . . ""is the very first place in the world to recognize the Rights of Nature in law. Since 2006, dozens of communities in ten states in the U.S. have enacted Rights of Nature laws. ""1 In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to recognize the Rights of Nature in its constitution. 2 In 2010, Bolivia passed the Law of the Rights of Mother Earth. 3 Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado, Oregon, and other states have incorporated the Rights of Nature in some way. Countries such as India, Mexico, Bangladesh, and Columbia have also implemented the Rights of Nature. All of these people recognize that Mother Earth, her streams and rivers as a living and breathing being. 4 More and more, people are becoming mindful and consciously aware of our interconnectedness to all life around us: 2019 - In the U.S., the National Lawyers Guild amended its constitution to include the Rights of Nature, stating, ""Human rights and the rights of ecosystems shall be regarded as more sacred than property interests ... "" s In 2015, Pope Francis, in calling for a new era of environmental protection at the U.N., declared, ""A true 'right of the environment' does exist ... ""6 Open your eyes and fall in love with the earth. See it as a place to be admired and revered. This is our home. This is your home. Earth is a life giver. We need to sustain her. We still have a chance to save Oak Flat and restore Her. Please don't allow our sacred site to be dishonored. Please spare this land from mining. All of our lives and wildlife depends on it."

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive"," When my daughter and I started our walk from Washington to Arizona to join the occupation to save Oak Flat in the summer of 2015, we could easily see the slippery slope America steps onto when giving away the land held in trust for all Americans - our national forests -to corporations. We recognized the travesty of justice taking place when, despite two failed attempts to get the land via legislation, Resolution Copper was able to finagle a midnight rider into a piece of must-pass legislation, foregoing tribal consultation. We clearly saw greed driving the destruction of a rare riparian desert ecosystem. We didn't have to be taught that water in the desert is valuable beyond measure. We understood the site was sacred to the Apache people who have lived there since time immemorial. We knew Apache religious freedom was not being respected or protected, though legal protection is supposedly offered in the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act. It was easy to recognize the injustice leveled at nature and the people of the Oak Flat region. But when we arrived, our experience of the Apache people, culture, and spirituality at Oak Flat was transformative. We began our journey without real knowledge or understanding of Apache spiritual life, but ended it with an unmistakable, powerful experience of the strength of the spirit at Oak Flat. Having been to Oak Flat many times has only deepened my experience that it is a place of great spiritual significance. A strong spirit lives in the five-hundred year old oak trees, the giant boulders, and life-giving springs. The people who have lived in harmony with this land, and protected it over thousands of years, give voice to what is unmistakable at the site: it is a sacred place. The spirit that drew us to Oak Flat is strong and alive in every sunrise and along every trail. So much life has been supported there over the history of humankind, learning that it is the heart of an Apache sacred site is not difficult to understand. I have never been compelled to walk across the country before or since; it was the strong spirit of Chi' Chil Bildagoteel that prompted me to follow the lead of the Apache people and stand up for the preservation of our natural world, particularly at this specific place. Oak Flat sits at the heart of a place known to the indigenous Apache people as the sacred home of the Gaan, higher spirits known to the Apache people since time immemorial. White settlers misunderstood the importance of the region when they interpreted the Apache language Gaan Canyon to translate to Devil's Canyon. While the settlers understood the canyon was of spiritual importance, they failed to understand the depth, breadth, or power of the Gaan. Gaan Canyon, properly understood, signifies that the Oak Flat region is similar to the Western culture equivalent to Bethlehem or Jerusalem. It is a place of great spiritual importance. It is where the Gaan - the specific entities in the religious and spiritual lives of Apache people - have touched the Earth. As one needn't be Christian to feel the spiritual power of the Sistine Chapel, it is not required to be Indigenous to recognize the strong spiritual presence at Chi' Chil Bildagoteel. Religious ceremonies are held in the area, and every tribal leader of the San Carlos Apache have publicly stated so since mining Oak Flat was first proposed. The past three San Carlos Tribal Chairs have stated: ""Our position is simple and straightforward. For the Apaches, this area, which includes Oak Flat campground and Apache Leap, belongs to the Gaan, who are our sacred Crowndancers. Since time immemorial, we have found refuge there and gathered precious medicinal herbs and traditional food there. Our goal is to protect these sites from potential ruin. Once they are lost, they can never be regained. Our people will not sacrifice our ancestors' legacy and our children's future for the political expediency of moving legislation forward that does not protect these sites. The Apaches will not, under any condition, allow our ancestral lands to be compromised. No society would allow for the religious desecration of their sacred sites and neither will the Apache."" -letter from Kathy W. Kitcheyan, Chairwoman of the San Carlos Apache Arizona Republic: Apaches will defy mine that threatens sacred lands, Aug. 28, 2006 ""Apache spiritual beings, our Gaan, exist within the three sacred sites of Oak Flat, Gaan Canyon and Apache Leap ... The Gaan are the very foundation of our religion; they are our creators, our saints, our saviors, our holy spirits. Imagine if this same type of mine as proposed by RCM lay 7,000 feet beneath the National Cathedral here in Washington, D.C. Imagine further that the mine was affected by a major subsidence, one that shook and swallowed the National Cathedral. Everyone would be outraged. Every person of every faith would fight to their last breath to prevent that mine from happening. Every American understands that the desecration of any one religion affects all religions, and that such an act even threatens the free exercise protections afforded under the First Amendment of the Constitution."" -Testimony of Wendsler Nosie Sr. Chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe Before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests. June 17, 2009 ""Today, the Oak Flat area continues to play a vital role in Apache ceremonies, religion, tradition, and culture. In Apache, the Oak Flat area is Chi' Chi! Bildagoteel (a ""Flat with Acorn Trees""). The Oak Flat area is a place filled with power - a place where Apaches today go for prayer, to conduct ceremonial dances such as the sunrise dance that celebrates a young woman's coming of age, to gather medicines and ceremonial items, and to seek and obtain peace and personal cleansing. The Oak Flat area and everything in it belongs to powerful Diyin, or Medicine Men, and is the home of a particular kind of Gaan, which are mighty Mountain Spirits and Holy Beings on whom we Apaches depend for our well-being."" -Terry Rambler, Chairman, San Carlos Apache Tribe Testimony before the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Legislative Hearing on H.R. 687 Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of 2013 It is not only the San Carlos Apaches who call the place sacred, but also other indigenous communities such as the White Mountain Apache and Tohono O'odham in the Arizona region; the Inter Tribal Council of Nevada, the United South and Eastern Tribes, Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes, the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, the Eight Northern Pueblos Council, the All Indian Pueblo Council. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAl)-the oldest, largest, and most representative American Indian organization in the U.S. - has long supported the absolute protection of Oak Flat. NCAI Resolution MSP-15-001 states: ""Oak Flat is a place filled with power-a place where Native people go today for prayer, to conduct ceremonies such as Holy Ground and the Apache Puberty Rite Ceremony that some refer to as the Sunrise Dance, which celebrates a young woman's coming of age, to gather medicines and ceremonial items, and to seek and obtain peace and personal cleansing;"" and ""Oak Flat has played an essential role in Apache religion, traditions, and culture for centuries and is a holy site and traditional cultural property with deep tribal religious, cultural, archaeological, historical and environmental significance."" The fact that Oak Flat is a site of great religious significance has been made clear. Since As for the U.S. government, it has been the legally stated policy over forty years to: "" ... protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians, including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites."" So says the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, adopted on August 11, 1978. Now, in 2019, we are called upon to demonstrate whether Americans are true to our word. Will we offer protection to our Apache neighbors for their sacred site? Or will we allow a mining company to exploit this sacred land for the sole purpose of creating more temporary and fleeting wealth for a few? Will we stand by our stated protection to protect and preserve the right to believe, express, and exercise Apache religion? The choice in this case is simple and clear: we must choose ethics over money. We must keep the promise we made to respect the Apache ways and stop mining efforts at Oak Flat. To dig it up and destroy it forever is like setting the chair you sit in on fire; what will be left in just a short time if we don't protect sacred Oak Flat? We cannot afford to find out."

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed Resolution/Tinto Copper Mine in Oak Flats near the town of Superior. My concern is not with the mining of copper per-se, but rather the dangerous, environmentally destructive and toxic tunneling method proposed for this particular mine. The underground dome and cavern created at the face of the copper is prone to collapse making it an extremely unsafe mining technique. Furthermore, this method requires extracting the rock used to create the cavern and storing on the surface, a process that will create many unsafe mountains of loose rock prone to slides. Finally, the extraction method will require the use of thousands of acre ft of water per year a considerable amount of which is proposed to be stored in one or more toxic ponds. No matter how safe you try to make them, the collapse of just one pond could spread toxic water over a large swath of land including residential areas. All in all, this mine as proposed would sequester over 2,000 acres of prime forest land encompassing the Superstition Wilderness and affecting part or all of Boyce Arboretum and the towns of Globe, Superior and Miami as well as Oak Flats, home of the San Carlos Apache Nation. Furthermore, in the face of Arizona's ten-year drought and the present threat of global climate change, we simply cannot afford to sequester thousands of acre feet of water a year or to damage 2,000 plus acres of oxygen producing and carbon dioxide absorbing forest lands in the pursuit of copper. This is particularly the case in light of the fact that there are more environmentally friendly, safer and higher job producing methods of mining copper. In brief, I urge the Forest Service and associated agencies to reject the land swap proposed by Senators McCain and Flake in conjunction with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014, and scrap the proposed Resolution/Rio Tinto Copper mine.

No evidence was presented that show employees who do not work or live in the Town of Superior would cause Town services to rise so dramatically. • The DEIS also reports that ""Resolution Copper has entered into an agreement with the Town of Superior to provide $1.65 million to support the Town's emergency response services over the period from 2016 to 2021, and other agreements to fund amenities and education."" However, the dollar amount is not included in the comparison of costs and benefits. The average annual value of this agreement alone is $330,000 and as such near-term benefits should increase. • No consideration was given to the fiscal revenue that would be created from new development for either residential or commercial. Yet the report estimates 450 new households over the long term, exceeding the current available housing stock in the Town. Also, previous mine openings have shown that new commercial development will be induced from mine operations, such as commercial suppliers and hospitality. Additionally, there is no recognition of the complete loss of opportunity and economic benefit in the discussion of the no action alternative. This needs to be included in the FEIS."

Oak Flat is an incredibly sacred place, the foundation or spiritual connection to culture and land for the Apache people. Today Oak flat lies just NW of the San Carlos Reservation, nearby Mt. Graham and Globe, AZ. There, I met an incredible Apache artist,, activist, and tender of the land, who told me of the sacred and essential qualities that Oak Flat has carried for generations upon generations of Apaches - the kind of value that is beyond measurement and would bring utter devastation to the Apache people, if lost. At the Oak Flat campsite (currently owned/occupied and managed by the US Forest Service), there's a grove of ancient Emory Oak tress that have been harvested and tended by Apaches for generations upon generations. Each year, Apaches return to these trees to harvest their acorns which they use as sacred, ceremonial food. ""This is our gold"", the Apache artist told me. These trees are irreplaceable. Today, between the trees, people bring their sleeping bags, tents, and campers to spend time in this incredibly sacred space, which along with the deep history of the Apache connection, is also marked with the sweet memories of US Forest Service campers, myself included. Although the Apache have cared for this land across generations, based centuries upon centuries (since the beginning of time) of Apache life on this land, today it is under extreme treat. Since the US government's theft and colonization of Apache land, Oak Flat has come under ownership and management by the US Forest Service. However, the US Forest Service and greater US government has failed to protect what they once promised to preserve - Oak Flat. By the authority of a rider on a military funding bill, Oak Flat is being traded for land along the San Juan River - to an international copper mining company called Resolution Copper. They plan to build a mine on the sacred lands of Oak Flat that will only last 40 year and will extract from the land it's sacred groundwater. The mining company has already begun to ""dewater"" Oak Flat, sucking the land dry of it's most precious and life-sustaining resource: water. Without water, the Emory oaks trees cannot grow, and without the Emory oaks, the essence of Oak Flat will be destroyed forever. And Oak Flat and Apaches are deeply interconnected, dependent, and spiritually reliant on one another: without Oak Flat, there would be no Apaches. If Oak Flat is lost, so will much of the Apache culture. What I want to express to you is that allowing this mine to be built is not only wrong, economically nonsensical, toxic and life-threatening to the environments and therefore all Apache tradition, religion, foods, culture, and future - but this project is VIOLENT. If the mine was about supporting Indigenous peoples, it would not exist. If the mine was about supporting the economies of San Carlos, Globe, and Superior, it would provide a pathway for rural economic resilience that could exist beyond an extractive, short-term vision - it does not. If the mine was about the Emory Oak trees, it would not forcibly remove the water that has supported their existence for hundreds of years. The mine is simply about putting money in the hands of major corporations that then put money in the hands of politicians that continue to disregard the sovereignty and essence of Indigenous peoples and cultures. It is no coincidence that the late Senator John McCain pushed the 2014 land trade rider to benefit Resolution Copper, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto; a top campaign donor for McCain's 2014 Senate race. It takes an Emory oak 100 years before a single acorn can be harvested. If the Resolution Copper mine is built, the entire stand of Emory Oaks will perish in less than 40 years. I know about Oak Flat because I've been there. I've been taught of its upmost importance by a young Apache visionary. And I urge you - no, I demand you - stop this land grab, stop this mine, stop the ravaging of the Apache land and people"

Instead, we put the emphasis on business/corporations, on moneyed/lobbied interests, and on the powers of individuals and minorities. Money and the economy are important but only as tools to make our country and our planet be a sustainable home for all humans and all life.

In our United States of America, protecting the rights of individuals regardless of race, religion, sex, etc. is a primary focus.

We don't need to be in a hurry to exploit non-renewable underground bounty; human generations to come will need copper, too, and are likely to have better technology to do so with minimal disturbance to the surface. The summary says ""The Forest Service assessed alternative mining techniques in an effort to prevent subsidence, but alternative methods were considered unreasonable."" That implies that current techniques for tunnel re-fill are considered too expensive at this location. The Black Butte copper project in Meagher County, Montana is initiating a project with tunnel re-fill that will allow efficient extraction of almost all the ore, by making practical the ability to drill right next to old tunnel locations. The re-filled volume has the strength to support directly adjacent tunneling. I assert that the depth of the Resolution deposit makes it likely that properly reclaimed mining does not have to impact surface activities or near-surface artifacts. I urge the consideration of a delay of this project, until such time as practical methods for avoiding destruction or non-trivial impact of the area's surface use become practical."

"NS01","Non-Substantive: General Support","NS","Non-Substantive"," I have been an elected official in Arizona for several years and represent the district adjacent to the district where the Resolution Copper mine is located. I am extremely supportive of this project moving forward and hope the United State Forest Service will quickly complete the Environmental Impact Statement. The positive economic impact this will have to the state of Arizona will be very helpful. Because I represent a district near the Resolution Copper mine, a functioning mine will help the economy in my district and our region. I am happy to see that impacts of the project to our communities have been analyzed and minimized to the greatest extent possible. I know mining can use a lot of water and it is reassuring to see that through the collaborative DEIS process that there were not any anticipated negative impacts to water supply for communities inside and outside of the copper triangle. As the project moves forward the USFS should continue to promote operational practices which conserve water to the greatest extent possible. While in the State Legislature, I have always tried to create and promote policy that will allow businesses to thrive. I appreciate the economic development and job creation that comes with development of a project of this scale. $8,000,000,000 for one project is a huge investment. The revenues local cities and towns will see as a result of development of this project, particularly property and sales taxes are vital to the future of our State."
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","The Apache people SHOULD NOT have to give up or lose their sacred land to a foreign mining company Resolution Copper! Oak Flat is considered sacred land to the Apache people of Az and should be left alone. No foreign mining company should ever have the right to just take or desecrate a sacred site ever! Rio Tinto, and other foreign mining company needs to leave Oak Flats and all other Apache sacred sites alone. Oak Flat is where ceremonies take place, where we pray, where we eat and sleep. Oak flat is a sacred place of ceremony and prayer for the Apache people. It is also where Sunrise dances take place for our young Apache women. Without out their sacred land, it will be heartbreaking for the people and for mother earth. So Resolution Copper needs to be STOPPED from mining on Apache sacred land/sites and SAVE Oak Flats!! #Landovergreedandmoney

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","I am strongly opposed to the Oak Flat proposal due to extraordinary planned-for impacts of the mine, the countless and likely unintended environmental impact of mass subsidence and extraction, and the continued disregard of Native American beliefs. The impacts that are predicted likely pale in comparison to those that will actually occur; the impacts of fracking, for instance, illustrate how limited human activities in one area reverberate across the region. Arizona mining companies also have a less than stellar reputation for following through with remediation processes, and I find it hard to believe they will have the impotus or even the funds to address the waste products of this project in 60 years. The beliefs of the Native peoples should not be a footnote, but they are usually treated as such, especially in this case, and I find it shameful to see, yet again, their communities' ways of life disrupted by corporate interests.

However, I strongly urge the Forest Service to consider and truly understand the major project issues outlined in the DEIS draft moving forward. Economic gains from mining in Oak Flats are temporary, but the losses to biodiversity, to the integrity of the landscape, to all use by future generations, to the Apache, and to other tribes are permanent. According to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, 90% of Arizona's riparian habitat is already gone-- probably forever. The stakes are simply too high; we cannot afford to lose one more body of water, letalone risk poisoning it.

Despite the emotional opposition shown at the public comment meetings which I attended two, there are a lot of people who are in favor of the project because it means prosperity for out communities for years to come. Also, the land exchange described in the DEIS shows that a greater area of high value biodiversity lands will now become public land managed by the USFS. This is a GOOD thing. While I value and have used oak flats for camping, climbing and hunting, more public land on the San Pedro river, clear cream and others is a huge benefit to the over all public! Please stick with what science and the data and the law says and don’t be swayed by small groups that have loud emotional responses and don’t care what the eis says or any other studies. Also, as an anecdote, my wife has worked at the San Carlos schools and I have worked with apaches and I’ve asked them about oak flats, most of them told me they had never heard of it until resolution copper and the land exchange made it a political issue. That’s right... all of the apaches I know had no idea it was a sacred place or even a place at all until this became a spotlight issue. There are other places to pick acorns, and something that the traditional apaches might consider is that the “creator” put the resource in the ground in that particular spot for a reason.

"ALT03","Proposed New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","In the presentation it states that the USFS considers that Block or Panel caving is the only method that can be used to mine the copper orebody. I presume that the USFS has been provided the technical and cost information and advice by the mining company to indicate that this is the case. In fact, this is incorrect, the orebody could be extracted by large scale Sub-level stoping, which has been used by other large copper mines. This method has advantages over a caving method such as 1) It requires less up front end development so production can start sooner, 2) Given the ventilation and cooling needs, it makes it easier and more efficient to provide adequate working conditions, 3) It allows a large percentage of the tailings to be placed underground in the empty stopes which considerably reduces the tailings disposal issue on the surface, and 4) It means no caving will occur and the surface will remain unchanged. It is in the public’s interest to know that a competent unbiased mining consultant has considered the design, capital and operating costs, and financial return on investment if Sub level stoping is used instead of caving. No doubt the USFS will be told that this method cannot produce the daily tonnage of copper ore that is expected from the caving method, and, therefore, the economics in terms of an acceptable rate of return will be inadequate. Since the use of Sub level stoping impacts many different aspects of the overall mine plan of operations, it cannot be known whether or not it is economic, unless a detailed study is carried out on using Sub level stoping and considering its accompanying advantages, to see if in fact the new design will end up producing an acceptable rate of return for the project. On top of this what must be considered and taken into account, is the benefit to the community of no surface subsidence which will eliminate some of the major objections to the project. Therefore, I urge the USFS to require a full feasibility study on mining the orebody using Sublevel stoping, to be undertaken by a competent and unbiased mining consultant.

"NP08","NEPA: Financial Assurance for Closure/Post-Closure","NP","NEPA Process","Although I am very concerned about the environmental impacts concerning the mine, I also cannot ignore the enormous potential this project can have on the community. One method or vehicle to ensure both needs are met is to establish what in the nuclear industry was call a decommissioning trust, NT). That will ensure that at the end of the life-cycle of the mine sufficient funds would be available to repair, reclalm and restore the land to if not its original condition at to one that is acceptable and hopefully better, environmentally and aesthetically. I propose the establishment of a mining decommissioning trust for that purpose. If the funding begins at the outset of the project, its financial impact could be mitigated and treated as an expense. It would of course need to have a custodian. This may also assuage the concerns of those who rightfully fear that at the end of the mine's life cycle, the community is not left with just the negative consequences. "
"NP03","NEPA: Purpose and Need","NP","NEPA Process","Please refer to the National Environmental Policy Act and The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations.

If the Purpose and Need section is not as broad as possible (as required by law), then the Alternatives section, which is the “heart of the EIS” will be inadequate. The Purpose and Need should be based on the fundamental need; such as supplying water -- NOT just whether to build a particular dam. If it is broad then various alternatives to achieve the purpose and need can be analyzed in the EIS such as; water conservation, converting existing water supplies under exchanges or sales, or other smaller or varied structural projects, or some combination thereof. Your stated Purpose and Need is “To consider approval of a proposed mine plan” and “the effects of the exchange of lands between Resolution Copper.” Such a narrow and singular Purpose and Need destroys the value of any of your analyses. Your Purpose and Need basically says: We will analyze the land exchange and mine that was shoved down our throats when they were sneaked into the Department of Defense appropriations by the project proponent (Resolution Copper) with the help of their corrupt politicians. It does not consider whether we “need” the copper to be torn from our lands by foreign companies, leaving their toxic waste on our public lands. It fails to consider a broader purpose.

The FEIS should consider whether there are additional government revenue streams that are not quantified in the current analysis. For instance the Town of Superior recently implemented a bed tax and completed a hotel feasibility study. The FEIS should also note that new mining investment will not only restore, but far exceed prior economic levels through new investment, high paying salaries, and enterprise development.

And the problem would be that if our water at Top-of-the-World was impacted by mine operations, you could not drill another well at Top-of-the-World, because you would be drilling a well into the same water that the mining operation impacted. It would be like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Returning back to Draft Appendix J, RC-211, page 9, I quote, ""It is assumed in many cases groundwater would be transported to GDEs via an overland pipeline to minimize ground disturbance."" If piping water to Top-of-the-World is the remedy for groundwater supplies and Top-of-the-World being impacted, please explain to me how that infrastructure would be put in place. Also, if this is the remedy, and because each place of residence has its own well, would you pipe water to each house that gives you permission to do so? Also, if this is the remedy, the complete system would have to be in place before any activity could be begin that might impact Top-of-the-World water supply. "

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","Last night at a public hearing on the DEIS I dropped the bomb that an illegal organizational conflict of interest exists between the mine and the environmental consulting company SWCA. SWCA gets its name from Stephen W Carothers ... founder and CEO. Nature Conservancy was given hundreds of thousands of dollars to increase the ecological value of the 7B ranch ... a parcel that represents 70% of the land swap for Oak Flat. Stephen W Carothers is a 30 year member of the Board of Directors for N.C. He is powerful and was involved no doubt in the transactions helping the mine arrange the land swap. By increasing the ""ecological value"" of the 7B it makes the land swap work. Resolution Copper benefits. Nature Conservancy benefits financially and achieves its goal of getting land its interested in, into federal hands where they can influence its use through lobbying. Now Carother's Company SWCA is getting paid a huge sum by the forest service to conduct the Environmental Impact Study ... a cost that will be paid by the mine. If this deal gets done I bet Carothers will get a ""big slap on the back"" ($) This plan began in 1996. It is a slow roll. But it was well planned and executed. It required about a hundred hours of research to uncover the connection between Carothers and the mine. This is called an ""organizational conflict of interest"" and is forbidden by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARS). The work on the EIS needs to stop immediately and all work performed should be sequestered as it is the fruit of the poison tree. A lawsuit to stop the work is probably going to be required. You MUST act immediately. I suggest you start by complaining to the US Dept of Agriculture Inspector General. I suggest indigenous groups immediately file a lawsuit for an injunction and a stop work order."

I've been trying to understand the water calculations, then you realize that the statement includes only net figures. You cannot tell how much water is going to be used to do the mining. How much is going to be used to do the processing. How much is going to be used to slurry the waste down to the tailings pond. We're assured that Resolution Copper is going to work hard to reuse their water and so they have these net figures. But are those realistic? The Arizona mines and mining department did a study about 10 years ago of actual water use in copper mines and they found that they're using about ten times as much water per pound of copper produced as this draft statement anticipates. There are other studies based on actual mines around the world that indicate that this mine's -- or the figures that are in the draft statement are about three times too low. The mine is, in other words, going to need at least three times as much water. And then when you look at some of the specifics, you find, again, that there's an understatement of the water that's going to be used and the principle one, this is disclosed in the statement, but the principle one is that the shafts are already acting as wells and the water that has to be removed from the shafts, and this 87,000 acre feet over the life of the mine, the water that has to be removed is not being counted as a use of the water. Well, right now that water goes down to Apache Junction and is used for agriculture. So if it's not adding to the supply, it's going to increase the demand when the mine comes in. And I think if you look at those kind of figures, you'll see that the estimates in this draft statement are simply not realistic"

"3.9.03","Recreation: Mitigation","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation"," I submitted comments to the Resolution Copper Mine EIS suggesting the concept of the purchase of a few hundred acres of private property to open up 38 square miles of public land, including the Needles Eye Wilderness area ,in Gila County on Route 77. This public land does not currently have public access. The draft EIS does not consider this concept. However I do believe the concept has merit. Is there another avenue outside of the Resolution Copper EIS that can be pursued to consider this idea? Below is a summary of the concept. I would be glad to discuss this idea with the US Forest Service or appropriate entity. [SEE COMMENT FOR CONTACT INFORMATION] Proposal There are a handful of private land parcels that lie directly on Highway 77 in Gila County, nine miles north of Winkelman. This location on Highway 77 is equidistant (70 miles) from both Tucson and the Phoenix East Valley. These properties are adjacent to and could provide public access to 25 square miles of BLM land and 13 square miles of the Needles Eye Wilderness that currently have no public access. The private properties and adjoining federal land are framed by the Mescal Mountains and Dripping Spring Mountains providing spectacular scenic views. The Needle's Eye Wilderness area includes a portion of the Gila River with steep‐walled canyons and thick riparian growth‐‐one of the most scenic areas in Arizona that is virtually undiscovered. Within 5 miles of this area, also on Highway 77, are two Gila River BLM boat ramps. Within a mile of these properties on Highway 77 is a jeep trail through BLM land that leads to Tam O'Shanter peak‐‐which at one time was proposed as a state rock climbing park. One or many of the private land parcels named above could be combined with the BLM land and placed under Federal management to create a magnificent new recreation area. The private land repurposed to Federal park land would provide the entrance to this new park and could accommodate higher volume public uses such as overnight camping, bike trails, motorized recreational use and nature hikes. The existing BLM property and Needles Eye Wilderness could have restricted usage and access which would be facilitated by the fact that the BLM land would be approximately 1/2 mile from the park's entrance (the Needle's Eye Wilderness would be 3 miles from the park's entrance) so the pristine nature of existing public lands could be controlled and preserved. The repurposed entrance property also could be used as a staging location for guided excursions to the BLM property/Needles Eye Wilderness, BLM boat ramps and Tam O'Shanter."

My personal opinion is this land should not be sold to a multinational conglomerate that will not add any benefit to the local cities/county/state but instead will rape the land of anything of value and leave it in a situation that has been seen in other parts of AZ where the mines still haven't been cleaned up, leak wastewater that is unhealthy, if not deadly, by any measure, and caused land values to plummet around it.

As a result of removing large continuous masses of rock, the overlying ground surface inevitably collapses to fill the void. Also water contamination is a serious concern. Both surface subsidence features and underground structural changes heavily alter water drainage patterns and groundwater flow. Water is captured by the subsidence features, and percolates downward into the fractured waste rock and remnant ore. There, it can absorb heavy metals and metalloids or react with disrupted sulfide rocks to form acid (""acid mine drainage""). Contaminated water from the mine may enter the groundwater system, pollute aquifers, and resurface to cause problems elsewhere."

The economic development and job creation that comes with the development of a project of this scale is critical to copper triangle, the east valley and the state as a whole cannot be overlooked or undervalued in this process. An $8 billion investment and the creation of 1,500 permanent jobs would result in significant economic development, employment, and much needed revitalization of the region.

"3.11.01","Scenic Resources: Federal Viewshed Management Systems","3.11","Section 3.11 - Scenic Resources"," I am concerned about the impacts to the scenery and in turn recreational aspects of this project. In particular I question the methodology used and the applicability of it to ensuring that the Tonto National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan is being met. The methodology for the analysis conducted in Newell and Grams 2018 is based on the BLM Visual Resource Management guidance not the USFS Visual Management System (VMS) yet the bulk of the lands being analyzed lie not on the BLM but on the USFS and the USFS is stated to be the lead agency. In the DEIS a discussion is had regarding the two systems but there is no cross-walk of how using the BLM system ensures compliance with the USFS direction. Likewise the VMS has been replaced in 1995 by the Scenery Management System (SMS) for the USFS. I recognize that the Tonto's Forest Plan was written under the VMS system and I assume with the new forest plan the SMS will be adopted but the lack of discussion of this new system and the updated methodologies, research and guidance within the SMS is problematic. I question whether the VMS is the best available science for review of the impacts to the scenery resource when there is no use of the more recently developed SMS direction. In the DEIS there is a discussion of measuring the impacts of the project for the scenery resource by examining the dominance of the management actions to the natural landscape by measuring the following design elements: form, line, color and texture. These are present in the VMS direction and in the SMS direction, although the SMS direction also discusses pattern as an element which is not discussed in the DEIS. There is also no discussion of the variables discussed in the VMS handbook #434 about scale and time. These elements are elaborated on in the SMS as well and I think are relevant to this project and its management actions. "
"3.11.03","Scenic Resources: Visual Simulation","3.11","Section 3.11 - Scenic Resources"," Primarily I do not see a discussion of how the tailings piles are designed nor find any mitigation measures or design features to reduce the contrast in form, scale and pattern when compared to the natural landscape. The visualizations presented in the Newell and Grams 2018 document indicate many discernible differences in form, pattern and scale. The discussion of these tailings states that the color would be medium gray and the visibility would increase over time and dominate the view by changing the form, line, color, and texture but again there is no discussion of the pattern or scale differences of these piles. Furthermore there is no discussion I could find about the duration of time that visitors to the KOPs might spend looking at the tailings piles and the impact of this to their sense of place and experience of the landscape and Tonto National Forest. In many of the visualizations the color and texture of the piles is shown to not be a medium gray but rather a fully revegetated desert vegetation appearance and the discussion includes an expectation the the vegetation regrowth would be swift but I see no rationale for how it would be swift nor a mitigation to plant these piles and modify them to better mimic the natural landscape pattern and texture. In the Resolution Copper proposed FS-226 there is a discussion of a plan for seeding and planting but this would be post closure, which provides a long duration of time in which these areas would indeed have scenic elements that do not mimic the pattern or texture of the surrounding landscape and would be medium gray in color with no vegetation to create any semblance of the texture, pattern or color of the surroundings. Therefore I find the statement the revegetation mitigation would be a short-term one to be disingenuous. The DEIS Scenery section implies that Resolution Copper has committed to perform concurrent reclamation of tailing embankments at about year 10 and use reclamation seed mix and use colors that blend with the desert environment but I do not find these listed in the Appendix J so I question the honesty of these commitments and where they are stated other than in the DEIS Scenery Section. Finally in the visualization for Florence Kelvin Highway the tailings pile appears to be painted to match the sky. I'm not sure this is an acceptable mitigation measure for reducing the contrast of this very dominate alteration to the landscape and question the feasibility of this option if this is indeed an accurate visualization of this management action. "
"3.11.01","Scenic Resources: Federal Viewshed Management Systems","3.11","Section 3.11 - Scenic Resources","Overall I am concerned that the aforementioned discussion of missing or perhaps non-rationale explanations for the analysis and mitigation measures to the scenery resource will meet the forest plan and in particular MA 3I which states an emphasis on renewable resources including wildlife habitat, livestock forage production and dispersed recreation. In this and MA 2E the scenery resource is described by a guideline to base achievement on the percent of VQOs presented in a table under each management area. No where in the scenery section of the DEIS is this addressed other than to say a forest plan amendment to change the Retention and Partial Retention to Modification would occur. Yet there is no tie back to whether these collective percentages for the management areas are still met, nor how the amendments would ensure the renewable resources are still emphasized with these project management actions. Lastly there is no rationale as to why the amendments are justified for the benefit of another resource etc. They are only rationalized as the project won't meet the forest plan based VQO direction as it is so therefore we're amending it, but this is an unjustified rationale and disingenuous to the intent of a forest plan. What is the point of a forest plan if every time something doesn't meet it you amend it? "
"3.11.03","Scenic Resources: Visual Simulation","3.11","Section 3.11 - Scenic Resources","Lastly, I am concerned about the Newell and Grams 2018 visibility related to the KOPs. First the analysis area is stated to be buffered off the project components for the scale rather than from the KOPs. In looking at the Appendix A of that documents visibility analysis it is clear that there are locations outside of the 6 mile buffers that have visibility into the project area, assuming the purple for example represents the most highest amount of visibility. These visibility analyses are furthermore confusing because the narrative implies they were generated from the project components looking out i.e. where on the landscape can they be seen but the numerical values of the key imply that the colors are based on the number of KOPs that can see a pixel of ground? I believe this analysis as presented is flawed. There should be a demonstration of what is/isn't visible from the KOPs as well as an explanation of how these KOPs cover the spectrum of available views of the project. There is no description as to why one point on the Arizona Trail was selected over another for example. The data and rationale maybe sound but it is not presented in a sound way in which a member of the public can feel comfortable that the analysis is complete and accurate."
"3.11.01","Scenic Resources: Federal Viewshed Management Systems","3.11","Section 3.11 - Scenic Resources","Lastly the VMS states that distance zones should be analyzed at foreground a distance between 0 and 1/4 to1/2 mile, middleground between 1/4 to 1/2 mile and up to 3 to 5 miles, and finally for the background greater than 3 to 5 miles to infinity. The SMS refines this to immediate foreground 0-300 feet, foreground 300 feet to 1/2 mile, middleground 1/2 miles to 4 miles, background 4 miles to the horizon. There is a statement that these were modified for this project due to the desert landscape conditions but this is not explained as to why the desert landscape is different and warrants a different distance zone parameter. The visibility analysis presented would seem to indicate there is visibility beyond the 6 mile distance presented so I question the validity of this methodology. These concerns lead me to believe that the impacts to the scenery resource may be understated in this analysis and DEIS and the methodology used to come to the conclusions regarding the level of impacts maybe flawed and not using the best available and most appropriate science."

As a business with a significant presence in Arizona, our organization recognizes and appreciates the economic benefits the mine will deliver for the state of Arizona and the local community opportunities it will provide for the Superior mining area. The revenue and jobs generated by this project will certainly have an important and long-lasting impact on Arizona’s economic future. The project also presents a significant opportunity for our nation, as it is one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper deposits and will provide a long-term supply of copper— essential to our everyday lives. Based on our review of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), it is the collective opinion of ME Elecmetal’s leadership team that the United States Forest Service has conducted an extensive and independent study of this project over the past several years which has included public engagement and involvement. Input from resource specialists, mining experts, cooperating agency representatives, tribes, and other key stakeholders has been considered and incorporated into the planning and development of this project. The recreational mitigations detailed in the DEIS demonstrate Resolution Copper’s commitment to significantly invest in the local community and its economic development strategy, as well as to help preserve the area’s cultural heritage. It is our hope that the United States Forest Service will expeditiously complete the Final Environmental Impact Statement and settle in favor of moving this project to fruition. ME Elecmetal appreciates the opportunity to comment in the NEPA process for the Resolution Copper Project."

Specifically, our comments are as follows:  The USFS has issued its draft EIS for the land exchange and the mine. Queen Creek · Coalition believes that additional items are necessary to mitigate the impacts of the Land Exchange and Mining Plan of Operations on rock climbing. We appreciate that the USFS included mitigation for the loss of bouldering at Oak Flat, specifically we support the inclusion of The Inconceivables bouldering area as mitigation for that loss. However, we feel that additional mitigation is needed for the loss of rock climbing access. The Land Exchange and Mining Plan of Operations impact rock climbing, but the primary impact is on the use of USFS roads to get to the rock climbing crags. With some exceptions the rock climbing crags themselves are NOT within the zone of mining operations and will NOT be lost. However, the historic FS roads used to access them will be gone. Therefore, QCC believes that the proper mitigation is the replacement of the USFS roads that are lost with reasonable alternative alignments/replacements. Here are the specific remaining climbing crags and FS roads in question. A map attached helps locate the climbing_ crags _and roads. Mine Area-: Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and a small parking lot just outside of RCM's mining plant for the #9 and #10 shafts. The replacement access could be a parking lot and trail at locations agreed to by the relevant parties but outside the .zone of mining operations. Upper Devils Canyon - Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and the old alignment of Highway 60 that heads easterly from just n01th of the Oak Flat campground. This is currently designated at FR 2438 and we wish to keep this as the access to these impo1tant rock climbing crags. Lower Devils Canyon - Hackberry Creek - Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and the FR 315 that heads south from it before turning back north to the current Mining operations on top of the Leap. The replacement access QCC is requesting involves the use and improvement of USFS FR 315 that departs Highway 177 south of Superior. Apache Leap - Historical access has occurred from the top of the Leap and via Magma Mine road and FR 315 dirt road that heads south to Lower Devils and Hackberry Creek. From there long hiking paths lead to the top of the Leap and rappelling into the climbing. The replacement involves use of USFS FR 2440. This ""west side approach"" allows for the preferable approach from the bottom of the climbing areas. Northern Devils Canyon - While not within the lands impacted directly by the Land Exchange nor Mining Plan of Operations, Northern Devils access should be secured. Historical access has occurred on the USFS FR 342 road that departs Highway 60 heading n01th to a power substation sho1tly east of the intersection of Magma Mine road and Highway 60."

The avoidance of federal land is probably related to a recent court decision which held that large swaths of federal lands cannot be used strictly for waste disposal purposes under the General Mining Act of 1872. If the use of federal lands close to the mining site is not possible because of concerns related to the Rosemont case, there are other state and private lands in much closer proximity to the proposed mine site. This would at least provide the opportunity to minimize the permanent footprint and fragmenting “sprawl” effect of the proposed mining operation, and could even provide an option to someday return the tailings to the enormous 2-mile-wide pit that this block cave mine will create.

The first sentences states: Resolution Copper has publicly agreed to implement the mitigation and monitoring items under this heading. However, the very next paragraph states: These measures differ from the Applicant-Committed Environmental Protection Measures in that they were not proposed as part of the project or alternatives and in many cases were developed directly in response to the EIS analysis in order to reduce resource impacts. Since the Forest Service and regulatory permitting agencies cannot require implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures in this category, their implementation is not assured (emphasis added). Consequently, no measures listed under this section can be considered “Applicant Committed”. The measures that are listed are only conceptual in nature. As a result of this lack of detailed mitigation commitments, the DEIS is not in compliance with NEPA.

It is unclear if mitigation would take place at more than one site or how much mitigation would actually be required. With respect to the proposals, the GRIC MAR 5 site (after 2 years of supplemental water) appears to have developed little riparian habitat; instead it has a proliferation of non-native salt cedar, Bermuda grass and barnyard grass. This does not appear to be a suitable site for compensatory mitigation. Likewise, the Oldberg Road Restoration Site is another unsuitable compensatory mitigation option. This site is located immediately upstream of the GRIC MAR 5 site and is heavily infested with salt cedar. The proposed mitigation is to remove the salt cedar that is providing the seed source and impacting the GRIC MAR 5 site. We believe that the MAR 5 and Oldberg Road Restoration sites would not provide appropriate compensation to offset the “waters of the U.S” (WOTUS) values lost as a result of the proposed project. The remaining 3 conceptual mitigation options may provide compensatory mitigation for lost “WOTUS” values, but again, without knowing exactly how much mitigation will be required and which sites will be utilized, we are unable to provide meaningful comments.

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive",": I visited Oak Flat for the first time this fall, and spent the night in the Forest Service Campground. That night, an artist from the San Carlos Apache visited the group that I was with. She brought acorn meal made from the same ancient Emory Oaks that we slept underneath for us to taste, and spoke about her experiences growing up native in central Arizona. All night, we could see the lights from the Magma mine, shining from a ridge near Apache Leap, where about 75 of warriors leaped off the cliff to their deaths rather than surrender during the Apache wars. I have since looked into the process by which the Resolution Copper Mine land swap was achieved, and read much of the Forest Service's draft environmental analysis. There is little about this intended development that makes ethical, environmental, or economic sense to me. Central Arizona depends on its precious groundwater; the Resolution Mine will wastefully use it and poison the rest. Endangered and endemic species will be extirpated. The Forest Service is forced by irresponsible and inappropriate legislation to work (for free) for an international corporation-- whose only firm promise is to extract at an unsustainable scale for a short time, and then leave the taxpayers and locals holding the bag (which will include toxic tailings in an unprecedented amount). And, most horrifying to me, this entire process has taken for granted that the Apache Nation's sacred sites are for sale. I stand with Apache Stronghold in their opposition to this mine. I am white, and cannot claim any religious attachment to the site, but it is of supreme importance that others, especially those whom this country and culture has treated unfairly for so long, maintain their spiritual and cultural access to sites of importance and meaning. The activist I mentioned at the beginning of this letter told us about religious coming-of-age ceremonies that take place at Oak Flat. What does it mean for someone to literally become a woman in a place that is then willfully destroyed? Land is ""protected"" until the military decides to use it. Or a mining company. Or ranchers. And then that protection seemingly evaporates. There are almost never repercussions. There is a reason this land swap was snuck in through the back door on a must-pass spending bill.

We are at a turning point in history. To discard this kind of knowledge of place, of tradition and custom is discarding a huge gift. As settlers on this land I think we need to step back and learn from the people who are of these places. Have some respect. Be good guests. The alternative is building another mine that puts profits in the pockets of a few and poisons the rest. This issue is important. I live in San Francisco. I am a teacher.

Although our organization is based in Oregon, we have been welcomed by Apache Stronghold to support their peaceful protest at Oak Flat over the past three years. In that time, we have introduced (through in-person visits) nearly 100 artists and cultural workers from throughout the world to the place known as Oak Flat. If anyone reading this has never walked across the mesa at Oak Flat, scattering lizards and stepping between juniper and prickly pear, down into the cool shade of the oaks themselves; If you have not seen the canyon in flash flood, a place of powerful water and natural systems; if you have not witnessed firsthand the ecological marvels of this special place, then I implore you to take stock of your life and priorities. The proposed project represents a vast amount of money for a foreign corporation and a pittance of jobs for a mining boomtown that has no sustainable reason to be. The damage of this proposed action would be of devastating collective loss foremost to the Earth, to the relatively intact ecological systems of this desert wonderland, and to the Apaches, who have cultivated a spiritual and social relationship with this place for many generations. Other impacted parties include recreationists like myself, who seek solitude and an atmosphere of natural beauty when we camp, as well as the general public, whose wellbeing is negatively impacted when the land we've been entrusted to safeguard is violated and destroyed to that few may profit in the very short term. No to Resolution Copper! No to backdoor shady land trades! Please keep Oak Flat safe and open for play and prayer and vital ecological health! Thank you for your time and attention, Ryan Pierce

"3.9.03","Recreation: Mitigation","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","Dear Supervisor Bosworth, Members of the Superior Recreation User Group (RUG) request that the Forest Service incorporate the RUG plan, as presented in Attachment 1 of Appendix J, in its entirety into the Record of Decision as part of the required mitigation for the combined recreational impacts of the Resolution Copper Project at Oak Flat and Skunk Camp areas. Further, we request that Resolution Copper Mining establish an endowment to fund the construction of this trail system and partially support long-term maintenance as may be needed to supplement volunteer efforts of user groups. This group believes that the RUG plan is appropriately crafted to serve as partial mitigation for this project. As presented in the DEIS, combined recreation impacts associated with Oak Flat and tailings Alternative 6 Skunk Camp include the loss of 38 miles of recreational roads, 1,282 acres of area available for dispersed camping as well as loss of Oak Flat Campground, 1,457 hunter days per year with associated reduction in tourist spending of about $81,000, loss of scenic values and wildlifewatching opportunities to visitors, and loss of rock-climbing access in this highly important location (addressed in mitigation RC-213). In addition to direct mitigation for project-related impacts, the RUG plan has the potential for attracting regional and even national visitor use due to its unique scenic qualities and connections to other important recreation resources such as the Arizona National Scenic Trail and Legends of Superior Trail, the Boyce Thompson Arboretum, and the services available in the Town of Superior. Implementation of this plan would provide opportunities for ‘world-class’ outdoor recreation and serve as an important economic development catalyst and anchor to the town and the region. As background information, The Recreation User Group (RUG), a subcommittee of the Superior Community Working Group, spent nearly 4 years in a collaborative effort to develop and agree on this plan. This was done in consultation with the Town of Superior and the Tonto National Forest, and with financial and technical support from Resolution Copper Mining. This comprehensive effort was intended to coordinate the individual proposals and requests of various recreation user groups. Representatives of all the various recreation user groups have participated in developing the RUG plan, which accommodates both motorized and nonmotorized users and includes a campground. Both the size of the study area and the number of miles of trails have been substantially pared down from the initial proposals offered, in the interests of environmental impacts and funding concerns. The trail system has been field-verified for constructability, and participating user groups stand ready to support both implementation and long-term maintenance through volunteer efforts. Resolution Copper is offering this plan as mitigation for recreation impacts of the mining project and would therefore be an important potential funding source. When established, the endowment should be managed by a local nonprofit organization led by the Legends of Superior Trail (LOST) with significant board participation by other RUG contributing organizations. It is contemplated that the LOST-led operation could partner with the Arizona Community Foundation or similar organization. While the RUG recognizes that proposed mineral exploration by Bronco Creek Exploration in this exact location is not part of this EIS, we continue to have grave concerns about its potential effects on the RUG trail plan. Since the proposed RUG trail system is being offered as an environmental offset to the Resolution Copper Project, owners BHP and Rio Tinto must be required to certify that it will remain so. The property on which the RUG trail system is located must either be bonded for full value against mineral exploration involving drilling or other disruption and mineral exploitation, or the mineral rights must be signed over to the Town of Superior. This is a requirement given that the integrity of this environmental offset is under question due to mining exploration proposals. Members of the RUG are most grateful for the support of Resolution Copper Mining in crafting this plan and in offering it as a mitigation measure for the loss of recreational resources inherent in mine development. We urge you to adopt it as an integral part of the project in your Record of Decision."

Tailings ponds are not accurately accounted for in terms of cost to the environment and the communities that will be altered for generations to come. If the mining company can Guarantee a return of the area to its prior state (I e clean of the mining site after they close down) then we have a basis to begin considering whether a mine in this particularly important land site has merit.

"NS01","Non-Substantive: General Support","NS","Non-Substantive","Thank you for the issues you addressed in the DEIS, analyzing various alternatives to address socioeconomic and environmental factors while considering that minerals are essential for human well-being and fundamental for all sectors of our economy. As a local contractor working with Resolution Copper, we are thrilled to be a partner with a company who has invested in the local Copper Triangle communities, where approx. 90% of our employees reside. Resolution Copper’s commitment to employing from within the local communities has allowed us to provide over two hundred employees over the course of the past five years. Resolution Copper has excelled in their commitments to employees, local communities, safety and the environment. We look forward to the peak years for goods and services purchased and employment to further boost our local and state economy. Public health and safety due to subsidence, increased traffic, effects from air and water quality are analyzed in the DEIS. We support your selection of Alternative 6, due to its distance away from communities and infrastructure, a footprint adjacent to an existing mine, and the mining methods, operations, monitoring, and restoration that can be implemented at this location. We endorse the proposed mining methods with lower operating costs and high capital intensity, creating better projected opportunities with less layoffs for better long-term socioeconomic stability for employees (less ‘Boom and bust’ vulnerability). With the Copper Triangle community of Superior projected to have 1,523 direct mine employment jobs (annual average between years 2021-2079) and 298 secondary jobs (generating approx. $145.5 million in labor income), and other Copper Triangle areas projected labor income about $6.6 million, we appreciate and support this opportunity created by the proposed Resolution Copper Project. Those same projections reveal long term “steady state” employment beginning in 2029. Even though the county based economic models project about 80% of the economic indirect “multiplier” effects to occur outside of the “Copper Triangle” - in Maricopa county due to its close proximity and available amenities, the beneficial effects on employment in Superior are substantial for the areas social and economic stability over time. Maricopa and Pima counties are also projected to gain socioeconomic benefits, having major suppliers for mining operations, as well as goods and services. We appreciate and support the projects activities that contribute to these benefits to our states’ economy (i.e., $134 million/year employee compensation, $546 million/year for goods and services, as well as billions from severance and revenue sources). Further, we endorse the creation of the Apache Leap Special Management Area and other mitigation to reroute established trails and OHV routes that would be adversely affected by the action. As a local business, we understand how our tribal neighbors view natural resources, including Oak Flat. However, not all tribal members oppose the mine or view Oak Flat as sacred. We currently employ nearly thirty members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe working on the Resolution project and more will likely work on the project during construction and operation. Many of these views were expressed during scoping, but have not been incorporated into the document. We urge the Forest Service to incorporate the views of individual tribal members and to disclose that information in the Final EIS rather than relying on a single viewpoint from the project’s most vocal opponents. Thank you for your continued efforts to safe-guard all natural resource protections and multiple uses, making decisions based on facts. Our previous pertinent comments provided are incorporated into this comment letter by reference. We appreciate the opportunity to submit our comments and look forward to review of any additional information as this project moves forward. We believe in Resolution Copper, a sustainable copper mine for our future generations. "

There are many other methods, such as high wall mining, that may be better for the environment.

We are concerned that the destruction of OHV trails in the Resolution Copper Mine subsidence area will have an impact far beyond the loss of those specific routes for recreation. FR315, and trails accessed by it will be destroyed by mining activity. But surrounding trails such as the very popular Devil's Canyon will also have greatly diminished value for recreation with the loss of the spectacular views currently available. Exploratory and monitoring drill pads in the area and near existing trails also detract from the natural beauty of the area.

Favoring private businesses, and the whims of an executive board looking for profits, over the well-being of locals (however identified), will further erode communal faith in this state and the leaders within.

This land is indigenous and has gone through so much exploitation at the hands of those that wish to seek profit instead of healthy livelihoods for all people; 500 years and counting of colonialism. Although I am not a member of the Apache tribes I am a descendant of indigenous people's from México and due to ongoing settler colonialism much of what is happening to my indigenous roots is happening to native folks in the so-called United States. All native communities wish for the same, that their lands be taken care of for present and future generations, that these lands be able to provide physical, emotional and spiritual sustenance. If these lands, which hold sacred sites are desecrated by those who wish to profit and exploit the very soil that feeds us all, then where will current and future generations of Apache peoples go to find peace, relationship & spiritual connection?

There are numerous cumulative impacts that will affect the Arizona National Scenic Trail. There will be tremendous population growth for the Superstition Vista area as well population increases around Superior. The inclusion of the Recreation Users Group multiuser trails south and southwest of Superior is part of a recreational infrastructure that will draw numerous visitors for hiking, climbing, horseback riding, mountain biking, and motorized rides. There are cumulative impacts from proposed mining activities throughout southern Arizona. The approved Rosemont project—now on hold waiting an appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals— will bury the AZNST under its tailings with the trail being relocated. Within the Oracle to Superstition Wilderness lineal area are a number of mining projects being proposed or underway. The approved ASARCO Ray Mine tailings storage facility on Arizona State Land west of Kelvin/Riverside will also bury the trail and the trail will be relocated with views of the tailings at the beginning of the south end of the reroute.

There is little precedence (if none) for a mine at this depth, removing an ore body this large, to have observable results to compare to the modeled results for subsidence outlined in the DEIS. The DEIS states that assumptions, albeit conservative, were made and admits to areas of low confidence in the data that produces uncertainties in the modeled results. Subsidence resulting from dewatering, which can be significant, was briefly covered in a separate section but did not appear to be taken into account during subsidence modeling. The inter-relationship between subsidence resulting from removal of the ore body and the regional dewatering must be considered. Again, due to the scale and depth of this project, there are too many uncertainties with the subsidence model to safely move forward with the project as proposed. The mitigation proposed is to continue to monitor subsidence and update the subsidence model with the monitoring data. I am skeptical that subsidence is largely concurrent with the mining activities, as stated in the DEIS. I believe the latency period between the extraction of the ore body and subsidence at the surface is long enough that the ore body will be completely removed long before the subsidence ceases. Therefore, although monitoring subsidence will be necessary, it will not provide timely information to prevent further subsidence if the real world results vary greatly from the modeled predictions and require intervention. Given the proximity of the Town of Superior, Top of the World, and the US 60; lack of comparable/observable mining efforts; and uncertainties in the model I do not believe the current mining method is acceptable to protect human health and safety."

Even northwest of Montana Mountain there will be a negative impact to scenic values as outlined in The Visual Contrast Rating Worksheet for Key Observation Point (KOP) 2 (Newell and Gramms 2018) The most negative im- pact on the AZNST will be along the three miles of ridge paralleling the tailings to the east (p. 502) just north of Forest Road 293 and approaching and dropping into Barnett Camp. Tailings to the west of the ridge will dominate the landscape. In figures for both Near West alternatives, 2.2.4-3 and 2.2.5-1, a Borrow Area east of the AZNST is shown. Although the DEIS states that Resolution will not use Borrow Areas outside of the TSF (p. 72), if the Borrow Area is used it will be visible for over a half mile along the ridge between elevations of 2689 ft. to 2772 ft. If a Near West alternative is selected for the TSF, the Borrow Area east of the AZNST should be removed from maps and from consideration. If the Borrow Area stays in Resolution Copper’s plans, there will be a degradation of scenic and noise values, as well as dust during construction and use of the material from the borrow area. At the north end of the ridge paralleling the TSF at Barnett Camp “0.07 mile of the proposed tailings pipeline corridor would intersect the Arizona Trail” (p. 503). At this location, since there will “substantial interference with the nature and purpose of the Arizona Trail, Resolution Copper is proposing substantial design features” (p. 504) However, there are no “substantial design features” that are shown in the DEIS that address the “substantial interference”. Resolution Copper would con- struct an “overpass” for the tailings pipeline corridor. The General Plan of Operations indicates that a pipeline bridge, called “overpass” in the DEIS, will be built to accommodate water and tailings pipelines (Figure 3.0-1h and 3.3-3a). Given the layout of the land where the pipeline bridge will enter the Barnett Camp area, its height could reach 250 ft. The height of the pipeline bridge/overpass would have a negative visual impact for both southbound and northbound trail users alike. Both the water and tailings slurry pipelines should have sound insulating materials in order to minimize any negative acoustics. The existing narrow dirt road at Barnett Camp would be widened to accommodate construction equipment and trucks. as well as users of the Tailings Facility of\ice/substation. Dust control measures need to be included in the expanded road during construction and mine operations. There will also be a 34.5-kV transmission line with 35’ transmission structures. Vegetation would be re- moved from a 150 corridor (Table 3.11.4-3, p. 601). For the tailings corridor infrastructure at Barnett Camp a visual resource analysis is recommended by SWCC to show the tailings corridor infrastructure (Newell and Grams KOP 5, 2018), although KOP 5 states that the bridge adds long term scenery impacts to the AZNST."

Further detail can be found in the Concentrate Pipeline Corridor Management Plan (M3 Engineering and Technology Corporation 2019b)” (p.498). However, the Plan says nothing about the AZNST, only that there will be a berm containment for the 2 concentrate pipelines, a water pipeline, and an Arizona Water Company pipe- line. There would be a road for the \irst 13 miles from the West Plant site (p.4 of Plan). Burial of pipelines would occur from mile 13 to the Filter Plant. The Plan indicates that the corridor will be fenced and where “road or trail crossings occur, fencing will be placed to allow personnel and or vehicle crossing” (p. 11 of Plan). For the AZNST crossing, would the crossing be safe for horses and appropriate for mountain bikers? The Final EIS must provide the details of the crossing in order to determine impacts to the ‘nature and purpose” of the AZNST. The Plan further states that the “MARRCO Corridor is private property and cannot legally be ac- cessed without noti\ication and permission” (p. 11 of Plan). The Record of Decision must incorpo- rate the granting of permission for users of the AZNST to cross the MARRCO Corridor."

How- ever, having the Filter Plant close to the West Plant could occur with any Alternative. If that hap- pens, there would be two 50-railcar trains twice a day carrying concentrate to the Skyline site. That means there would be four train trips, two in each direction. The MARRCO Corridor track would require upgrades along its entire length. There would also be a signi\icant upgrade for the AZNST crossing (p.84), but there are no details.

That ATA agrees with suggested mitigations to minimize impacts from new transmission line; to minimize exterior lighting in order to maintain Dark Skies; to utilize colors on structures that would blend in with desert colors; to control dust as much as is realistic (Appendix J). As mention in comments for Alternative 2 and 3 and Alternative 4, the ATA does not agree with RC-212, Relocation of the Arizona National Scenic Trail. For Alternatives 2 and 3, the reroute would not be appropriate. For Alternative 4, the reroute would stop within the north end of the TSF. For each alternative a compensatory mitigation is recommended by the ATA. If a reroute is mandatory a reroute over Gonzales Pass or through Superior using the LOST past the tunnel on US Hwy 60 then north and west up the cliffs meeting the AZNST somewhere close the Superstition Wilderness. Any reroute would need to safely accommodate all users of the AZNST. "

"NP03","NEPA: Purpose and Need","NP","NEPA Process","Section 1.3 Purpose and Need The Forest Service should expand the discussion of the importance of copper as a critical and strategic mineral. Copper is essential in electric wiring and transportation and plays a significant role in the development of energy resources, including wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicles. A single industrial-sized wind turbine requires more than two tons of copper;electric vehicles require more than four times as much copper as conventional gasoline vehicles. Copper has also been identified as an important strategic mineral and necessary for the national defense industry. Identifying and developing U.S. resources of copper, and other minerals, is an important objective of national mineral policy.1 [Footnote: For a general discussion and authority for this proposed discussion in the EIS see, for example, Minerals, Critical Minerals, and the U.S. Economy, National Academy of Sciences (2008). Theses issues were also discussed in a hearing before the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee on September 17, 2019. This information is also available on the AEMA website at https://www.miningamerica.org/about-mining/.] Approval of the Resolution project supports that purpose and need. Information about the need for and uses of copper provides important context for the consideration of the proposed mining plan of operations and for other approvals that may be required from the Forest Service or other agencies. While the Draft EIS provides important background on the history of Arizona’s Copper Triangle (for example, Figure 1.2-1) it fails to draw the link between the size and quality of the Resolution copper deposit, the need for copper to support the U.S. economy and the history and experience of the Copper Triangle. Simply put, additional copper mining is necessary to support the growing U.S. and world economies, the Resolution deposit is a significant resource that should be developed, and Arizona has the infrastructure, the history and the regulatory framework and experience for the mine to be developed with minimal environmental impacts."

The analytical model for the socioeconomic impacts—the “mining boom/bust cycle” referenced on page 640—is outdated. For a more contemporary example of a mining community, the Forest Service should look at growth and development in Elko, Nevada. The economy of northern Nevada is dominated by gold mining, and has been for almost forty years, similar to the anticipated life of the Resolution Mine. Elko has been named “The Best Small Town in America,” the best city to live in Nevada, and one of the best areas for outdoor recreation in the country. The area around Superior has similar resources, including outdoor recreation opportunities and nearby population centers. With the employment and income growth as a result of the land exchange and mine, Superior (and other nearby communities) could see the same type of longterm growth in quality of life and economic opportunity that has been seen in Elko and other modern mining communities. The final EIS should include a discussion of these potential opportunities and explain how other communities have benefited from large mining projects. The analysis should also include a discussion of the high level of education and skills and commensurate wage levels for workers in modern mining. According to the Arizona Mining Association website, mining jobs in Arizona pay an average wage of $102,859, more than twice that of all Arizona jobs. Modern mine workers include engineers, chemists, geologists, hydrologists, and other technical and professional specialties. "

To project manager’s credit, a quantitative assessment of these emissions is provided—thank you! Not unexpectedly in this era where fossil fuel still powers mining operations (extraction, transport, processing, etc.), given the proposed project’s size, these emissions are huge as indicated (pp 278-280 or nearby?): ""The proposed action would lead to emissions of greenhouse gases based largely on fuel use by mobile sources with a minor contribution from process combustion sources. The total greenhouse gas emissions would amount to 173,328 CO2 equivalent tonnes/year, based on year 14 with the highest emission rates. Project emissions would contribute to ongoing climatic trends."" Given that those “climatic trends” are such that in the last week 11,000 scientists joined together in an open letter (published in BioScience) and warned of a “climate emergency” if business as usual continues. The 173,000 + tons / year of GHG identified above represent an impact roughly the same as annual emissions from 8650 ordinary Americans (@ 20 tons / yr). So, a question for project managers, “Given the climate emergency we face, what steps will you take to mitigate the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project that you have quantitatively assessed?

If you plan these or other steps, please provide details.” I note that, purchasing ten years of carbon credits (say @ $2.87 per ton) at project outset project emissions would cost roughly $0.5 million / yr x 10 years = $5 million—whereas paying a future (and potentially escalating carbon tax of say average $50 per year would cost $50 million!

The FEIS should acknowledge that the size and scale of the deposit are important to the strategic and economic importance of the project. The Resolution project will provide significant and long-term economic benefit to Arizona and local communities and a significant and reliable strategic source of copper from our own backyard to supply our national security needs. The economic benefits disclosed in the DEIS are unlike any private investment in the state of Arizona today - thousands of jobs and tens of billions in economic benefits over decades. The impressive level of benefit from taxes, wages, and purchase of goods and services will bring a much needed and long lasting positive economic benefits to the local Copper Triangle communities, Pinal County, Maricopa County and the state. Luke Air Force base is in my district. Copper plays a critical role in the materials needed to build military aircraft to protect our nation and the men and women who serve in our armed forces. The Resolution project would provide a copper supply equal to 25% of our nation’s annual need. The Final EIS should incorporate a clear statement that describes the critical and strategic role copper plays in our national security. During my nine years in the Arizona State Legislature, I spent time on site touring the Resolution Copper Project and visiting with employees and contractors. I was impressed with the extremely high level of attention and focus on the health, safety and well-being of the workforce and surrounding communities. The commitment to environmental stewardship by restoring and reclaiming the historic Magma Mine, an impact that pre-dates Resolution Copper’s involvement, has been extraordinary. The degree of focus on hiring local and building the capacity of local contractors is impressive and directly benefits the local communities within the Copper Triangle of Arizona.

This is an integral part of Superior’s becoming a recreational destination and will help address the socioeconomic disequilibrium detected that the Resolution Project will cause for Superior and outdoor enthusiasts from all parts. Resolution Copper needs to certify in the Record of Decision that it will allow recreational access to the Queen Creek Canyon segment of the LOST trail (old Highway 60) including the historic Queen Creek tunnel in perpetuity. LOST requests that Resolution Copper fully fund the development of the Castleberry Ranch into a full-service campground as a mitigation for the loss of camping at Oak Flats. Ongoing maintenance for this should be funded by the endowment created to care for the RUG plan. We request that Resolution Copper either fund directly or through the RUG endowment, the extension of the LOST Queen Creek segment south across the base of Apache Leap.

Obviously each one has exceptions o Basic  Regionally produced good/ service sold to those from outside the region  These are larger purchases that work as imports and exports. The money is coming from outside but supporting the local government.  Examples of this are, hotels, tourist attractions, or in this specific case, the export of minerals from the mine State and Local Government Revenue • The mine is projected make over a million dollars a year in tax revenue alone. This is money that is being used to support the local government that came from somewhere else. This money supports multiple aspects of the government and things it is expected to support. The report provides a few examples of things it will support like the unified school district, the local Junior College and many over 30 million dollars to the State of Arizona Alone Increases in Pimal County • As discussed earlier, the mine will provide a large increase in tax revenue alone, but it will likely increase in other aspects as well. o Increased Population  While the profits from the mine will increase the tax revenue of the city, the new employees moving within the local area will increase the tax revenue as well. Some people see not hiring locally is all bad, but it’s really not. Not hiring locally brings people from out of the area and increases the population and therefore increases tax revenue as well.  As a population grows, the city will grow as well, gaining new amenities they may not have such as larger grocery and super stores.

"IA01","Issues Analysis: Proposed New Issue","IA","Issues Analysis","One issue regarding the impact of the proposed Rosemont mine that is noticeably absent from the published Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Resolution Copper Project and Land Exchange is the regular use of the Oak Flat Recreation Area as a teaching site for Arizona State University’s field biology courses. We, the instructors and students for these courses – I speak from the experience of having been both instructor and student at this location – regularly utilize this site for graduate and undergraduate field training and research projects. The area possesses a diverse assemblage of habitat patches, including cottonwood and sycamore dominated riparian areas, interspersed grass and wildflower dominated patches, sand-filled dry washes, rocky outcroppings, and seasonally-filled tanks of standing water in addition to the surrounding Emory oak/manzanita scrub matrix that is typical of the region. This patchy nature makes the local floral and faunal assemblages uniquely distinct from surrounding areas. Ease of access via a major road, proximity to a gas station in Superior, and a reasonable driving distance – being only an hour away from ASU campus – make this location the ideal site for teaching and learning about our local flora and fauna. In addition to the loss of historical and archaeological value of the area, the risk to local natural resources, and potential detrimental effects to the nearby town of Superior which have been cited in past, the proposed mine will wholly eliminate the biological and educational value of this locality, as these unique habitat patches will disappear forever. How does the Forest Service justify the loss of this educational land use value?"

I had the opportunity to travel to Oak Flat in February of this year and am including an excerpt of a follow up account I shared with family upon returning home, which clearly delineates the spiritual experience had by myself and everyone else present: Wendsler Nosie, the great leader and Chief of this particular community of Indigenous People, made sure to repeat, on multiple occasions, that we are all one. That we all pray to the same G-d/Creator/Spirit regardless of who we are or where we come from. He demonstrated a true love for humanity in his insistence that we pray for those who were seeking to destroy the land he and his family deem sacred. He told everyone present that we were his family regardless of our skin, or religion-that we were his brothers and sisters, and yoL1 could feel the authenticity in his words and see It in his eyes as he took the time to bless each and every person who was present. I will never forget last weekend's visit to Oak Flat and the time we spent together as a family bound by blood with our family bound by spirit. The Apache people are true role models in what it means to live one's life with reverence for our planet and our fellow humans. Their fight for Oak Flat Is not theirs a/one-it is everyone's. We are all affected by the repercussions of oppression and environmental degradation. As you can see, the Resolution Copper project and subsequent mining threatens the history and very existence of an entire culture. According to www.people.tamu.edu, the definition of culture is as follows: ""Culture refers to the cumulative deposit of knowledge, experience, beliefs, values, attitudes, meanings, hierarchies, religion, notions of time, roles, spatial relations, concepts of the universe, and material objects and possessions acquired by a group of people in the course of generations through individual and group striving."" With that definition in mind, I urge you to reconsider your actions, to place utmost importance on the cumulative values of a nation rather than the pockets of a select few. The time for change is now, and the opportunity to lead the way is in your hands. Our country, and our planet, are suffering at the hands of those who fail to consider the relationship between all lifewho fail to see the long term consequences of hastily implemented actions. To reconsider the insertion of a mega-mine at Oak Flat Is not only to provide the native people of that land the respect, care, and consideration they have always deserved yet rarely received but it would also create space for a much needed shift within all of humanity. it would allow the value of people and nature to rank higher than economy and Industry.

"3.9.03","Recreation: Mitigation","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","“Relocation of Arizona National Scenic Trail(RC-212)” Although The Forest Service is in the process of developing a solid mitigation plan in order to minimize, rectify, reduce or compensate for resource impacts, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods are still questionable in my personal opinion since many of them only depend on a few but not all alternatives such as the “Relocation of Arizona National Scenic Trail(RC-212)” where it is only applicable to alternatives 2, 3 and 4. In addition, this mitigation plan would cause more land disturbances. This raises many concerns for the public and the environment as it would be affecting this area permanently. This mitigation plan does not have a solid plan on where the relocation would be and how effective it could be. In my opinion if this mitigation plan was chosen assuming that alternative 2,3 or 4 were used, it would require an additional environmental impact analysis of that relocated area, it would have to have a better discussion on of the anticipated impacts and benefits of relocating the trail, what tree or animal species would be affected the most since Tonto National Park holds a wide variety of both endangered and non- endangered species. As many people mostly visit the place for the scenery and recreation, how much of an impact would this mitigation plan cause on the scenery of the surrounding area since it has not been identified yet?"

Which again raises the question on how much land is going to be disturbed and where exactly would it be? What are the species that would be affected the most? I suggest that this gets worked out and be available to the public in order to help them choose an alternative.

It also claims that this network would reduce the continued development of unauthorized trails which are negatively impacting the eco-system of the park as it would protect soil resources in the area form erosion. This plan also would also cause additional 66.5 acres of land disturbances and would be applicable to all alternatives. The good thing about this plan is that it actually has a design set in place, and it is already known that it would work with all alternatives. It could, in fact, increase the number of recreational tourists visiting the area as it would help form additional scenic trails which should not be affected by the pipelines since the pipelines are set to be buried.

Currently, there are about 17 established grazing allotments approximately 462,000 acres within the project area on lands managed either by the Forest Service, Burea of Land Management, or the Arizona State Land Department or on privately owned lands. One acre is approximately 69.57 yards or 208 feet, that just goes to show how much arable land will be lost during development and or nearing the end of the project. I noticed that all action alternatives would seriously affect vegetation and critical water sources and can cause direct or indirect impacts that would render divisions of the current grazing allotments unavailable for livestock grazing. Livestock grazing decreases the competition from nonnative plants so that other beneficial weeds and wildflowers can regenerate and coincide with one another. Many rare species of plants, require grazing to maintain their viable populations. Livestock grazing and long-term productivity would be permanently impacted within the tailings storage facility and subsidence area. The tailings would then seep into the land and disturb the clean and healthy soil, therefore, leading to stunted growth of grass and shrubbery. Grazing would be affected by a decline in the area available for grazing, and by impacts on seeps, springs, and nutrition tanks that are utilized by livestock. "

So many people from different backgrounds place enormous value in what this part of Tonto National Forest has to offer: scenic beauty, a chance to escape our busy lives, the opportunity to rock climb, camp, picnic, explore, etc. The public would lose all of this if the Resolution Mine is allowed to proceed with its plans. The Oak Flat area between Apache Leap and Devils Canyon is also an area of important religious and cultural significance to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, and allowing the Resolution Mine to proceed would further deny the Apache access to what was once their homeland: the Pinal Mountains.

Implementation of this plan will help in conservation efforts by supporting designated trail use and will combat the “social trail” damage. The RUG trail plan is a proposed mitigation in the EIS for the Resolution Copper project. The USFS should incorporate the RUG plan, as presented in Attachment 1 of Appendix J, in its entirely into the Record of Decision as a partial required mitigation for the combined recreational impacts of the Resolution Copper Project. The endowment should be managed by a local nonprofit organization led by the Legends of Superior Trails (LOST) with significant board participation by other RUG contributing organizations. It is contemplated that the LOST led operation would partner with the Arizona Community Foundation or similar organization. Since the proposed RUG trail system is being offered as an environmental offset to the Resolution Copper Project, owners BHP and Rio Tinto must be required to certify that it will remain as valued as an environmental offset. The property on which the RUG trail system is located must either be bonded for full value against mineral exploration involving drilling or other disruption and mineral exploitation or the mineral rights must be signed over to the Town of Superior.

However, the Forest Service, providing no details, dismisses less destructive alternatives entirely, suggesting they would be prohibitively expensive. Ignoring NEPA, it makes a decision serving the best financial interest of Resolution Copper and its parent company Rio Tinto. Both the draft EIS and the alternative selections are incomplete and certainly vulnerable to successful legal challenge. The Final Environmental Impact Statement must evaluate all mining technique alternatives suitable for the area and project and include a preferred alternative that protects the surface of Oak Flat, its sacred sites and its recreational potential for current and future generations; reduces water consumption; and minimizes the size of the tailings impoundment.

Those issues persist today. Colonel Barta kindly responded to my letter explaining that TNF was the lead agency for the preparation of an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and that jurisdictionally USACE was a cooperating agency if RCC applied for a permit to discharge dredged or fill material under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and it was determined that in fact such a permit would be necessary. Colonel Barta also explained that the Corps had recently received RCC's application for a permit for the Skunk Camp Alternative. Colonel Barta made clear that the Corps' role in the NHPA process is limited to those areas over which your agency has jurisdiction, i.e., areas for which a section 404 permit would be required such as the tailings storage facility (""TSF"") and associated pipelines. We understand this is USACE view of its limited role in this and greatly appreciate Colonel Barta's clear and succinct explanation of the Corps' position, although we do not necessarily agree. "

The Forest Service chose Alternative 6 as their preferred waste disposal alternative, but Alternative 6 involves a waste site located 20 miles from the mining operation. Alternative 6 would permanently cover 4000 acres of previously undisturbed land with tailings, impact approximately another 5000 acres of land along 20 to 30 miles for tailings management and transport purposes, and add a significant amount of heavy equipment transport along the most scenic portion of Highway 77. Also, because Alternative 6 was apparently chosen fairly recently, there are fewer years of biological survey data available than for other DEIS alternatives closer to the proposed mining site. This is clearly not an acceptable option for waste disposal based on the principle of avoiding and minimizing impacts. We oppose the selection of Alternative 6 as the preferred option. "

The DEIS indicates that actions possible by the USFS include not approving the proposed General Plan of Operation (GPO) for the mine, or selecting the ES-2.1 (No Action Alternative) and denying amendments to the Tonto Forest plan, allowing for activities related to the mine on USFS lands. This contradicts the earlier Notice of Intent (NOI) indicating that the No Action Alternative cannot be selected by the Forest Service – is this because of the 1872 Mining Law? Does the mining law supersede the mineral withdrawal of 1952? It is unclear if the land exchange passed by Congress supersedes the 1952 Presidential Order that withdrew a part of the Oak Flat area from mining.

"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Alternative Mining Methods Underground mining alternatives to block caving were eliminated from further consideration in the DEIS. These methods were eliminated from detailed consideration in the DEIS based largely on two factors, the cost of mining and the feasibility of large-scale tailings backfill. The DEIS identifies the environmental and social values that would be lost due to block caving, but does not give these factors the same weight as cost of mining and technical feasibility. As will be discussed, the preservation of environmental values (recreation, surface and groundwater loss) and social values (Native American heritage) should be given significant weight in the DEIS if it is reasonably possible to preserve these values. The mine will provide economic value to the region for 41 years, but the impacts due to subsidence will remain in perpetuity. A backfill-compatible underground mining method would allow preservation of environmental and social values predicted to be lost due to subsidence, would not sterilize part of the remaining mineral resource, would mine the ore body more efficiently, and would provide more jobs over a longer term to the local economy. The land exchange is contingent upon: “(2) approval of the ‘‘General Plan of Operations’’ (GPO) for any operations on National Forest System (NFS) land associated with a proposed large-scale underground mine (Resolution Copper Project) (DIES 2019) To the lay reader the statement suggests that the US Forest Service is not obligated to approve the GPO because of the land trade, but must still evaluate the GPO in line with its general permitting obligations for a large mine GPO. It does not say, for example, that because Congress has authorized a land trade, that the GPO must be approved even if it means the destruction of resources the US Forest Service would normally be obligated to protect. The US Forest Service is still obligated to evaluate the protection of existing uses and resources, including environmental and social values, as a part of its approval of a GPO. The US Forest Service is already proposing significant, and sound, changes to the company’s proposed plan of operation, including relocation of the tailings facilities, and construction of centerline/downstream dams instead of upstream dams as proposed by the Resolution Copper. A similar shift to an underground mining technique that would prevent surface subsidence would be similarly sound, for reasons that will be discussed. "
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Ore Resource The analysis for the underground mining alternatives in the DEIS was based largely on a report commissioned by SWCA, the third party contractor to the US Forest Service for the DEIS, and written by Charles A. Kliche, P.E., PhD, in November, 2017. The Kliche report identifies a number of significant facts about the proposed mine, including: • An indicated plus inferred resource of 1.969 billion short tons containing 1.54 percent copper and 0.035 percent molybdenum at depths 5,000 to 7,000 ft below the surface, with 1.538 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.99% copper. • Approximately 2.02 billion tonnes of ore reserves grading 0.86% copper lying at about 350 metres below the existing undercut level of the mine. • A loss of 12 to 15% of the ore due to the block caving method. Resource Sterilization Since the draw angle is relatively steep in the Resolution ore body (cave angles of 70 to 78 degrees – DIES 2019), then in addition to the 12 to 15% of the ore that will be lost due to dilution in block caving, after mining at proposed levels has ceased, any ore located in the same horizontal horizon will also likely be lost to future mining. The ore located below the existing mining levels would still be accessible. Ore Grade Dr Kliche had to work without any data support from Resolution Copper. He noted that his estimate was: “based on limited information provided by RCM, of the total tons of potentially mineable material above a cut-off grade of 2% which lies at or above the -2,500 ft level.” (Kliche 2017, emphasis added) Dr Kliche also noted some data was taken from a report produced for Resolution Copper, Geologic and Mineral Resource Model - Suitability for Declaration of Mineral Resources and Support for Mine Plans to Develop a Block or Panel Cave Mine, Letter prepared exclusively for Resolution Copper Mining (RCM), by Harry M. Parker, Amec Foster Wheeler E&C Services Inc., March 14, 2017, which was not made available in the DEIS support documents. It too might provide more information on Resolution Copper’s predicted production costs, but it is evidently not available for public review. Dr Kliche notes in his introductory remarks that this is a “relatively low grade … resource”. (Kliche 2017). This view underlies his mining cost analysis. But, this is not a low grade copper resource. In fact, Resolution Copper itself has called the deposit “large, high-grade, hypogene copper-molybdenum deposit” (Hehnke et al 2012, emphasis added) Figure 9, from Mudd et. al. (2012), document that the average copper grade worldwide is decreasing with time, and in 2012 was approximately 0.5 – 0.7% Cu. The Resolution deposit is roughly three times this grade level. Mudd et. al. (2012) rate Resolution as the 16th largest deposit of contained copper in the world, and the second largest in the US, behind the Pebble deposit. However, this is based only on the proposed mine. If the 2 billion tons of ore below existing deposit were included, Resolution would probably rise to the number seven position worldwide. The proposed Pebble mine also plans to have an underground mine, at a similar depth to Resolution and utilizing block caving, but its deep ore grade is closer to 0.6% Cu equivalent. This suggests mining Resolution with block caving should be very lucrative. Figure 3: Grade and tonnage characteristics of the Resolution deposit compared to other porphyry-type deposits world-wide, copper (top), molybdenum (bottom). Selected, noteworthy deposits are labeled. The dashed diagonal lines represent the total contained metal. Modified from Seal (2012) and Sinclair (2007). A similar grade analysis to that of Mudd et. al. can be seen in, Figure 3, from Kloppenburg (2017), showing Resolution to be one of the highest grade copper porphyry deposits in the world."
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Mining Cost and Production Capacity SWCA has used Dundee Capital Markets, 2012, An Introduction to Underground Mining to bracket underground mining cost estimates (DEIS 2019). SWCA also estimated that all of the underground mining methods evaluated, except block caving, could accommodate backfilling which could prevent subsidence. All the underground mining methods costs, with the exception of cut-and-fill mining, were the same cost to approximately twice the cost of block caving (SWCA 2017). This cost range is not unreasonable to evaluate further as viable alternatives, given the uses and resources that could be saved by eliminating subsidence. Production volume for dry tailings for underground backfill was also a consideration, and was used as a discriminating factor for mining method evaluation in the DEIS alternatives screening. It was noted that “The process of using dry stack tailings methods has not been done at the scale of the proposed GPO production scale (130,000 tons per day). The industry maximum of successful dry stack production is 20,000 tons per day.” (DEIS 2019). However, it should also be noted that the US Forest Service recently approved dry stack tailings at the Rosemont Mine at a production rate of 75,000 tons per day. Since only approximately half of the tailings are typically backfilled in an underground mine, the dry tailings production rate approved at Rosemont would be virtually identical to the rate needed for backfill at Resolution. Dry tailings/backfill production rate should not be a barrier to underground mining at Resolution. "
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Subsidence Mining is predicted to result in a “Large, visible crater with cave angles of 70 to 78 degrees and with a depth between approximately 800 and 1,115 feet at the end of mine life ... the fracture limit is estimated to extend to within approximately 1,115 feet (340 m) from Apache Leap, and to approximately 3,445 feet (1,050 m) from Devil’s Canyon. The fracture limit area is roughly 1.8 miles in diameter.” (DEIS 2019). Figure 16 (DEIS 2019) Predicted crater (blue) and fracture limits (black) at the end of mine life. It should be noted that if the subsidence angle turns out to be less than the 70 to 78 degrees predicted, especially after mining ceases, the fracture zone shown in Figure 16 (DEIS 2019) would move closer to Apache Leap. Any mining of a deeper resource, if done by block caving, the only method considered by Resolution Copper, the fracture zone would likely also widen. As a result, a significant part of the deeper resource would need to be sterilized to protect Apache Leap. With underground backfill this significant part of the resource could be mined. Underground mining with backfill was inappropriately eliminated from consideration as an alternative because the impacts that could be avoided were not given proper consideration. In addition, the Forest Service expert undervalued the orebody, and dry tailings for backfill is technically feasible as the Forest Service approval of Rosemont clearly demonstrates. "
"ALT4","New Alternative (Skunk Camp)","ALT","Alternatives",
"ALT4","New Alternative (Skunk Camp)","ALT","Alternatives","Tailings Facility – Embankment Type The Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option, would require a centerline sand dam for the NPAG tailings, and downstream sand dam construction for PAG tailings. The NPAG embankment would contain an underdrain system comprising sand and gravel blanket and finger drains (primarily along main drainages, with some extended beneath the NPAG beach) to maintain a low saturated surface in the tailings embankment and to intercept and direct seepage from the impoundment. The PAG cells would be behind (upstream) and ultimately covered by the NPAG tailings. Construction Type This is a significantly safer approach to tailings disposal than the upstream dam with mixed NPAG and PAG tailings proposed by Resolution Copper. Centerline/downstream-type construction is much safer in terms of both potential static and seismic failures than upstream construction. Wet versus Dry Closure Dry closure is considered safer than wet closure, because with a wet closure where containment is lost the tailings usually flush from the breach and travel downgradient with considerable force and for a great distance. In the case of wet PAG tailings, if containment is lost then oxidation of this material can be rapid and widespread. The closure scheme proposed for Alternative 6 – Skunk Camp would have a drain system under the NPAG tailings that could be utilized to keep these tailings largely unsaturated. Although the ideal dry closure would be with dry tailings, drained tailings is the next best choice. And, although the two PAG impoundments would be wet, they are also totally contained behind and buried by the NPAG tailings. This provides an additional physical barrier to release in the event of a structural failure. Breach Analysis A breach analysis shows how far tailings could be released under several scenarios, including normal operating conditions, and during/after a severe storm event. A breach analysis for the Resolution alternatives has yet to be completed. A breach analysis could/should have been done for the Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option. This is not a difficult analysis. Seismic Risk Use of the 1:10,000 year return period earthquake as the design earthquake for the tailings dams, as is done for the Preferred Alternative, is the appropriate choice for the design event. Too many agencies use a lesser earthquake as the design event for a structure that is meant to function in perpetuity, so it is good to see the US Forest Service require the appropriate design earthquake. The seismic analysis for the EIS is largely based on a report by Wong et. al (2013). The Wong et. al (2013) report was focused on analyzing four specific sites that were under consideration at that time: the Far West Tailings Management Area: Far West 1 and Far West 2; the Near West Tailings Management Area; and, the Pinto Valley Operations (PVO) Tailings Management Area. The Proposed Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) was not analyzed in this report. The Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option, would occupy the upper portion of Dripping Spring Valley, the northeastern slopes and foothills of the Dripping Spring Mountains, and the southwestern foothills of the Pinal Mountains, including a 4-mile reach of Dripping Spring Wash, a 3.5-mile reach of Stone Cabin Wash, and a 4.8-mile reach of Skunk Camp Wash. Cornwall, Banks, and Phillips (1971), map an extensive fault structure running the length of Dripping Spring Wash. This fault is not mentioned in the Wong et al (2013) report or the DEIS (2019). This fault most probably bisects the dams and impoundments, so should merit further investigation and discussion in the DEIS. The DEIS does not specify the location of the 1:10,000 year event, or the assumed magnitude of this event. In the Wong et al report (2013) it is noted that the values calculated for the PGA are ""significantly lower"" than the values from the USGS Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA) and (USGS 2008). The USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps are typically used to develop the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA) for a mine location. The US Forest Service should require the use of the most conservative estimates for seismic events because of the extremely long time period for which tailings facilities are planned to function. In addition, the USGS has updated its National Seismic Hazard Maps (2014) since the Wong et. al. report (2013) was written. At a minimum the seismic study needs to be updated to reflect current information, and to include an analysis of the Preferred Alternative site, which was not included in the 2013 report. The EIS must use up to date information, make conservative assumptions about the size and location of the maximum credible earthquake, and must disclose the location and magnitude of the maximum credible earthquake used for the design earthquake for the tailings dam. Alternative 6 Tailings Pipeline – North Option The tailings pipeline for the Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option, will run along and across several faults in the route. There is no seismic risk for the tailings pipeline in the DEIS or in the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (KCB 2019). Tailings pipeline failure during an earthquake should have been considered in the DEIS and FMEA. In addition, tailings pipeline failures are common events at large copper mines (Gestring 2019), and should have been addressed in the FMEA."

Although NEPA does not define “the human environment” it is clear that it is more than, but includes, the natural environment. NEPA directly addresses economic considerations a number of times, so it can be argued that economic considerations, which are clearly addressed in most EISs in the context of jobs, taxes, and community impacts. If a financial surety is required by law, which is required in Arizona, the EIS should also consider the potential economic impacts on the mining company of obtaining a financial surety for closure and/or a catastrophic failure, as well as the potential impacts to the public should the financial surety be absent, or inadequate. A financial surety for mine closure, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance, today typically runs in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. If perpetual water treatment is required, then the financial surety required typically doubles. If a company goes bankrupt during or after mining, the financial surety must be adequate to close the mine and perform post-closure monitoring and maintenance. If the financial surety is not adequate, then the public must either provide this money, or suffer the environmental damage associated with leaving the mine in its then-existing state. It is not atypical that hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake with a closure financial surety. This is clearly a potential impact on the economic and/or natural human environment, and should be disclosed/evaluated in a project EIS, as National Environmental Policy Act (42 USC § 4332) dictates. However, in the DEIS (2019) it is stated: “The cost estimates for the reclamation financial assurances are based on the final design of the facility, would be developed after the NEPA process, and would not be finalized until the final GPO is approved.” This is a failure to analyze a very significant potential impact to the public. In addition, it also means the public will have limited, or no, opportunity to comment on the size or adequacy of the financial surety. "

"MIT02","Mitigation: Proposed New Mitigation","MIT","Mitigation","The land exchange does not fully compensate the public for lands and waters loss to wildlife habitat and for recreational purposes. It is the policy of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission (A.1.9.) that AGFD shall seek compensation at a l00% level, when feasible, for actual or potential habitat losses resulting from land and water projects. The current preferred alternative will result in permanent loss or significant degradation of 13 square miles of Resource Category III habitat. The AGFD mitigation goal is no net loss of this habitat value. We anticipate net loss of up to 13 acres from the tailings storage facility alone. The AGFD's Habitat Compensation Policy (I.2.) is to recommend that anticipated losses be compensated by replacement of habitat values in-kind, or by substitution of high value habitat types, or by increased management of replacement habitats, so that no net loss occurs. AGFD supports a proposal consisting of 2,600 acres of Category 1 habitat

Enough that we can stop mining, fracking, and stripping our earth for resources. The truth is, there is no enough. Please do not misunderstand, I am not speaking of developing countries which need resources to build hospitals, schools, and safe, comfortable housing. I am referring specifically to the United States and Tonto National Forest. This is not an argument of whether the land is put to better use as a copper mine. This is a sign that we are growing desperate. That we may give up previously protected land is a sign that we must not. What will come next? After Oak Flat, where will we turn when next our demand for raw material has exhausted the current sources? Will we go to California and chop down the redwoods? I ask because, as unthinkable as it is if we do not value our land as we always have; we will destroy it all, and we will destroy ourselves. We are a part of this world, as much as the narrow-headed garter snake, Arizona hedgehog cactus, and yellow-billed cuckoo. If we allow their habitat in Oak Flat to be destroyed, we are destroying our home too. That is too high a price to be paid. We stand on the brink of causing our earth's irrevocable destruction. The choices that we make, right here, right now, will have consequences for centuries to come. What we do, and what we do not, carries the weight of our future and our survival. We cannot afford to accept this burden lightly. We cannot afford to think in terms of short term gain or loss. We must think of the future. We must remember what it is that we are protecting and why. We must remember that, while the earth has survived meteors and mass extinction, our lives and the lives of every living thing on the planet, are far more fragile.

Everyday, there's news about new catastrophes climate change is having already in our planet. From oil spills in the oceans, to the Plastic Island travelling the oceans, from the destruction of the coral reefs, to the contamination of our rivers, it is undeniable to say that our actions are not the direct cause of the destruction of our environment. Day after day, I think to myself: What future beholds us if we continue down this path? What kind of planet are we leaving for our children, for the future generations? And then, I think, of the present, of the current struggles against projects that will decimate our lands, of my indigenous relatives all over Turtle Island and Abya Yala. Indigenous peoples from all over this continent have resisted and fought for the protection of the lands for over 500 years, and they continue to do so. From Mauna Kea to South Dakota, to the North in Canada to the South in Ecuador, indigenous peoples continue to suffer and die for their lands and the future of our mother Earth, our home. All those pipelines and mines and other megaproyects that continue to be constructed are for what? For progress? In the name of progress and science, we have been taught that stealing land and breaking treaties are progress. What is happening in Oakflat is no different. It might be said that the environmental impacts is not ""much"" or the adverse effects to sacred land is not high. But lemme ask you this: If we continue to put OUR future, the future of OUR children, in the hands of megacompanies who only care for profit, what will happen, relatives? I urge you to think about this, to think about the future. In your hands, you have the power to decide for the safety of everyone's future, their access to continue honoring sacred land and clean water. Is our future not valuable to you?

The worlds drinkable water resources are coming more scarce by the day, and if you purposely waste them no one will have pity when you are in need of clean water. This doesn’t affect just the land.

The river will run clear, and over it birdsong like a canopy. On levels of the hills will be green meadows, stock bells in noon shade...........” If, and only if we have the courage to stand firm against greed and in the glory and wisdom of our hearts will we preserve this dear land of ours with which we have been entrusted.

Do it out of fear of what happens if they refuse. Swimming with dolphins isn't fun. Extremely stressful for them, leads to them catching diseases. Only viewed as tools for profit. Other apes, monkeys, and horses used on cards aren't smiling because they're happy. Other apes and monkeys do what's called a ""fear grimace"", while horses smile in submission. They're not happy, they're abused. Cats, dogs specifically bred over 1000s years to live with humans. Other animals weren't. Kidnapped, locked up in tiny cages for human amusement. It's disgusting.

They'll show you how full of love life is. Save their life, and they'll save yours. It's not euthanasia. Not done for their benefit. It's murder. Imagine outrage if humans weren't being adopted were killed. No different for other animals. Other animals don't have ""vets"". They have doctors, and health and medical care, just like humans. There's no distinction. Be outrage if different humans had different doctors and terms depending on race. No different for other animals. That's speciesism. Caring for other animals isn't a chore, it's a duty and privilege. Don't say ""in the doghouse"" like some bad place to be, ok for dogs, but not humans. That's vile. Dogs belong in normal house, with their families. Species is irrelevant to family. Experiments are evil. How dare you cause such immense suffering and murder. You're birthing them to torture them. What a miserable existence. That constant, unending torture is unimaginable for most people. Fireworks and other explosions are horrible. Other animals, like cats, dogs, and birds, get absolutely terrified by fireworks. Causing such intense, unending fear is unjustifiable.

Oak Flat is an incredibly special place that is dear to many, many Americans. The natural beauty and resources stand in stark contrast to much of the surrounding landscape which has been the site of multiple mining operations for many decades. This contrast, and the exceptional recreational opportunities led then-President Eisenhower to declare the area a special resource to be held as Public Land for the recreational enjoyment of all Americans. There is a plaque at Oak Flat memorializing that declaration which serves as reminder that we recognize the inherent value in natural areas and we work to preserve them as part of our American heritage that we care for and steward for future generations. We need to honor the promise that one of our great American presidents made to all of us and preserve this land for the enjoyment of us all. I implore you to consider the following points and reject this proposal. Mining has had a long history in Arizona and is responsible for much economic development within my state and much of the USA, but now is the time to embrace the technology of the present and future, not the past. We have already mined so much Copper and other metals that we need to embrace a Materials Management framework and re-use existing resources rather than dispose of them in landfills after a single use. If we developed a deposit or buy-back system for our natural resources we would not need to approve most new mines such as this one.

Additionally, the amount of water required to operate this proposed mine is unsustainable and would pollute drinking water across the region. This area has been an important haven for centuries and should remain protected and preserved for generations to come."

While Congress has already directed the U.S. Forest Service to complete the land exchange contemplated by Section 3003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (NDAA), the Tonto National Forest Supervisor has discretion to ensure the transfer of federal and nonfederal lands meets all regulatory requirements, and to ensure all proposed mitigation measures are appropriately disclosed and analyzed. We are, therefore, pleased to see that: • The Apache Leap Special Management Area outside of the project footprint has been completed and Resolution Copper has incorporated additional land into the area for protection. • A plan outside of the project footprint on land administered by the Tonto National Forest for replacement and enhancement of recreational opportunities has been incorporated as a mitigation measure. his measure, termed “RC-214 Recreational Users Group and Superior Trails Network Plan,” will further drive local economic diversification within Pinal County, the Town of Superior, and other surrounding copper triangle communities. • An offset to the loss of bouldering at Oak Flat has been found, called the “Inconceivables,” as RC-213. This area is located between the Town of Superior and the Town of Kearny, and similar to RC-214, it would drive local economic diversification and tourism. • A new campground to replace the Oak Flat campground, called “Castleberry” (RC-215), has been proposed, which is located between the Town of Superior and Boyce Thompson Arboretum."

I felt the strength and power of the blessings shared, and the strength people gained from their faith - faith that has kept the Apache people strong through generations of persecution. I am of the Christian faith and my worship takes place in a church - the Apaches' sacred holy ground - their church - is Oak Flat. Allowing the mine project at Oak Flat would result in the destruction of sacred, holy ground and the desecration of worship, prayer, and ceremony space.

Water is life. It's clear that one reason Oak Flat is a Sacred Site is because it is an oasis of water, food and shelter in a vast desert landscape. It is a refuge for wildlife, and a ceremonial ground; a source of traditional knowledge, religion, sustenance, and biological diversity. All these values are self-perpetuating, and beyond monetization, but would be lost forever if converted to resources for one-time export. Oak Flat is a center for community gatherings, public education and outreach, and the symbol of a cause: the right to Religious Freedom for Indigenous People, who by protecting their Sacred Site also protect an endangered ecosystem and the knowledge of how to live in a sustainable manner for the sake of future generations. "
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive"," I am gravely concerned for the future of sacred Oak Flat and am writing to ask that all mining operations be permanently halted and disbanded in the area. I have traveled to Oak Flat on a number of occasions with friends and family to learn about the importance of its unique ecosystem, and lend my support as an ally to the Apache people for whom this site is sacred and vital to their ceremonial and cultural heritage. Amongst a vast landscape of desert and the slaughtered hillsides of now defunct mines in the area, Oak Flat is a sanctuary of as of yet uncontaminated water, large trees, and expansive vistas. For the indigenous people of the area this land holds generational history and, as with any temple or church of worship, provides direct access to the sacred beings of their religion. I have witnessed religious ceremonies directly tied into the land of Oak Flat, and view the proposed mining of the area as a direct attack on the native peoples' right to practice freedom of religion. In my various visits to Oak Flat I have seen the area be used as a community ""hall"" of sorts hosting large gatherings for people to eat together, discuss issues of political and social import with one another, and sing and dance together at live performances put on under the night sky. I have seen children exploring in the water together while elder generations tend to fires and meals. I have seen Oak Flat become the site of ceremonial dances and sweat lodges, as well as camping grounds for travelers interested in taking in the beauty of the area. In its natural state Oak Flat provides multifaceted positive uses to the indigenous people of the area as well as the surrounding population. To sell off this land to a foreign company to be destroyed and pillaged for a limited amount of resources that will be exported out of the area is quite simply appalling and unacceptable. The United States has a long history of taking land from, and genocidal tendencies toward, the indigenous peoples of America. It is a history that is only as of recently beginning to be acknowledged amongst the general population as a wrongdoing that deserves recognition and firm policies in place to prevent further damages. We must stop taking and destroying land at the expense of native peoples' rights to cultural preservation, religious freedom, health and livelihoods. The occupation of and destruction of Oak Flat by Resolution Mining will do just that. It must stop. Thank you kindly for your consideration of these comments and prompt action to protect sacred Oak Flat."
"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","I have rock climbed on public lands in the Queen Creek/Oak Flat area to the east of Superior, Arizona since 1985. This beautiful area is regularly visited by many hundreds of climbers each year and has been since at least the 1970s. These visitors spend money in the local communities and enjoy their right to use these federal lands for recreational purposes. The proposed mining plan in Oak Flat calls for what I believe is the largest destruction of recreational climbing resources in the history of America's public lands. It would be impossible to mitigate this loss. It is my understanding that if the mine as proposed were to come to fruition, it would destroy the Chi'chil Bildagoteel Historic District at Oak Flat, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places for its cultural and religious significance to the San Carlos Apache tribe. If I am correct, the destruction of this district is unacceptable as this is an irreplaceable resource that is significant to all Americans. It is imperative that all Americans have a say in what is proposed to happen on their public lands. All mining operations cause irreparable harm and need to be completely and totally investigated before any ground is broken. Complete and accurate Environmental Impact Statements (EISs), full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other laws is paramount to correctly deciding what should be allowed on public lands. I urge the Forest Service to completely and thoroughly review what studies have been done and determine what else needs to be done so that Americans can intelligently decide the best course of action at Oak Flat. That said, the destruction of the historic district and climbing resources should be enough to put an end to the proposed mine as both resources are irreplaceable.

There is a rational expectation that Town costs would be highly correlated with new permanent residents. No evidence was presented that show employees who do not work or live in the Town of Superior would cause Town services to rise so dramatically. • The DEIS also reports that “Resolution Copper has entered into an agreement with the Town of Superior to provide $1.65 million to support the Town’s emergency response services over the period from 2016 to 2021, and other agreements to fund amenities and education.” However, the dollar amount is not included in the comparison of costs and benefits.

Yet the report estimates 450 new households over the long term, exceeding the current available housing stock in the Town. Also, previous mine openings have shown that new commercial development will be induced from mine operations, such as commercial suppliers and hospitality.

I proudly voted for H.R. 3979, the Carl Levin and Howard P. “Buck” McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. This legislation authorized the land exchange for this Project in Section 3003, Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation, and I look forward to seeing its implementation. As documented in the DEIS, the Resolution Project will provide thousands of high paying jobs and important economic benefits to communities in the Copper Triangle, Maricopa County, Pinal County, Gila County, and State of Arizona of approximately $1 billion annually for decades. I am also encouraged by the the ongoing constructive relationship between the Town of Superior and Resolution Copper stakeholders, and I look forward to seeing this continue. As a co-sponsor of H.R. 2531, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, I want to emphasize how important it is that the Project will provide substantial supplies of copper - up to 25% of U.S. copper demand for over 40 years. It will also supply other metals that are necessary for our national defense, economic growth and energy security"

When mentioning it to my peers, parents and friends, they admitted they had heard nothing about the project either. The lack of public awareness of the Resolution Copper Mine is a violation of the NEPA process; flyers in public gathering spaces, emails, letters, and social media promotion could have all been used to share where to find additional information on the project as swell as dates of public comment hearings and online comment periods.

On page 81 of the EIS, it stated that filtered tailings would be used at Silver King in response to issues concerning human health and well-being. I think filtered tailings is a wonderful alternative and perhaps it could be integrated into some of the other alternatives. I’m still unclear as to why it was only chosen for one of the alternatives.

"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Water - While many people raised points about the project’s damaging effects on streams, water quality, etc., we don’t think there was enough concern expressed about the availability of this much water in the first place. In an article in the Oct 12,2019 edition of the Arizona Republic, Arizona Department of Water Resources Director Tom Buschatzke presented updated findings at a legislative committee meeting in Casa Grande focusing on Pinal’s groundwater situation. ""Looking out 100 years, there is insufficient groundwater in the Pinal active management area to support all existing uses and issued assured water supply determinations,"" Buschatzke said. He said the model estimated the total projected demand for water for 100 years. The estimated amount of water available is less than that by about 10%, or 8.1 million acre-feet. Page 328 of the draft EIS indicates that “Approximately one-half of Resolution Copper’s water needs will be sourced from long-term storage credits (surface stored underground)”. Are these credits part of a tradeoff with Pinal County farmers? Is this project adding yet another straw into an already overtaxed groundwater system, one whose groundwater withdrawals are already slated to increase from those same farmers as early as next year as part of the Drought Contingency Plan? We deserve serious, documented answers, not further shell-game tactics on the part of large-scale water users who would rather kick the can down the road. "
"3.6.04","Air Quality: Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions","3.6","Section 3.6 - Air Quality","I was surprised that there wasn’t any mention of climate change within the report. Based on my research, copper mining is a significant contributor to climate change both indirectly and directly. The direct effects of climate change include the generation of Co2 emissions from the copper production operation. The indirect contributors include trucks that are needed to transport the copper product, electricity used for refining and smelting, etc (Ruttinger 2016). Energy consumption of mining is substantial. “In Australia, mining is the fourth largest consumer of energy and recorded the largest energy consumption growth rate over a 3-decade period between 1980-81 and 2012-13” (Stanwix et al. 2015). Additionally, it has been noted that areas recognized for intensive mining experience extreme weather patterns consisting of extensive droughts, floods and cyclones. All of these extreme weather patterns were contributed to the effects of mining in those regions which led to a greater number of mining companies collaborating to create best practices. Copper mines are beginning to recognize their own vulnerability due to climate change and alter practices with a goal to mine extensively, not intensively. Perhaps the impact of copper mining on climate change needs to be addressed and examined, creating mitigation strategies to offset detrimental effects. Citations Ruttinger, L., & Sharma, V. (2016).

Beyond availability lies the issue of peak-demand prioritization - during the summer, the entire western Intertie is stressed on a daily basis (that stress only increases as our temperatures rise), and we think you need to press SRP to commit to prioritizing supplying the power needs of households, hospitals, etc., rather than this project, if demand-related cutbacks are needed during peak summertime usage."

Moreover, because of these risks, mining companies are working tirelessly to replace workers with robots. These jobs will not last.

My grandfather's side, I'm from where the old bridge goes over the river, the Colorado River. My grandparents are Bitterwater, the Colorado people. My grandfather is from Cow Springs. I've lived here in San Carlos since 1991. My children are Navajo and Apache. And my husband is Wendsler Nosie, Sr. Every time we went through to The Valley, we would say a prayer at Oak Flat or acknowledge those that lived there when we go by. Or we would stop there. We've picked acorns there and the red berries for the sunrise dances for our daughters and our granddaughters. Our granddaughter, Nizhoni had her sunrise dance there at Oak Flat. Nizhoni decided to have her dance at Oak Flat because she had a connection there. When she was growing up, her mom would stop through there and say their prayers when they came to San Carlos, when they came to visit. They always did that. And so, she had a connection there and wanted to have her sunrise dance there. She planned that's where it would be. We went there and decided where her camp would be and where her godparents would be. And over the year before her dance began, how she would gather those things needed for her coming of age ceremony from Oak Flat. And the one unique thing about Oak Flat was that you could go there and you could have the ceremony without erecting an elaborate camp like we have to do here. Nature was its own divider, It was much easier. The trees that were there and the way the spring divided the camp and the area in the middle where we would have the dance was already there. It was natural. And so, when she was having her dance, she was excited about it. We talked about the area. When someone has their dance, they have to be ready. They have to know as they're growing up the different things they need to know as women. She would have to pick what she wanted to be on her buckskin, what would be her representation. And those things that she loves about Oak Flat were the butterflies and the hummingbird and so in her emblems on her buckskin, those were where those representations of nature were on her own dress. After her dance was over, she would have to be washed of all the ashes. So, we took her to the spring there and as we took her to the spring, all the butterflies came to meet her. We were going up toward the spring and there were groups of butterflies, black monarchs and yellow ones. They followed us all the way there. It was very special. And during her dance, there were times when the hummingbirds actually came to the ceremony to where she was. Those things are very important to her and to me as a grandmother. Coming of age there is always going to hold reverence in her life and her kid's lives and her grandchildren's lives, the same it does with me. That area is connected to her and is connected to me through life, through practices, through ceremony, through prayers. If you're going to go to the church to pray, whether it may be something that is an obstacle in your life or something that's helping happening with your families' health, many people go to their church and they pray to have that connection with God to ask for those things. Oak Flat is like that. When we go through there, we pray, we thank the Creator for all those things he has given us. And at Oak Flat it's a place where if you were born there, yt,u could live th~re from what's there on the land. You would be able to eat from the food that's there. You could live there your entire life without worrying about those things that aren't natural that you need. So, it's a place that's important. If I was a Catholic or some other religion, I would go where God's presence is. Same thing here. When we go to Oak Flat, that's the presence and where that portal is where we can speak to the Creator for those things that we need or the blessings that we need and give thanks for what we have had or we have experienced. There's so much that's happening now. I have grandchildren who want to have their dances there. I want them to have a connection to the place, from what is expected in the future from the mine, that won't be there anymore. My granddaughter who had her dance there won't be able to take her daughters there. The children who are going there now and want to have their ceremonies there, are looking forward to that, it won't be possible because it won't be there. It just won't be there. It will absolutely be gone. It's not like they'll be able to go somewhere else and have that same connection with an area. That is very important to them. They can't just substitute another place for their ceremony. It's not possible to just pick somewhere else. The connection that you build in a lifetime is the connection that connects you to where you want to be. Just like women who make a decision to do something, like to have a dance or become a woman, you have to be ready and you have to know where you're supposed to me and not having that as an option is detrimental and will be detrimental for all my grandchildren coming up. Even the boys who have learned their songs there and learned about being men and how you conduct yourself. That is a place where, to them, that is the connection. A lot of different religions and different ways that people worship or people have their connection with God just have it out of a book or just have it out of one of a thousand churches they could go. It's not the same as with being Native. With being Native, developing the person that you are and making the right and wrong decision, having connections to the places that are with you, that you know about and have history with your family, with the people who came before you.

According to the DEIS, “Soil losses within the project footprint are, therefore, treated as permanent unless (1) soils are salvaged and reapplied during the construction and reclamation processes, (2) revegetation efforts successfully stabilize soils and reduce long-term erosion, and (3) soil productivity is returned to pre-mine conditions” (p. 164). The tailings produced by the mining process, as well as use of chemicals in the development of the site and processing of minerals, can be incredibly toxic and can easily be deposited in the soil through accidents or human negligence. If soils are salvaged and reapplied during the construction and reclamation processes, as the document claims may happen in order to ensure soil losses are not permanent, contaminated soils can be re-inserted into the natural environment. This can lead to massive disruption of food chains and ecosystem services, as vegetation that grows in this soil may have traces of chemicals present; animals that eat these plants will then also be exposed to the chemicals, and biomagnification will occur.

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","I think it goes without saying that the continued push for the Oak Flat Mining project by RCM flies directly in the face of public opposition. Since before 2015, hundreds of thousands of people have voiced opposition to the planned mine, including residents, recreational enthusiasts and Native American tribes that hold history in these lands. Each group brings up a separate yet compelling point that leads to the same request: stop the Oak Flat mining project. Native American groups, whose heritage and religion have been trampled untold times in the past by blind industry, are begging to be heard by representatives. This land was set aside in 1955 by Eisenhower as a measure of good faith to Native Americans that had not been listened to since the time of Jamestown. It amazes me that there are legal routes by which the US can take away this land once again, and hand it over to a foreign private industry. Residents both in and around the immediately affected area are voicing their concerns for water safety and overuse. Water acidification, accelerated erosion and heavy metal runoff into the water table and surrounding watershed pose a direct threat to the livelihood of Native Americans and US citizens. That's not to mention the undeniable impact that an industrial copper mine has on wildlife, effectively condemning the local flora and fauna in the immediate vicinity of the mine. Although reclamation using bonds has been shown to work in some cases, it is just as common for reclamation funding to run out and for mine sites to be abandoned, leaving hollow scars on the land. Lastly, the outdoor recreation industry has grown in recent years to be 2.2% of the GDP (2016), and has grown faster than the US GDP (GDP growth in 2016 was 1.6%, while outdoor recreation grew by 1.7%). While industry and mining are certainly valuable for economic growth, it is not renewable in any way whatsoever, whereas the use of this land for recreation and enjoyment would bring more value to the American people in the long run. I would lastly like to put in my own personal bias as an outdoor enthusiast. Like many Americans, I work in an office job, in my case the auto industry. But every second of my life spent working behind the desk is for the sake of being able to leave it and enjoy the few places left like Oak Flat. With each and every move made towards destroying these beautiful outdoor areas, my motivation and reason for contributing to this society decreases, as I have less and less to work for. Like you said yourself upon entering your position: ""The Tonto National Forest is one of the most-visited, complex, and diverse national forests in the nation. It's just a fascinating forest, with its ecological diversity and high recreation use -- a destination forest for Arizonians as well as visitors from all over the world.""

Suggesting that 1,000-year groundwater prediction models are not reliable, a 200 year model has been selected within reasonable measure to be used by the Resolution Copper Mine.

Resolution Copper Mine has made additional notes regarding water quality outcomes that “if a lake developed, it is not possible to predict the details necessary to conduct even a rudimentary analysis of effects”. Broad conclusions have been drawn regarding potential water quality of a subsidence lake, and potential levels of copper in the water would be above Arizona’s standards for quality.

Just the fact that it overrides the wishes of President Eisenhower when he set this land aside from development, not to mention that it completely disregards the rights of Native Americans is extremely repulsive, especially when one considers that the corporation benefitting from this is a foreign one and those benefits and profits that it will enjoy will not end up doing much for we Americans. This is wrong. And as for the corporation, Rio Tinto in general. Their track record of human rights abuses, pollution violations, inadequate conformity to reasonable stewardship of the land, and general attitude toward neighbors and governments both local and national is a bit appalling. I have no doubt that ""Resolution Copper Mine"" is nothing more than a glorified shell corporation designed to keep a distance between Rio Tinto, it's executives and it's shareholders from any regulations and agreements that Resolution may enter into and supposedly be required to abide by. I have no doubt that the powers that be at Rio Tinto would not hesitate for a second to throw Resolution Copper and it's employees ""under the bus"" in a heartbeat if a situation called for such action. Now given my beliefs and the fact that so many Mining corporations have such a devastating and deplorable record of being good stewards and trustworthy I suggest the following.

I don’t see anywhere in the EIS a cost identified for the potential detrimental health effects of these mine tailings. Considering the densely populated areas within range of the tailing sites, the potential lawsuit for health related issues is potentially astronomical. How would the state deal with that? If the mine were to be sued it is likely they would take the usual strategy of filing for bankruptcy to avoid payout of any funds, and if anything would reform under another entity, as we have seen so often in the past. This of course brings up the ever-present issue of polluting mines which are currently not held accountable in our state. The number of mines who have failed to clean up toxic pollution is a burden on taxpayers, the residents of Arizona and does not appear to be accounted for anywhere in the EIS. What appears to be the preferred tailings dump site currently would destroy over 350 archeological sites. What value has the Forest Service applied to these sites?

While many ways of measuring air quality were highlighted in this section, the report failed to explain how an impact to air quality standards will be mitigated. So my question to the Forest services is to explain how the mine proposes to mitigate its impact or are you stating that the air quality standards around the project are will just be amended to include greater concentrations in the atmosphere? In particular for the NAAQS, HAPs, PM2.5, and PM10 which will be impacted. Furthermore, section 3.6.4.4 of the DEIS states that “Forest services are in the process of developing a robust mitigation plan to avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce or compensate for resource impacts” which in this case the resource would be good air quality standards. Can the forest services elaborate on the development of the proposed “mitigation plan” for the air quality concerns that have been identified in this section of DEIS?

As discussed below, because TNF has relied and is relying on the DEIS, exclusively, to afford the public an opportunity to learn about, participate in, and offer feedback on and in the Section 106 process for RCPLx, Archaeology Southwest advises TNF to extend the public comment period to enable compliance with the regulations at 36 CFR 800.2(d)(1). Those regulations state, in part, “The agency official shall seek and consider the views of the public in a manner that reflects the nature and complexity of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties, the likely interest of the public in the effects on historic properties.” The extension we request must, of course, be accompanied by substantial amendments to the DEIS or by other means through which TNF will provide the public with non-sensitive information about (1) the historic properties that would be affected by the RCPLx (that is, types, sizes, affinities, general distributions, National Register of Historic Places [NRHP] eligibilities, and patterned correlations among these attributes, etc.); (2) the planned or reasonably foreseeable adverse effects—direct, indirect, and cumulative—of RCPLx on historic properties (that is, the nature, extent, general distributions, timing, and intensities of effects); and (3) the plans and options for resolving adverse effects to historic properties.

"NP10","NEPA: 106 Consultation","NP","NEPA Process"," TNF has determined to use the NEPA process to involve the public in the Section 106 process for RCPLx, thereby “funneling” and otherwise limiting public involvement opportunities into NEPA scoping and DEIS commenting.

See also, https://businessdocbox.com/Green_Solutions/76786942-Resolution-copper-project-and-land-exchange-enviromental-impact-statement.html.] Given the reasonableness of these comments and their clear alignment with applicable Federal laws and policies, we are dismayed to find so little information regarding cultural resources in the DEIS, and almost no evidence of prior consultation. The information provided is unequivocally insufficient to enable public analysis and input. The RCPLx DEIS Section 1.7.4 acknowledges that RCPLx “would profoundly and permanently alter the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)-listed Chí’chil Biłdagoteel (Oak Flat) Historic District Traditional Cultural Property (TCP) through anticipated large-scale geological subsidence…. development of the proposed tailings storage facility at any of the four proposed or alternative locations would permanently bury or otherwise destroy many prehistoric and historic cultural artifacts, potentially including human burials.” TNF presents DEIS Section 3.12 to satisfy NEPA requirements by describing potentially affected cultural resources, RCPLx effects on those resources, and Section 106 requirements (at 36 CFR 800.2(d)(3)) to “provide the public with information about an undertaking and its effects on historic properties and seek public comment and input.” Instead of satisfying these clear mandates, however, Section 3.12 provides a general, two-page summary of regional culture history, a one-paragraph description of methods used to identify cultural resources, and a sterile statistical abstract of cultural resource sites significantly impacted / adversely affected by the six planning alternatives and across the direct, indirect, and atmospheric impact areas. The entirety of the DEIS description of affected cultural resources is readily reproduced in seven short bullet points: • “inventories have resulted in the recordation of 721 archaeological sites and three historical buildings or structures within the direct analysis area” (DEIS pg. 627); and • “Of the 721 sites, 523 are recommended or determined eligible for the NRHP, 118 are recommended or determined not eligible for the NRHP, 78 are undetermined, and two are exempt from Section 106 compliance” (DEIS pg. 628); and • “site components are attributed to Archaic peoples (19), Hohokam (81), Hohokam-Salado (73), Salado (330), Apache-Yavapai (25), Native American (116), Euro-American (189), and unknown (4). Archaeological sites found in the analysis area represent short- and longterm habitations, agricultural sites, resource procurement and processing sites, campsites, a historic-age campground, communication sites, ranching sites, mining sites, soil conservation, utilities, transportation (roads and trails), recreation activities, water management, and waste management” (DEIS pg. 628); and • “One NRHP-listed TCP is located within the direct analysis area” (DEIS pg. 628); and • “Twenty-one historic buildings or structures have been recorded within the direct analysis area” (17 of which are associated with the Magma Mine; 14 of the 17 have already been demolished; TNF considers the other 4 not eligible for NRHP) (DEIS pg. 628); and • “Applicant-committed environmental protection measures by Resolution Copper to reduce impacts on cultural resources are covered in detail in the Programmatic Agreement” (DEIS pg. 630); and, finally • “Mitigation of adverse effects on historic properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D, the potential to provide significant information about the past, most often consists of data recovery to gather the information prior to disturbance. A Programmatic Agreement (see appendix O) is currently being developed to address adverse effects on historic properties under Section 106 of the NHPA. Mitigation of adverse effects on historic properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C would be developed in consultation with the appropriate Indian Tribes, SHPO, and other interested parties and would be outlined in a historic properties treatment plan and/or a TCP Redress Plan as stipulated by the PA” (DEIS pg. 638). These seven bullet points and the draft (version 5) Programmatic Agreement represent the entirety of substantive cultural resource description and analysis included in the DEIS and made available to enlist public involvement in the RCPLx Section 106 process. Our comment is that the roughly 350 words represented by the seven bullet points—less than one word per cultural resource site slated for irrevocable alteration by RCPLx—unmistakably fail to meet any meaningful test, qualitative or quantitative, of disclosure or analysis. The DEIS Appendix J “Mitigation and Monitoring Plan” for the project contains a one-word entry for cultural resources: “None” (DEIS pg. 37)."

Queen Creek flows west, towards Arizona Water's Ranch 160 well site, which is located less than one mile from Queen Creek. Additional downstream seepage collection ponds with cutoff walls and pumpback wells are being suggested, to diminish the likelihood of groundwater contamination.

"
"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Preventative methods for seepage have been proposed for Skunk Camp, including low permeability liners, compacted fine tailings, a grouting process to seal ground fractures and a seepage collection pond placed downstream. Higher precautionary measures must be taken if this alternative is selected, because low-permeability liners still allow seepage to occur and seepage collection ponds are not fully reliable unless they are properly maintained, monitored, and sampled. These safety precautions are beneficial, but will not provide complete seepage control, especially since this alternative only extracts 60% of the water in the tailings. Providing high quality drinking water to our customers is imperative to Arizona Water and with this project occurring close to the aquifers that we use as a source of drinking water, tailings seepage is a concern that needs to be mitigated and addressed by ADEQ. Arizona Water suggests using the filtered tailings processing method of Alternative 4, in order to control the water quality, decrease external water use, and reduce tailings seepage in the aquifers. We also request Resolution Copper to provide stronger seepage controls for groundwater in the East Salt River Valley sub-basin and monitor around water quality to ensure the health and safety of the public. The Gila River is located south of the Skunk Camp site, and can easily be contaminated by the tailings seepage. If there is contamination, the water will flow towards Coolidge and Florence, Arizona. Two of Arizona Water's Coolidge water system wells, which supply over half of the water production in Coolidge, are located less than half a mile south of the Gila River. These wells are the two largest sources of supply for the city of Coolidge, altogether producing over three million gallons per day. Contamination of this well site would result in a loss of a much needed drinking water supply and potential health risks to city residents and our customers. While Skunk Camp is the most distant location from the residents in this region, the topography makes it likely for water quality to be contaminated. Arizona Water requests Resolution Copper to construct additional monitoring wells between Resolution Copper's mining operations and Arizona Water's drinking water wells to properly and sufficiently determine the various contaminants associated with Resolution Copper's operation. These additional monitoring wells must be properly designed to allow discrete sampling of specific areas of the aquifer using nested monitoring wells. The valuable water sources in this area are at risk of contamination and Resolution Copper must take all necessary measures to protect them. "

The Winkelman wells are the sole source of drinking water for the town of Winkelman, pumping approximately 684,000 gallons per day. If contamination occurs, it could cause serious health risks to Winkelman residents and Arizona Water's customers. Winkelman's drinking water supply has already been affected by ASARCO's mining operation and Arizona Water requests Resolution Copper take extra precautions in preserving this drinking water supply from any further pollution and contamination."
"3.7.06","Water Resources: Water Supply Wells / Drinking Water","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Arizona Water is also concerned about Resolution Copper's proposed operation on the drinking water supplies the company has relied on since 1955, and its predecessor prior to 1955, and will continue to rely upon indefinitely. According to the draft EIS, water available for this project includes Central Arizona Project (CAP) and groundwater pumped from the East Salt River Valley (ESRV) sub-basin. Resolution Copper also holds approximately 256,000 acre-feet of long-term storage credits for CAP water stored in the Phoenix AMA. The proposed project is expected to use between 180,000 and 590,000 acre-feet of water during the life of the project. At 590,000 acre-feet, the annual demand of the project would be nearly 12,000 acre-feet per year. Arizona Water currently pumps approximately 8,500 acre-feet per year. This project represents a nearly 150% increase in groundwater pumping at the edge of the ESRV sub-basin in an area already vulnerable to groundwater depletion. Anything that would further deplete the drinking water supply would harm the approximately 27,000 existing Arizona Water customers that rely upon groundwater every day and devalue the land of future development. Resolution Copper and Arizona Water are currently working together on an agreement to protect its water source and we are hopeful we can adequately resolve our concerns. "

New models are expected to show that declines are more significant today than in the mid-2000s. Adding additional wells and extracting more groundwater here will further decrease water levels. Arizona Water requests Resolution Copper provides evidence in the Final EIS demonstrating this project will not cause any significant water level declines in the short and long-term. Arizona Water feels strongly that this commitment should be memorialized into any final Record of Decision and as mitigation in the 404 permit, with appropriate funding and/or bonding attached. "

Furthermore, while it is the ancestral land of the San Carlos Apache, it is currently held as public land, as part of the Tonto National Forest, and as such it is land held in common for the enjoyment of us all. To every human being, it is wilderness that nourishes our souls with beauty and solitude. We, the Elders of Southside Presbyterian Church, are deeply concerned about the proposed destruction of this sacred land through mining by Resolution Copper, which was given the rights to mine in 2014 when Senator John McCain added a late-night rider to an unrelated defense bill - a process that we feel was both undemocratic and dishonest. The proposed mine would desecrate this land in many ways. It dishonors the presence and traditions of the Apache people who have lived there for centuries. It destroys a vital part of Earth in complete disregard for its life and the life of its inhabitants. It elevates profit over people and Earth. It leaves a depleted natural legacy and a self-centered spiritual legacy for our children and grandchildren. In all these ways, it tears at our human spirit and diminishes us as human beings.

In general, based on the data analyzed in the assessment, it appears that the vast majority of positive socioeconomic impacts from the project will accrue to entities other than local rural Copper Corridor communities directly affected, including to the federal government, State of Arizona, counties, and statewide school districts, while the majority of negative impacts will be felt by the Town of Superior, which borders the project, with anticipated increased costs for municipal services, maintenance and upgrades to local infrastructure, housing and service challenges, and impacts to recreational resources/tourism opportunities. Predicted positive economic impacts to the Town of Superior and Copper Corridor communities calculated by the econometric models are relatively insignificant compared to increased costs. These data may not account for all income or cost factors. We are also concerned that the models used, and predictions resulting from them, do not consider the economic and social hardship realities of Copper Corridor communities and may be weighted to other rural communities that are not in the shadows of active mining and development."

No mitigation is outlined for socioeconomic and environmental justice impacts. These issues are of paramount importance to the communities directly affected by the project. Rio Tinto’s “social license to operate” policies and practices have historically provided mitigation and compensation for negative impacts, and we recognize that the company has been working with the community in developing compensatory measures. The CWG established a subcommittee to investigate the options and details of establishing a community fund, trust, or other independent funding mechanism to support the socioeconomic initiatives of the region, as compensation for mine-related impacts. These discussions were suspended while negotiations occurred for specific agreements, as outlined in the DEIS; we hope that this initiative will be explored further by RCM and Rio Tinto.
Members of the CWG wish to memorialize socioeconomic mitigation agreements through the authority of the EIS process. The CWG requests that the following measures be committed by Resolution Copper Mining and included in the ROD:
1.) Continue to extend (as relevant) and negotiate new agreements with the Town of Superior similar to the Agreements detailed in the DEIS to fund specific needs and projects based on mine development and operation impacts.
2.) Establish numeric or percentage targets for local hiring.
3.) Establish numeric or percentage targets for using local suppliers and services.
4.) Agree to further explore the concept of establishing a community fund or foundation to provide long-term support for local projects and initiatives aimed at mitigating mine-related impacts and enhancing the quality of life in the region, in accordance with Rio Tinto’s social license to operate. As suggested by the Town of Superior in its DEIS comments, this foundation should be funded by an endowment sufficient to generate interest income to fund the mitigation not addressed by bonding. The foundation should have an independent board of directors.
5.) Agree to continue conversations and provide funding for feasibility studies for initiatives aimed at preserving the cultural heritage of Superior and the region, including development of a Cultural Heritage and Mining Museum. As envisioned, these initiatives were designed as mitigation for the loss of the historic and culturally-important smelter stack and associated buildings at the West Plant site. Provide funding for development of agreed-upon projects as feasible."

This assessment is focused on external economic impacts of the project but fails to address the specific internal social aspects of Copper Corridor communities that would help to explain the “human” impacts of this giant endeavor. The history of this region is integral to the way local communities view this project. Many current residents were themselves miners and come from a long history of mining families. Some of the public skepticism and mistrust of large and foreign mining companies has been shaped by their experiences, and these are important issues that Resolution Copper Mining is working to overcome. As well, the demographic profile of the affected communities speaks to the importance of their cultural heritage and has helped to shape their values. Not only the economic conditions of the communities but their social conditions will shape the ways in which they are able to respond to the challenges of the Resolution Copper Project. These types of assessments are particularly important since the affected areas have been defined as Environmental Justice communities.

Preferred Tailings Site:
The Skunk Camp site, while more remote from some communities, may be of concern to those other communities who now find themselves in proximity. Consequently, the CWG has attempted to expand its membership to include representatives from Kearny, Winkelman, and Gila County. We have not spoken with residents of Dripping Springs nor are they represented on the CWG, so their concerns are unknown to us. As we understand it, local communities to this site are particularly worried about potential water resource and quality impacts of the tailings facility, due to its location upstream of the Gila River and the serious water supply problems currently experienced in this region. Because there is limited housing and service availability in these small communities, they feel that they will not benefit economically from this facility. There is also a perception that “enough is enough”, as these communities have been living with the Asarco Ray Mine for generations.
The CWG recognizes and respects that the communities of Dripping Springs, Kearny, Winkelman and Hayden have only recently been brought into the EIS process and likely have varying opinions about this site.

As part of its focus on cultural heritage and support for economic diversification of the region, the CWG would like to explore the possibility of using the MARRCO rail line for a tourist train.

However, if the rail line will be used to transport materials from Superior to the remote filter plant site, we hope that a co-use could be investigated.

Trees in National Forests do have rights to water to sustain them. This has been shown again and again in Federal cases, including Arizona. Laws exist to protect water supply and levels in National Forests  Development and Status of Federal Reserved Water Rights: The mandate regarding Federal rights to water was established in 1908 by Winters v. United States. When the United States reserves public land for uses such as Indian reservations, military reservations, national parks, forest, or monuments, it also implicitly reserves sufficient water to satisfy the purposes for which the reservation was created. Both reservations made by presidential executive order or those made by an act of Congress have implied reserved rights. The date of priority of a federal reserved right is the date the reservation was established. Subsequent laws have attempted to water down the original intent. However, in a case in 1999 in Arizona regarding water on BLM land, a Federal Judge reaffirmed the Federal rights are still in tact. The presiding judge wrote, “The [Winter’s] Doctrine applies not only to Indian reservations, but to other federal enclaves, such as national parks, forests, monuments, military bases, and wildlife preserves.” The Federal rights to water in our public lands, including National Forests were reasserted again in the Gila River Adjudication in Arizona: SUPREME COURT OF ARIZONA 195 Ariz. 411;989 P.2d 739;1999 Copy of entire case http://www.g-a-l.info/AZAdjudication.htm From Opinion by Judge Noel A. Fidel: The reserved water rights doctrine provides: When the Federal Government withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose, the Government, by implication, reserves appurtenant water then un-appropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation. In so doing the United States acquires a reserved right in unappropriated water which vests on the date of the reservation and is superior to the rights of future appropriators. Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S. 128, 138, 48 L. Ed. 2d 523, 96 S. Ct. 2062 (1976).

Both direct and indirect; past, present and future water quality and availability impacts on the region must be considered, including the ecological interdependency of species. Similarly, cumulative impacts to soil and air quality in the past, present and future, both direct and indirect, must be considered with regard to the proposed project. Impacts to plant, animal, and human life must be detailed in this comprehensive manner, in the spirit and intent, as well as word of the EPA. The proposed project will have extremely negative and unavoidable impacts on Native American cultural and religious freedom, including traditional Native American (Apache) religious practices and ceremonies, traditional food availability and food gathering ways, and traditional dwelling materials, which all rely on the preservation of this particular location and region. The impacts of the proposed project must be considered cumulatively in a temporal and comprehensive manner. The Native people impacted by this proposal have already endured longstanding and multiple, ongoing negative impacts of activities in the area (per EPA’s intent and word on the meaning of cumulative impacts as meaning any activity, including those activities that predate EPA). The previous specific impacts, such as forced relocation, violation of religious freedom, denial of access to traditional lands, should all be considered, in unison with potential future impacts of other activities and potential projects in the future that may have any negative impact on this population. The proposed mine would violate religious freedom of these peoples by its very existence, in addition to denial of access to areas and land that holds crucial historical, religious, and cultural importance. This DEIS did not adequately evaluate and state all impacts—past, present and future in this section of the document. No alternatives would adequately preserve the land from indirect and direct impacts that this mining project would have. Cumulative indirect and direct impacts should also be considered for safe and enjoyable access to these historically public lands by the public for recreational purposes. Currently, there are already visual impacts that negatively affect enjoyment of the area, as well as the visible dewatering and water pollution. This must be considered together with any future direct and indirect impacts. Studies of other similar mining operations and tailings designs and their impacts on water and land and air quality, as well as wildlife, should be clearly considered and evaluated for impacts on recreational use of this and adjacent land by people who travel from all over this continent as well as other countries to camp, hike, picnic and enjoy other outdoor activities."

The middle and lower reaches of Devils Canyon, from km 9.14 to the confluence with Mineral Creek (5.7 miles) have perennial streamflows, arising both from discrete springs along its walls and from groundwater inflow from the Apache Leap Tuff aquifer along the channel bottom. This groundwater originates from the Apache Leap Tuff aquifer. DEIS, vol. 1 at 313; Review of Numerical Groundwater Model Construction and Approach (Mining and Subsidence Area)(BGC Engineering, November 1, 2018). The middle and lower reaches of Devils Canyon are a Groundwater- Dependent Ecosystem (GDE). DEIS, Vol. 1 at 312. This GDE consists of a 2.1 mile long, 50-acre riparian gallery and a 0.5 mile long saturated reach with several large perennial pools. Dominant riparian species are sycamore, cottonwood, ash, alder, and willow, and wetland species at spring locations. DEIS, Vol. 1 at 329. Action: The effects of the Resolution Project on this important riparian area are of great importance to AGFD. AGFD requests the following comments and actions be considered for this GDE. "

The MODFLOWSURFACT model was used to model the groundwater impacts related to Resolution Mine's panel caving and dewatering activities related to ore removal. But the model's large grid cells could not be used to accurately model baseflow discharge to perennial reaches of Devils Canyon. As a result, the model cannot predict changes to Devil’s Canyon stream flows as a result of the Resolution Mine Project.

This is estimated to take five years. In the arid environment of the Southwest, areas of open water are an important resource for wildlife, particularly for migrating passerine and waterfowl species that seek open water for resting and drinking. Migratory birds will be attracted to open water at the Resolution Mine site. The recycled water pond can be expected to acidify after closure. As the ponded water evaporates, the water acidifies and becomes toxic to birds through exposure and ingestion. Mine tailings ponds have been documented to contain high concentrations of sulfuric acid (low pH levels) and metals. This occurred at the Arizona Morenci Mine site, where avian mortalities occurred on an inactive tailings impoundment. Phelps Dodge Corporation entered into a plea agreement with the Justice Department under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and a civil settlement with the United States and the State of Arizona for natural resource damages for avian mortalities in United States of America, et al. v.

Also include a discussion about preserving the ability of wildlife species to move between or within habitat blocks. Linkages allow animals to access essential resources such as food and water during their daily activities.They also allow longer seasonal migratory movements between summer and winter habitats and facilitate the dispersal movements of animals in search of mates or breeding sites. Linkages that connect otherwise isolated populations help prevent small populations from extinction (Laurance1991, Beier and Loe 1992), help maintain genetic diversity, and reduce the risk of inbreeding(Beier and Loe 1992, Bennett 1999). Habitat connectivity also helps ensure that critical ecological processes such as pollination and seed dispersal, which often depend on animal intermediaries, are maintained. In some cases the linkages themselves may sustain actively reproducing wildlife populations (Perault and Lomolino 2000, Beier et al. 2007). Linkages are also expected to play an important role in helping animal populations adapt to and endure the effects of climate change by allowing animals to shift their range with latitude or elevation asvegetation communities change their distribution and suitable environmental conditions shift of the landscape (Hannah et al. 2002, Glick et al. 2009).

The lands included are also within the Game Management Units, as identified by the AGFD as 24A, 24B and 37B. A valid hunting license is required on all public lands as well as those managed by ASLD. In addition, the following should be included: Currently hunting opportunities within the vicinity of the project area in Game Management Units (GMUs) 24A, 24B, and 37B include: six out of Arizona’s ten big game species (mule deer, white-tailed deer, javelina, mountain lion, black bear, and bighorn sheep), small game (cottontail, jackrabbit, Gambel’s quail, scaled quail), migratory game birds (mourning dove, white-winged dove, and band-tailed pigeon) and fur bearing or predatory mammals (e.g. coyote and bobcat). Species such as these are considered Species of Economic and Recreational Importance (SERI) to AGFD and citizens of Arizona (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2012). Several of these species currently occupy habitat that has 100% overlap with the proposed RCM project area including the TSF alternatives, tailings pipeline corridors and/or new power lines. The majority of the proposed RCM project area is located within GMU 24B. The Near West TSF alternatives 2 or 3 and Silver King TSF alternative 4 are located in GMU 24B; the East Plant Site and Skunk Camp TSF alternative 6 locations are in GMU 24A; and the Peg Leg TSF alternative 5 location is in GMU 37B. Several proposed mine features either currently exist, or would be located exclusively on private lands, or are linear features (pipelines or powerlines) in all 3 GMUs.Based on the values mapping, AGFD notes that a moderate to high number of participants (hunters) found portions of the Near West TSF alternative 2 or 3 west of Superior (GMU 24B) to be of high value for hunting mule deer, white-tailed deer, javelina, quail, dove, and predators. In the area of the Silver King TSF alternative 4 (GMU 24B), a moderate to high number of participants valued the area for mule deer and predator hunting; but a low to moderate number of participants valued it for javelina, quail and dove hunting. As elevations increase to the north and east in the Montana and Peachville Mountain areas near Silver King; more hunters highly valued the area for white-tailed deer hunting. The area of the Peg Leg TSF alternative 5 in GMU 37B is highly valued by a high to moderate number of participants for quail, javelina and predator hunting; and moderate to low number of participants for dove, mule deer and white-tailed deer hunting. The area of the East Plant Site in GMU 24A is highly valued by a moderate to high number of participants for quail and predator hunting; and a low to moderate number of participants for dove, javelina, mule deer and white-tailed deer. The area of the Skunk Camp TSF alternative 6 in GMU 24A is highly valued by a high number of participants for quail hunting, but a low number for dove hunting.

Using GIS and routes identified in the TNF TMP, AGFD calculated there would be 23.49 miles of roads and 1737 acres of dispersed camping opportunity on the TNF lost to the RCM project footprints (TSF, Barrows, Tailings Corridor, MAARCO; Table 13 and Appendix 6). The majority of the routes that would be eliminated are unmaintained routes that do not require technical 4x4 vehicles or skill, and which are also popular for dispersed camping. The motorized routes that would remain open around RCM facilities are more rugged and require more technical 4x4 vehicles and skill. As a result, the motorized routes remaining open would not accommodate all classes of vehicles and would restrict access to those 4x4 only. Map 3 illustrates the access routes around the perimeter of the proposed Near West TSF alternative 2 or 3 and mine facilities suitable for OHV and extreme 4x4 vehicles and users with technical skill levels. The loss of access also equates to elimination of motorized dispersed camping opportunity from the most accessible low elevation portions of the high hunter use area depicted in Map 3 (TRCP survey indicates a moderate to high number of hunters value the area). Loss of motorized routes and dispersed camping areas would likely result in more concentrated recreation levels and congested conditions (e.g. camping, OHV, recreational shooting, horseback riding etc.) along remaining low elevation access points close to US Highway 60.

The massive consumption of water by the mine, in a severe drought period, with Colorado River water restrictions coming, will lead to widespread dewatering due to groundwater pumping in Pinal County, which is already expected to have an 8,000,000 acre-foot shortfall of water over the next hundred years, according to ADWR. https://kjzz.org/content/1242431/pinal-county-faces-100-year- water-shortage. The RCM mine, by itself, could add another 1,000,000 acre-feet to this already projected deficit. This will necessarily take water from communities and agriculture competing for the same water resources. The environmental impacts of this additional burden to the water supply have not been analyzed, and must be included in any meaningful EIS."
"IA01","Issues Analysis: Proposed New Issue","IA","Issues Analysis","No environmental analysis has been done on the two 230kV transmission line corridors that will run across USFS land. SRP and Resolution Copper are planning for large-scale new 230kV and 69kV transmission lines and power substations for this mine project. In the Federal Register dated March 18, 2016, under “Nature of Decisions to be Made” the Forest Service contemplates issuing a special use permit for these activities. It is unclear from this language whether the Forest Service intends to exempt the power lines and substations from full EIS analysis and instead only require the special use permit alone. The construction of these transmission lines and substations constitute major changes to the environment and are interdependent parts to the larger overall mine project that must be considered together in a single NEPA document. This is clearly evidenced by the Resolution mining plan of operation dedicating an entire section to the provision of power for the project (section 3.5.1., in the version of the mining plan currently appearing on the Forest Service website) and also evidenced in Section 3003 of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, specifically stating that “approvals for the construction of associated power” must be included in the EIS: 5 Engineering and Mining Journal, April 2014 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. — Prior to conveying Federal land under this section, the Secretary shall prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 25 seq.), which shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine and the Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, rights-of-way, or approvals for the construction of associated power, water, transportation, processing, tailings, waste disposal, or other ancillary facilities. New 230kV transmission lines from the existing 115kV substation to the mine will be installed within a new corridor or right-of-way through the Tonto National Forest and cannot be run through the existing power line right-of-way. That is because the existing 115kV lines will also need to remain in place. The Forest Service therefore must study all environmental impacts associated with the development of a new power line corridor. These issues include possible impacts on existing wildlife, air and water quality, among others. The environmental impacts associated with the new, larger 230kV substation also need to be carefully studied by a full EIS. In a similar way, the new 69kV transmission line along the MARRCO corridor and new 69kV substation near the load out facility also need to be thoroughly studied for potential impacts to wildlife, air and water quality issues and other possible environmental impacts. This aspect of the mine project also deserves a full EIS treatment. Finally, with respect to transmission lines, a new transmission line will be required if the Skunk Camp location is chosen as the tailings storage site. The DEIS states that “a new power line would be constructed from the existing Silver King substation north of U.S. 60 and Oak Flat that would follow a southeast alignment for 11.7 miles to the Skunk Camp location. Preliminary assessment of line voltage options show that either a 69-kV or 115-kV voltage level would be adequate to supply power to Skunk Camp. Further assessment by the electrical utility operating Silver King substation would be needed to determine the adequate voltage and construction engineering, including access roads to service Skunk Camp.” Again, for the reason stated (a single environmental impact statement) this “construction engineering including access roads to service Skunk Camp” should have been included in this DEIS, in order to allow proper commenting by those who will be affected."
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","Finally, the Forest Service should not permit any mining plan of operation unless they are reasonably certain that the mine applying for the required permits can actually build and operate their mine, as stated in their General Plan of Operation. This is particularly true as in this case, where the negative impacts to the environment, to recreation, and to Native American rights are so significant. There is currently more than a reasonable doubt that Resolution Copper can actually build and operate this mine at Oak Flat. A thorough report by Dr. Steven Emerman, PhD geophysicist from Cornell University, points out that the RCM mine could well require up to 22% of the entire generating capacity of the Salt River Project to operate the mine—and that the water required for the mine is likely to be three times higher than what RCM claims in their GPO. http://azminingreform.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/Arizona_Mining_Reform_Coalition_Report2_FINAL.pdf 7 National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106 The higher power requirement is based on estimated heat load to the mine, and the higher water use estimate is fully consistent with the figure of 40,000 acre-feet per year stated by both Bruno Hegner and John Rickus, former General Manager and President of RCM, respectively."

The language above allows the Secretary of Agriculture to convey the approximately 2,422 acres of public land at Oak Flat to RCM as soon as the Final EIS is published—and requires said transfer of ownership no later than 60 days after final EIS publication. That means that any final EIS objection period, resolution of objections, and final Record of Decision on both the land exchange and RCM General Plan of Operation (GPO) may occur after RCM has already taken title to the public land at Oak Flat. Since transfer of title to this currently public land will cause irreparable harm to Native Americans, recreational users of Oak Flat, and to the environment, this is highly problematic and demonstrates exactly why this DEIS is somewhat different than a typical DEIS. Because there may be no meaningful opportunity to object after the final EIS is issued, the DEIS for this proposed project must be complete and inclusive of all aspects of the mine project. The DEIS must include any and all impacts on which the public should have an opportunity to comment. Unfortunately, the current version of the DEIS is severely lacking.

Oak Flat has been Federally protected from all mining activity since 1955. In spite of being located in an established mining district, the Eisenhower administration realized the recreational importance of Oak Flat for camping and other recreational uses and specifically withdrew it from mining for those purposes by issuing PLO 1229. Oak Flat is an important and irreplaceable recreational resource for rock climbers and boulderers in Arizona and around the world. The proposed Resolution mine project will result in the largest loss of recreational rock climbing in the history of the United States. This will be due to surface subsidence caused by the block cave mining method that Resolution proposes for this project. The rock climbing resources at Oak Flat are irreplaceable, and cannot be mitigated for or managed under a 1:1 replacement strategy common in mitigation and restoration plans. Oak Flat climbing is a high value, site-specific resource with significant historical value. For fifteen years running, until 2004, Oak Flat was the location for the world’s largest rock climbing competition—the Phoenix Boulder Blast.

Although estimates and methods of measurement differ, sources affirmatively conclude that outdoor recreation generates many hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer spending nationally.4 Data also shows that outdoor recreation generated more than $21 billion in the State of Arizona alone.

Crossing of the Arizona Trail will “interfere with the nature and purposes of the Arizona Trail” (DEIS p. 501). This is contrary to the purpose of the legislative designation as a National Scenic Trail (16 U.S.C. § 1242(a)(2)) which specifies that scenic trails are “so located as to provide for maximum outdoor recreation potential and for the conservation and enjoyment of the nationally significant scenic, historic, natural, or cultural qualities of the areas through which such trails may pass.” Although robust, publicly available documentation exists regarding the characteristics of the Arizona Trail which is required for Scenic Trail designation under 16 U.S.C. § 1244(b), it is apparent that none of this documentation was reviewed. The DEIS lists only a few short-term limitations on access during construction. Long-term impacts and discussions of actual meaningful mitigation measures (and analysis of the potential effectiveness of those measures) is disappointingly inadequate. Furthermore, to the extent that mitigation to the Arizona Trail is discussed at all as a vague and non-specific promise to construct road crossings, pipeline crossings or reroutes to “minimize impediments…and visual impacts” to the Arizona Trail, this is only a voluntarily proposed and non-required measure and cannot be reasonably relied upon or analyzed as an actual mitigation plan. Additionally, the DEIS fails entirely to discuss how the potential impacts to the Arizona Trail from this project relate to the ongoing “Arizona National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan” (which is also being undertaken by the Tonto National Forest and which is anticipated being released for public comment in May 2020) – in fact, the ongoing “Arizona National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan” is not discussed or even mentioned in the DEIS, even as a reasonably foreseeable action."

Furthermore, the prior version of this agreement with the Access Fund for access to these areas was unilaterally revocable at any time and, since the current agreement has never been shown to the public, there is no reason to believe that it does not contain these same terms, therefore this tentative arrangement cannot possibly be considered a meaningful mitigation measure. “[O]mission of a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures would undermine the ‘action forcing’ function of NEPA.

These figures come from the Outdoor Industry Association and the Arizona Mining Association, respectively. The Forest Service failed to quantify the dollar contributions of recreation to local and regional economies and therefore the economic losses that would be caused by the mine. USFS should also consider that outdoor recreation is sustainable and can contribute to Arizona’s bottom line in perpetuity. That is why doing an economic study only for the life of the mine is entirely inadequate.

Extrapolating or modeling water impacts on the larger Oak Flat/Superior area from a hydrological study that did not identify a major source of water under the RCM East Plant site is clearly inadequate. Without conducting a new hydrological study of the area, the Forest Service cannot accurately predict the impacts of a mine on the local aquifer. In addition, no geotechnical and hydrological study was done on the Skunk Camp site prior to publication of the DEIS.

This is clearly evidenced by the Resolution mining plan of operation dedicating an entire section to the provision of power for the project (section 3.5.1., in the version of the mining plan currently appearing on the Forest Service website) and also evidenced in Section 3003 of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, specifically stating that “approvals for the construction of associated power” must be included in the EIS: ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. — Prior to conveying Federal land under this section, the Secretary shall prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 25 seq.), which shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine and the Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, rights-of-way, or approvals for the construction of associated power, water, transportation, processing, tailings, waste disposal, or other ancillary facilities. New 230kV transmission lines from the existing 115kV substation to the mine will be installed within a new corridor or right-of-way through the Tonto National Forest and cannot be run through the existing power line right-of-way.

The Forest Service therefore must study all environmental impacts associated with the development of a new power line corridor. These issues include possible impacts on existing wildlife, air and water quality, among others. The environmental impacts associated with the new, larger 230kV substation also need to be carefully studied by a full EIS. In a similar way, the new 69kV transmission line along the MARRCO corridor and new 69kV substation near the load out facility also need to be thoroughly studied for potential impacts to wildlife, air and water quality issues and other possible environmental impacts. This aspect of the mine project also deserves a full EIS treatment.

In the Rosemont ruling, Judge Soto said Hud Bay Mining never proved it had the mineral rights to minerals on those (non-mine) forest acres. Soto ruled that lack of proof made their claim to such land invalid. “Throughout the administrative process, the Forest Service improperly evaluated and misapplied: 1) Rosemont’s right to surface use; 2) the regulatory framework in which the Forest Service needed to analyze those surface rights; and 3) to what extent the Forest Service could regulate activities upon Forest Service land in association with those surface rights. These defects pervaded throughout the FEIS and ROD, and led to an inherently flawed analysis from the inception of the proposed Rosemont Mine.”"

The socioeconomic impacts of the mine that appear in the DEIS extend only through the lifespan of the mine. When evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of the Resolution mine project, the Forest Service should consider that outdoor recreation contributes more than twice as many dollars to Arizona as all of mining does—over $10 billion annually, compared to less than $5 billion for the entire mining industry. These figures come from the Outdoor Industry Association and the Arizona Mining Association, respectively. The Forest Service failed to quantify the dollar contributions of recreation to local and regional economies and therefore the economic losses that would be caused by the mine. USFS should also consider that outdoor recreation is sustainable and can contribute to Arizona's bottom line in perpetuit y. That is why doing an economic study only for the life of the mine is entirely inadequat e. The EIS needs to include an extended socioeconomic analysis for this mine project that goes far beyond the mine's relatively short operating lifetime of roughly 40 years to include the time after mine closure when any financial contribution of the mine to the State will go to zero dollars in perpetuity."

There is currently more than a reasonable doubt that Resolution Copper can actually build and operate this mine at Oak Flat . A thorough report by Dr. Steven Emerman, PhD geophysicist from Cornell University, points out that the RCM mine could well require up to 22% of the entire generating capacity of the Salt River Project to operate the mine-and that the water required for the mine is likely to be three times higher than what RCM claims in their GPO. htt p:/ /azminingre fo rm.org/ wp- cont ent/ uploads/ 2019/ 09/ Arizona M ining Reform Coalit ion Report2 FINAL.pdf The higher power requirement is based on estimated heat load to the mine, and the higher water use estimate is fully consistent with the figure of 40,000 acre-feet per year stated by both Bruno Hegner and John Rickus, former General Manager and President of RCM, respectively."

As a desert state suffering a 15- year drought with imminent climate change that predicts higher temperatures and continued drought conditions, private wells currently running dry in Pima, Pinal and other counties across the state, and increased agriculture production of water intensive crops, like the Saudi alfalfa crops. This utter lack of foresight and AZ water management failures are astounding. Water alone could be the defining factor of the Forest Service saying NO to this foreign interest.

"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Concerns about Mine Groundwater Demands and Water Scarcity in Eastern Phoenix Metro Area We are concerned that the water needs of local communities in the Eastern Phoenix metro area, even without the addition of the mine project, are already strained, and will only be more so with a large mining operation. Resolution Copper essentially gave up on modeling the impacts on groundwater resources from the Desert Wellfield withdrawals claiming it is too difficult to foresee. Yet they acknowledge that, even without any mine withdrawals, the existing groundwater demands on that area exceed physically available water by millions of acre-feet over the next 100 years. The mine’s groundwater withdrawals would constitute an additional demand in the amount of 2-7% of the existing physical groundwater resource. Given that the existing resource is already overcommitted over the 100 year planning horizons envisioned by Arizona’s Groundwater Management Act, we recommend that the Forest Service should not approve a Final EIS without a better understanding of the impacts on existing water users who relied on the availability of this groundwater supply when they developed the area. The existing developments were based on Certificates of Assured Water Supply that were developed without knowledge of Resolution Copper’s demands. The mine should only be developed, and a Final EIS should only issue, after a complete understanding of its water impacts on developments that are reliant on the same water resource. The Resolution Copper Mine estimates of water usage vary widely. In the company’s General Plan of Operations, the estimate is 500,000 acre feet of water over the lifetime of the mine. This is considerably lower than an estimated 640-900,000 acre feet over the forty to fifty year lifetime of the mine if operations consume 16- 18,000 acre feet of water per year as is typical for mines of similar size in Arizona. So far the project has only acquired 349,000 acre feet of stored Central Arizona Project (CAP) water, leaving a potential water shortfall of 150 - 550,000 acre ft. The company states that it still needs to acquire 170,000 acre feet of water, and will look to the CAP or vicinity groundwater for that supply. Climate change and population growth continue to place stress on the Colorado River system, which is already overallocated. Three early signals of the system include the Salton Sea, the Great Salt Lake and Lake Mead. The Salton Sea has declined 7 meters in the past 18 years prompting the declaration of a local state of emergency in October 2019. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is at 40% of its historical capacity. Lake Mead, though actively managed by the recently passed Drought Contingency Plan (DCP) is over 100 ft lower than its’ maximum capacity and faces shortages. In contrast to the bleak picture from these three large lakes, the Phoenix Water Resources Plan indicates that water for future developments is probably available until 2060, despite 44% of the cities’ water being supplied from the Colorado River System via the Central Arizona Project. The CAP was recently forced to take a cut in its supply pursuant to the DCP, and it will likely have continued reductions in its allocation. As this occurs, the CAP will look to acquire new sources of Colorado River water rather than pass the shortage on to Phoenix Water users. Increasing demand for water in the Phoenix area by constructing the Resolution Mine will externalize damages to third parties in the rest of the Colorado River system via the CAP. Like Los Angeles, Phoenix’s growth will come at the expense of far away farms and ecosystems. Recently, CAP began purchasing water in Quartzite, AZ, and has available options to divert all remaining water from the Colorado River Delta by operating the YDP and creating a Drop 2 reservoir to catch unused allotment. These options will likely be exercised in the case of Lake Mead shortages to preserve high priority municipal and industrial uses. If the mine pursues groundwater development rather than Colorado River water, it will be contributing to the overdraft of the Phoenix AMA. In that scenario, its operation will be in conflict with urban development needed to meet Phoenix population growth."

We urge the Forest Service to not finalize the EIS for the proposed Resolution Mine project until actions are included by the project applicant to sufficiently preserve irreplaceable patrimony. The Draft EIS mentions that there is expected to be substantial revenue to the federal government produced from the mine, estimated at over $200 million per year. Is this estimated revenue expected to result even after the land title is transferred from the federal government to the project applicant? As the Forest Service considers the justice of destroying land and artifacts of irreplaceable significance to native communities while accepting federal royalties for mine development, have there been efforts to put these revenues towards attempting to mitigate and compensate these communities for their losses in a manner that they would find acceptable? These issues should be considered in ongoing and full consultation with the impacted native communities."

The deadline for comments is currently November 7, 2019. A copy of our original request is attached. In light of several new conditions, we again ask for the comment deadline to be extended. We note that our reasons for requesting an extension on August 22 still stand and in fact are amplified. We have learned that in a letter dated October 15, 2019, you have given the San Carlos Apache Tribe an additional 45 days to provide comments on the Resolution Copper DEIS. On September 17, 2019, Chairman Terry Rambler of the San Carlos Apache Tribe asked for a 45day extension of the comment period to give the Tribe more time to review the DEIS.

We find the R3PA contains binding and apparently enforceable concurrence on the part of USFS to engage in meaningful public involvement before either the completion of the DEIS process or the execution of the Programmatic Agreement for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine (RCM). Please note, first, that the R3PA contains nothing that limits USFS responsibilities for public involvement in section 106 process to comply with the National Historic Preservation Act. Instead, page 3 of the R3PA affirms: “II. Public Participation A. The FS shall seek and consider the views of the public in a manner that reflects the nature and complexity of each undertaking and its potential effects on historic properties and the likely interest of the public in the effects on historic properties. The FS shall use its procedures for public involvement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to solicit information and concerns about historic properties from members of the public. The FS will ensure that an appropriate level of public involvement is provided, in accordance with 36 CFR 800.2(d)(3). The FS will ensure that environmental documents include information on historic properties that will be affected by the proposed action and alternatives, consistent with Section 304 of NHPA and Section 9 of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA). B. The FS shall ensure public access to findings made pursuant to this Agreement, consistent with Section 304 of NHPA and Section 9 of ARPA, and will consider comments or objections by members of the public in a timely manner.” In keeping with our in-progress comments on the DEIS to be submitted later this week, the public has not been given adequate opportunity to learn about cultural resources in general and historic properties in particular. The DEIS limits its descriptions and analyses of the cultural resources affected by the proposed RCM to a simple list of numbers and descriptors. These convey almost nothing to the public about the cultural, spiritual, educational, scientific, artistic, and communal values embedded in these amazing and irreplaceable resources. In effect, in limiting the description and analysis of cultural resources to a few short pages, and in listing as sources of additional information only survey reports and technical documents not in the public domain, the DEIS fails to “include information on historic properties that will be affected by the proposed action and alternatives.” The brief, highly generalized, DEIS review of a diverse, mostly previously undescribed, and highly significant group of at least 721 separate cultural resource localities, most of which are likely to be irrevocable altered or completely destroyed by the RCM as proposed in the DEIS, utterly fails to meet the regulatory requirement for USFS to “seek and consider the views of the public in a manner that reflects the nature and complexity of each undertaking and its potential effects on historic properties and the likely interest of the public in the effects on historic properties.” Please also note that the DEIS fails to provide anything approximating public involvement in the all-important process of resolving adverse effects to historic properties through avoidance and mitigation. For this crucial purpose of impact reduction, the DEIS relies almost completely on the Appendix O draft Programmatic Agreement (Version 5), a document prepared without the benefit of public involvement. I personally attended the Tucson workshop to assist USFS in preparing the Agreement and can attest that none of the suggestions provided by the participants in that workshop—most of which focused on the central importance of tribal and public involvement in each and every step in the section 106 process—are reflected in Version 5. Version 5 shows no indication of considering the important input provided at that workshop. Even more importantly, it is my understanding that Version 6 of the Agreement was available prior to the release of the DEIS. Version 6 of the Agreement should, of course, have been included in the DEIS to enable public review and comment on the latest, most complete draft. I understand that Version 7 of the Agreement is nearing completion. On the basis of the foregoing facts, the USFS unilateral decision to employ the NEPA process to comply with the public involvement requirements of the section 106 process, and the failure of the DEIS to provide the level of information required to facilitate public review and comment of cultural resource issues, I strongly urge you to take three essential steps to avoid further USFS missteps. First, prepare and enable public review of and comment on “information on historic properties that will be affected by the proposed action and alternatives” that is commensurate with the size, complexity, and adverse effects of the proposed RCM. Second, release and enable public review of and comment on Version 7 (or, at a minimum, Version 6) of the Programmatic Agreement for the proposed RCM. Third, extend the public comment period for the DEIS, for a bare minimum of 30 days following the releases of the information and Agreement, to afford the public our rightful opportunity to participate meaningfully in the NHPA section 106 process."

And I think that should be used as a minimum number. I think they were probably being a little bit low on their estimates at that time. So where's that water going to come from? Supposedly about half a million acre feet have been banked by the mine. But if it is 400,000 -- or 40,000 acre feet per year, there's about 1.2 million acre feet that are completely unaccounted for. They're going to have to get it from somewhere, but where? It's not in the DEIS. It doesn't say where they're going to get the water. Well, probably they're going to pump it from right here, from the ground in Pinal County. And, you know, we're going deeper and deeper into a drought. That water is going to be needed by communities like this, by agricultural, by all kinds of other uses. When you get to a Stage 1 reduction at Hoover Dam and Lake Mead, CAP is going to be cut by an additional 320,000 acre feet per year of water and that's going to just exacerbate this problem. "
"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","They say they're going to take about 250 megawatts of power to run the mine. Where are they going to get it? There's just a little paragraph in the mine plan. And it says they're going to get it from SRP. But they can't get it from the Silver King substation. The 500 megawatt line coming in there is already oversubscribed, according to SRP. And there's a good chance that they're going to need a whole lot more power than that. If they run into more hot water, they could take upwards of a gigawatt, maybe as much as two gigawatts of power. And now you're talking about 25 percent of the entire generating capacity of SRP. I just think there's all kinds of holes in this project and I think a lot more work needs to be done on the EIS. "
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","And this never happens in an environmental impact statement, so I'm not surprised to not see any discussion of it. But in the opening pages, there's always a discussion about the purpose and need. Why do we need -- what's the reason for this project? Why do we need to have it? And the assumption is is that, well, we need to have the Resolution Copper mine because the Resolution Copper mine wants it, and because they think they can make a lot of money digging up that copper. We never get into any philosophical discussion about is this in the long term really a good thing? Obviously it's got tremendous environmental impact statements, which the Forest Service has done a fairly good job, a fairly good job -- there's a lot of holes -- but a fairly good job in trying to uncover them, and I need to give you some credit for that. But the truth of it is is that there's a lot of alternative ways to do things without copper. One of the most -- no homes today are plumbed with copper. It's all gone to plastic. I'm in the air-conditioning business, and the air-conditioning manufacturers are all moving from copper coils to aluminum coils. Aluminum is cheaper, and it transfers heat far better. The copper industry likes to say that, ""Well, we're getting a lot of copper because you've got all these"" -- for example, you have all these electric cars coming on the market. They're going to require a lot of copper. Is that really true? People are working on carbon nanofibers. I'm not quite sure exactly what that is, but I've read stories about it, and they predicted -- people predict this is going to be a replacement conductor for copper. If you want to find alternatives to a particular source like copper, for example, let the price of copper go up. Don't keep building all these copper mines. We probably really don't need them. Let the price of copper go up, and I can guarantee you that we'll find alternatives to copper that will be less environmentally destructive. "
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","A few things that I would like to see in the final EIS, to make it a better document, and I've mentioned this before, and I think I'm crazy, but the purpose of these statement says -- it was a very short statement, the purpose of these statements is supposed to talk about why do we need this project, in this case, why do we need this copper? And I argue that we don't need as much copper as we think that we do. There's never really been a shortage of copper in recent history, to my knowledge. But, in effect, this mine might be that it depresses copper prices to the point where it actually does more harm to the copper industry than it helps, who knows. But think about it, car radiators used to be made exclusively out of copper. You don't see copper radiators any more. Air conditioning coils, they're moving away from copper. They're going to aluminum. There's cheaper and better alternatives. Houses are no longer plumbed in copper. We used to have substitutes on cell -- not on the topic -- but we need copper for electric cars, for motors and so forth. But they're working on new alternatives for that too. We might be doing the industry a favor if we don't permit this mine."
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The Arizona Mines and Mining Department has done one study over Arizona mines to show how much water is used per pound of copper produced. And Resolution Copper says they're going to be able to do this for 15,000 acre feet a year. That study indicated that it would take 10 times as much water and there's no refutation of that study or a discussion of that study in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. And when you look at the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, it has net figures only. You cannot tell how much total water is going to be used. You cannot tell how much water is going to be used in the mine, how much water is going to be used to concentrate, how much water is going to be used to make the slurry to take the waste away. And there's also a figure in there that's used repeatedly to say that 87,000 acre feet are going come from the mine itself. There's an explanation for why the report does that. But they do not include that in their own figures as to the total amount of water that is to be used. That amount should have been included. Number one, that water -- this is water where they de-water the mine. That water is going down to Apache Junction and being used for agricultural uses right now. So if it's not being added and doesn't need to be included that way, it's going to reduce the supply of water that's going to be available for agricultural uses. And there's another reason that 87,000 needs to be looked at. It may disappear. One of things hidden in the environmental impact statement is that the water level near the shafts has dropped by 2,000 feet in the last 10 years. "

Then, we will need to consult with representatives of those organizations in order to provide the Forest Service with thoughtful comments about how to protect this important Apache sacred site and the health and well-being of Arizonans. Our organizations and its members will need to read, assimilate, coordinate, and write constructive comments on the DEIS. The 90-day period is not sufficient. In addition, the short window between now and the five public hearings scheduled also makes it difficult, perhaps impossible for members of our organizations, who are spread throughout the country to make plans to be present, especially since they are scheduled at 5:00 pm on weekdays in areas distant from national transportation hubs.

Although I am sure this statement is true, that no tribe would supports the destruction of their ancestral sites, it does not specify which tribes these sites are important to nor does it explain the importance of these sites and how they are of use to the tribal culture. This shows me that there is a lack of knowledge about these sites and their importance to the respected tribes. Even though The Forest Service and NEPA team worked together with tribes to gather information on tribal values and resources, the teams still can not fully understand the sacredness of these sites. Because of this lack of knowledge on the tribes culture, connections to these historic sites, and complete understanding of the usage of these sites; how can one expect these tribes to feel confident and comfortable that these sites will remain? Until there is this clarity, we need to continue to look for other possibilities for this project. "

Apache Leap may be one of the most historic sites in this location because of the history it had with the tribes ancestors. After learning about the history of this site it showed me the strength and braveness of the tribes ancestors. Also understanding the view the tribal members are able to see today from Apache Leap is just about, if not, the same view their ancestors last saw before they made their jump making it the last thing they saw on this earth. What Apache Leap means and represents to these tribes, we can not fully understand because we have not experienced their culture so why should we have the right to disturb this sacred site. That is why it is important The Resolution Copper Mine complies with the tribes and grants their requests of: leaving it in its natural state, guarantee access, not to renew or reissue the extant grazing permits, and to permit day-use only."

Resolution Copper Mining has committed to making sure that any decrease in water will be replaced. The Town feels strongly that this commitment should be memorialized into any final Record of Decision and as a mitigation in the 404 permit, with appropriate funding and/or bonding attached.

The Town of Superior proposes several steps to augment the mitigation plan, with a focus on prevention rather than only mitigating the loss. The Town has been studying the 1999 Restoration and Management Plan for Queen Creek, and there are many projects within that plan that could be funded through the mitigations that would prevent the water loss and help to restore the Queen Creek watershed. The Town has been working to refine this study into action plans through a National Park Service grant. An executive summary is attached. Many of these plans have been reviewed through an Environmental Assessment and could be implemented immediately. Proposals include: 
• Return Freshwater Mine Inflow Directly into Queen Creek above Magma Bridge, restoring some of the natural flow in Queen Creek by collecting streamflow that has seeped into the mine and discharging it back into the creek. (RMP Action 2) 
• Discharge Treated Mine Dewatering Discharge into the Creek above Magma Bridge to augment the natural flow. (RMP Action 4) 
• Implement a Program to Remove Exotic Vegetation and Manage Floodway Vegetation in Queen Creek. (RMP Action 9 and 11) 
• Construct water retention structures in Queen Creek to improve aquifer recharge (SWT ES) 
• The addition of aquifer recharge strategies to the mitigation plans for the Springs and Seeps in the current mitigation plans. 
These items are all very cost-effective steps to mitigate the direct impact on Queen Creek, and additional items that should be considered include: 
• An alternative water supply should be provided for the Boyce Thompson Arboretum to avoid interruption of the water supply to the gardens due to decreased surface and groundwater availability.
 • Construct an Off-Channel Stormwater Lake on BHP property in Queen Creek. (RMP Action 6)
 • Discharge reclaimed water into Queen Creek at the US 60 Park (RMP Action 2) 
• Install a well below the effluent discharge to supply water to the stormwater lake. (RMP Action 5 and 6)"

"ALT03","Proposed New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","These Draft EIS comments center around obtaining an approved EIS that would also allow the options for solution mining the deposit in place with a small portion of the ore processed at surface, as well as the currently preferred method (block cave mining followed by processing on the surface in a copper concentrator). I believe allowing this optionality in the Project would be beneficial to the success of the project in a number of ways. These benefits would be:  Bring the project to production significantly sooner than the preferred option  Much less water usage compared to preferred method  Much less surface disturbance compared to the preferred method o No surface depressions o Much smaller surface processing area and tailings storage facility (TSF)  Very much reduced amount of PAG tailings in the much smaller TSF, and thus much less acidic solution with metalloid contamination to treat  Significantly reduced capital costs  Perhaps significantly reduced operating costs Natural in-situ leaching of the underground ore body is not practical. The very small water or solution conductivity within the ore prevents natural in-situ leaching from being effective. However, there are artificial means available for increasing ore conductivity/permeability that could make solution mining of most of the ore in place possible. There is the other matter of solution mining primary sulfides. Typically, it is not possible to solution mine primary sulfides effectively on the surface unless the temperature can be raised to the point where high temperature thermophiles can exist and then catalyze the leaching reactions, also need oxygen introduced, to extract the copper from the primary copper minerals (chalcopyrite and bornite). But in the Resolution mine project very high temperatures exist due to its extreme depth. The underground high temperature of the deposit and the excellent heat insulating properties of adjacent ore may make it practical to leach in place from fractured ore the copper using high temperature thermophiles in an acidic ferric sulfate leach solution in the presence of oxygen (usually from the air or injected air). These same temperatures may make enhanced in-situ leaching practical even without the thermophiles because in situ leach can be performed at elevated pressures that accelerate the leach reactions without the need for thermophiles. Some enriched air would need to be injected into the in-situ leach area and/or into the leach solution in the injection well delivering the leach solution to the ore to make it work. Alternatively, the lixivant glycine in an alkaline oxygenated solution has been shown to leach copper from chalcopyrite ore at high copper extractions at temperatures between 20-60oC in recent research (circa 2017 at Curtin University in Australia).

To have this decision-making process in the hands of one person seems unwise and, to some extent, unfair to the person having to make those decisions. There needs to be some clarity on how these decisions are to be made. What criteria will be used? How does this person decide on what impact is acceptable and what is not?

The GPO should be amended to reflect the existing and current forest plan, not the other way around as is stated in the DEIS.
If the current forest plan requires amendment due to updated standards and guidelines, those amendments should be carried out independent of the Resolution GPO."
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","It is understood that the Forest Service cannot just say no to the project, and must select a preferred alternative with its associated impacts and the mitigation measures, if any. However, there is some room for putting the onus on Resolution to provide robust and safe mitigations in place without regard to what is reasonable. If we must speak of reasonableness, is it reasonable to destroy a 1.8-mile diameter area around Oak Flat? If there is no other reasonable way to extract the ore body, then maybe the project itself is unreasonable. If we require mitigation measures that cost Resolution so much money that it makes the project non-viable, so be it, but that decision is in the hands of Resolution. It is not our responsibility to ensure the project is viable. It is our responsibility to protect the environment and the people, flora, and fauna that live in that environment.
In Appendix F, page F-3 under “Reasonableness of Alternative Mining Techniques”, Item 2, it is stated that “While several underground stoping techniques could physically and technically be applied to the deposit, the ore and host rock characteristics typically favorable for these techniques differ from the characteristics of the Resolution Copper Mine deposit. While physically feasible, it is unlikely that any of these techniques would be chosen as a reasonable technique for a similar deposit”.
There’s that word reasonable again. Who decides what is reasonable in this case? Is it reasonable to permanently alter the Oak Flat area forever or is it more reasonable to find alternate methods of extracting that ore that do not have that impact, but may be more expensive? It would appear that the issue here is not whether a stoping method is physically feasible or what is or is not reasonable, but rather that it is costs too much money. This is an economic issue, pure and simple. Resolution Copper stands to realize a great deal of profit over the life of this proposed mine and it is reasonable to require them to leave Oak Flat as it is, by using a mining technique that is feasible."
"3.9.03","Recreation: Mitigation","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","the bouldering in and around Oak Flat, as well as the roped sport climbing in the Queen Creek area in general is considered world class. People from around the world travel here to climb. The economic loss of those visitors is an impact to Superior and the area.
The loss of thousands of boulder problems and dozens of roped sport climbing routes is a huge impact to this historic recreational use in the area. Mitigation measures must include providing alternate areas that have yet to be developed, as well as providing access to areas that will not be directly affected, but access to them is.
Providing an area known as the Inconceivables and access to it is a good start. How many boulder problems does this area represent? Is it anywhere close to the thousands lost in the Oak Flats area? I suspect it does not. More areas are necessary to replace the loss of Oak Flats. It is suggested that additional areas be identified, with the help of Queen Creek Coalition, and secure access to these areas.
Forest Road #315 is to be closed from the North due to mining activity. This road provides access to Lower Devil’s Canyon and climbing areas known as The Glitter Box and Hackberry Creek, though there are others as well. Forest Road #315 does extend to the South and provides access to these areas, but the road itself is very rugged, and nearly impassible to all except the most ardent four wheelers out there. At the very least, we should require that Forest Road #315 be improved from the South to these climbing areas in order to make them accessible. A maintenance plan, with associated funds, should also be included.
Other climbing areas will be impacted as well. Upper Devil’s Canyon in particular may not be directly impacted by mining activity, but it appears that the existing access to this climbing area will be lost. Resolution should be required to provide alternate access once the existing road (old US60) is shut down.
In addition, rock stability is of concern. See Comments #17, #23, and #24 below. [SEE COMMENT LETTER]
Also, an area known as The Mine Area could continue to be used as long as access is provided from the North on rerouted Magma Mine Road, but outside any secured areas and the subsidence zone.
Again, underlying these suggestions for mitigating impact is the notion that there are impacts that are acceptable and those that are not. The complete loss of Oak Flat is not acceptable. An alternate mining method that does not involve such utter devastation is necessary. If that makes the project unviable, then the project is unviable."

"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","In most or even all alternatives, it appears that Resolution Copper will be using a great deal of water for tailings transport. In the Southwest US, this high volume of water use seems unwise. Filtered tailings, or dry stacked tailings, is considered for only one alternative. Here are some pros and cons of dry stacking found in a quick internet search:
Like with thickened and paste tailings, the mechanical dewatering process compared to conventional slurry deposition increases costs. Producing wet and dry cake further increases this cost particularly if high throughputs are required
However, some of the many advantages to using dry stacking of tailings are:
• Can be used in areas where water conservation is critical. Water conservation is very critical in Central Arizona and anything that can be done to conserve this precious resource should be done.
• Risks of catastrophic failure and tailings runout is reduced or even eliminated if the facility is operated as intended. This would reduce the possible impacts from failure in all alternative locations.
• Dry stacking is suited to areas of high seismic activity as the construction of retention embankments is prevented.
• Suitable where there is limited construction material available to develop a conventional retention impoundment.
• Progressive rehabilitation is possible, spreading the cost of closure over a longer time period when compared to conventional storage facilities. This seems like a benefit to Resolution Copper.
• Higher rates of rise can be achieved due to the high dense state of the placed tailings when compared to conventionally deposited tailings. Access by mechanical equipment to provide spreading and compaction is also advantageous.
• For cold climates, dry stacking prevents pipe freezes and frosting problems with conventional impoundments. It is recognized that this is not an issue in Central Arizona.
• Groundwater contamination through seepage is virtually eliminated. This is a major benefit to this type of tailings deposition.
• Filtered tailings allow better recovery of dissolved metals and process chemicals (e.g. gold and cyanide).
Dry stack facilities are also easier to close and rehabilitate, require a smaller footprint compared to other surface tailings storage options (i.e. higher density), can be utilized in aggressive environments (e.g. undulating and steep terrain).
Some of the disadvantages to dry stack tailings are as follows:
• High capital and operating costs associated with modern filtration technology (power, maintenance) that render other tailings storage options more economic to develop. An analysis of water costs versus power costs might prove to be quite persuasive in this case.
• Only really suited to low throughput operations (currently around 20,000 tpd) due to equipment costs and operational management of a large filtration plant. This is a major disadvantage for Resolution Copper.
• Upstream diversion systems required to prevent inundation of the dry stack facility. But, this is offset by not requiring elaborate seepage control systems.
• Surface contour management required to prevent accumulation and easy removal of surface water (i.e. precipitation events) to prevent ponding and erosion of the stack through channelized runoff flow channels.
• No option to store water within a dry stack facility. A conventional tailings facility, designed to store water, can provide a mining operation with a buffer (e.g. storm water storage) to maintain operations during dry months of the year. Nearly all the water to be used in this instance is pumped groundwater, so this disadvantage is of no consequence for Resolution Copper.
• Oxidation of sulphides in the tailings can create high concentrations (but low volume) of seepage water. May not be practical for some ore types. Detailed geochemical testing is required.
• Dust generation is a common problem in arid climates and can occur relatively quickly after tailings disposal due to the low moisture content of the placed material. It is recognized that this is an issue for Central Arizona.
• A dry stack installation in a high rainfall environment can create day-to-day management problems for trafficability of haulage and compaction equipment. Seasonal fluctuations are an important consideration in the design of a dry stack facility. Again, this is not an issue in Central Arizona.
However, it should be noted that the economics associated with implementing tailings filtration systems have decreased rapidly over the last 5 years. This is mainly due to the increase in capacity of modern filtration systems (e.g. increased filtration area of horizontal filtration belts) and operational optimization such as minimized blinding of filter cloths.
An analysis of dry stacking versus more conventional tailings storage for all alternatives should be included in the DEIS."

An underground tunnel already exists from the #9 shaft to the West Plant Site, and I understand that Resolution has inherited a problem with that tunnel (Neversweat) in that it intercepts groundwater that would normally flow under Queen Creek. A new tunnel could possibly add to this issue, depending on its location.
While the DEIS does not seek to remedy existing issues not connected to the proposed mine, the protection of Queen Creek is of utmost concern. Resolution should provide assurances that the new tunnel, if the plan is to build one, does not add to an already unacceptable situation. If Resolution intends on using the existing tunnel, then a remedy for the existing issue should be included in the mine plan, and outlined in the DEIS.
Further, the existing situation is untenable. Resolution, in an effort to dewater shafts #9 and #10 are pumping water through the Neversweat Tunnel and the intercepted water is being gathered up as well and delivered to NMIDD. This water is not theirs. It should be gathered up and returned to Queen Creek, where it would have ended up had the Neversweat Tunnel not caused extensive fracturing in Queen Creek."

In contacting the SUSD, the Superintendent informed me that “based on the AZ school funding equalization formula, the District would not receive any additional funding as a result of the Land Exchange. The area is within District boundaries. I believe the mine would devalue our property and absorb that tax burden. Superior would probably have one of the lowest school property levies in the State. I would consider the mill levy the tax revenue of the mine itself and everything it produces. Saddle Brook School District is a good example. The Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant is within its boundaries. It does not receive any additional tax revenue because of it. The school property tax is one of the lowest in the state. It’s definitely not a fair system. The school would receive more funding if our student population did increase. However, being that Superior lacks housing, that may not happen as well. “
Table 3.13.4-2 on page 651 shows projected revenue for the Superior Union School District of $19,238,311 (low estimate) to $30,087,882 (high estimate). Based on the Superintendent’s response, the low estimate should be $0.
I do not understand what the mill levy is, nor the school finance equalization formula, but to report $20 million to $30 million in additional revenues to SUSD as a result of this mine, is misleading,.
It is suggested that this portion of the DEIS be completely rewritten to reflect reality and to explain in more depth how this $30 million figure is derived. It should also explain that it is highly unlikely to be realized."

this is to the benefit of Superior. But, if the costs are more than the increased revenue, even if small, the impact on this small community can be disastrous.

This is consistent with NDAA Sec. 3003 (i) (1) (B) (ii). There is also a possibility that the land exchange might be repealed by legislative action.
There are at least two instances where the Draft EIS incorrectly implies that mining at Oak Flat could be allowed even if the land exchange does not take place. The first such instance is in Section 2.2.3.1 page 66 which states ”It is possible that mining under the proposed action or action alternatives could also take place without the land exchange occurring. - - - -“.

Such mining would be in direct violation of two Public Land Orders. The first is Public Land Order 1229 issued by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955, which withdrew 760 acres at Oak Flat Picnic and Camp Ground “from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws, including the mining but not the mineral-leasing laws”. The second is Public Land Order 5132 issued by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971 which modifies Public Land Order 1229 “to the extent necessary to open the following described lands (including Oak Flat) to all forms of appropriation under the public land laws applicable to national forest lands, except under the U.S. mining laws.”.
Therefore, the EIS must be modified to reference the two Public Land Orders and explicitly state that in accordance with current laws mining under the proposed or alternative actions would NOT be allowed at Oak Flat without the land exchange."
"LE01","Land Exchange: General ","LE","Land Exchange","The “Dear Reader” letter preceding the Draft EIS mentions some of the key events at the end of the NEPA process, and their timing. However the EIS itself is not concerned with the timing of those parts of the NEPA process that occur after completion of the EIS. Unfortunately, beyond 60 days after the Final EIS is published, objections to the Final EIS that are related to the transferred land will be meaningless, since the land exchange will have taken place. It would be very useful for the EIS, the objections, the objection process, and the ROD to all be fully documented in a public record before the land exchange takes place. This information would complete the picture of the entire NEPA process for this project, and could be important in any subsequent litigation that might ensue concerning the land exchange.
Various documents use different wording to define the timing of the EIS and the land exchange, such as “publication” of the Final EIS, “completion” of the EIS, “release” of the Final EIS and “finalize” the EIS. NDAA Sec. 3003 (c) (10) Title Transfer states “Not later than 60 days after the date of publication of the final environmental impact statement, the Secretary shall convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Federal land to Resolution Copper.” Therefore, I recommended that the term “publication” be used to consistently denote the event that triggers the land exchange.
The NEPA process requires a minimum 30 day period from publication of the Final EIS until issuance of the ROD. During this time objections to the Final EIS can be submitted. NDAA Sec. 3003 requires that the land exchange be executed within a maximum of 60 days after publication of the Final EIS.
A 2018 report by the Council on Environmental Quality,
https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CEQ-EIS-Timelines-Report.pdf,
shows that the average time from completion of the Final EIS until issuance of a ROD is 5 months for all government agencies and 3.2 months for the USFS. This report mentions the “EIS Process” which includes the issuance of the ROD.
If the time from publication of the Final EIS, with the addendum containing comments, until issuance of the ROD were anything greater than 60 days, then the ROD would not be issued until after execution of the land exchange. Thus the preparation of the final EIS should assure that all necessary information is in place for the ROD to be issued no more than 60 days following publication of the final EIS. This could impose tight limits on the time allocated for the objection process. It also means that, to minimize objections, all comments on the Draft EIS must be carefully addressed during preparation of the Final EIS."

Of course, the cost of facilities and infrastructure needed to support the tailings disposal are

In the absence of such data an appraisal of the affected land should be done to establish the present value of an investment stream that investors would be willing to make in the land if it were not being used for tailings disposal."
"3.13.01","Socioeconomics: General","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","As pointed out in my July 2016 scoping comments (submitted using name C. Gene McCormick), although tailings dams are supposedly a “mature” technology (in use for about 100 years), their overall failure rates have been about 1/1000 per year, or a 5% chance that any tailings dam will fail in 50 years. So the history of tailings dams shows them to be cheap, dangerous, and unreliable.
Section 3.10.1 of the Draft EIS, “Tailings and Pipeline Safety”, discusses tailings dam failures, and on page 519 states that the average release from a typical failure has been about one third of the facility capacity. The Draft EIS mentions the Mount Polley (in 2014) and Fundao (in 2015) tailings dam failures that each released about 20 to 30 million cubic meters. A more recent example is the catastrophic failure on Jan. 25, 2019 at Brumadinho, Brazil, which released only about 11 million cubic meters of tailings, but caused hundreds of fatalities and extensive damage. Table 3.10.1-6 of the Draft EIS shows that the estimated releases for a failure of the alternatives of the proposed Resolution Copper Mine would be substantially greater than any of these.
The Forest Service Guide for Reclamation Bond Estimation and Administration of 2004 indicates that bonding covers only the cost of tailings dam construction, but not potential liabilities incurred by tailings dam failures. This means that the cost of damage, injury, or death caused downstream by a tailings dam failure could be a burden placed on the public. Therefore the expected value of such cost, accounting for the likelihood of dam failure, is an important economic impact.
The Draft EIS presents quite a bit of information on tailings dam standards and practices, and on vulnerable downstream objects, and In Section 3.10.1.2 the Draft EIS summarizes risk analysis methods for tailings storage facilities. However the Draft EIS does not state the probability of failure or the expected costs of dam failure for each of the alternatives.
The Final EIS must present an analysis of the expected value of the cost of damage to downstream communities, populations, water supplies, and riparian areas. This should account for the probability of failure for the type of dam and type of tailings for each alternative. If failure probability data specific to each alternative is not available, then the overall failure probability for tailings dams should be used for a worst case analysis. This analysis should make use of available hydrological models for predicting downstream flows produced by tailings dam failures."

This depression is shown between points A and B on the following image.[SEE COMMENT LETTER FOR IMAGE]
The BGC Engineering (2018a) report appears to thoroughly identify all of the known faults in the proximity of the proposed mine, and indicates that the Gant or West Boundary faults are close to Apache Leap SMA. Figure 3 of the BGC report indicates that core sampling is very sparse in the area west of the proposed mine, resulting in uncertain data on rock characteristics used in subsidence modeling. The BGC report concludes “ - - - - Therefore, the DEIS should fully disclose these areas of uncertainty, areas of sparse or missing data, and that actual surface subsidence could vary from the modeled results.” . The DEIS partially satisfies this recommendation by referring to uncertainties, but must be modified to mention that the uncertainty is much greater in the area near Apache Leap SMA."
"IA01","Issues Analysis: Proposed New Issue","IA","Issues Analysis","Air blast was a topic that I suggested in Section 1.2 of my comments submitted in July 2016 for scoping of the EIS. This topic was completely missing from the GPO at that time, and now seems to be ignored in the DEIS, except for a passing reference in connection with backfill in Appendix F.
Air blast is well known as a hazard in block caving. The air blast and associated fatalities that occurred at the Northparkes Mine in Australia in November 1999 led to a number of lessons learned, recommendations, and procedures to help prevent air blast. Precautions, such as air gap monitoring and control, that must be followed to help prevent air blast, are well known and documented, for example in the “Cave Mining Handbook”. Also in recent years new computer modeling techniques for air blast prediction have been developed.
The EIS must describe air blast as a potential environmental impact, and must specify mandatory procedures as a mitigation to help prevent air blast. These procedures must be a part of an integrated Subsidence Management Plan, discussed below in Section 4.3, and must include appropriate use of available air blast prediction technology."
"3.2.07","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Mitigation","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","The Draft EIS, Section 3.2.4.9, page 159, states “ - - - - However, as subsidence has the potential to affect Tonto National Forest surface resources, particularly within the Apache Leap SMA, the Forest Service will require that a final subsidence monitoring plan be completed and approved by the Forest Service prior to signing a decision. - - - -“. What is referred to in the Draft EIS as a “subsidence monitoring plan” probably means the “Subsidence Management Plan” previously included as an appendix of the GPO.
The Subsidence Management Plan should specify methods of subsidence mitigation, and as such should have been available for public review as part of the Draft EIS. Unfortunately this deficiency has already occurred, but since the land exchange will take place within 60 days after publication of the Final EIS, the Subsidence Management Plan must be completed, reviewed, and approved no later than the publication of the Final EIS. This is needed to assure that the land exchange does not take place until Apache Leap SMA is protected with a Final Subsidence Management Plan that has been completed, reviewed, and approved."
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","The alternatives presented in the Draft EIS differ from one another with regard to tailings disposal, principally 1) the facility location, 2) the type of tailings, and 3) the design of the tailings retention structure ( upstream, downstream, PAG, NPAG, etc.). This means that there’s a 3 dimensional matrix of options to be considered for the alternatives. Chapters 2 and 3 of the Draft EIS describe many of the pieces of this puzzle, but say little about the procedures and methods needed to assemble them into a preferred alternative.
The Draft EIS in places states some of the rationale for the choice of alternatives, for example in Section 2.2.6 Alternative 4 it states “The rationale for choosing this alternative for detailed analysis is that, compared with the proposed action, it allows for a comparison of the impacts of thickened slurry tailings vs. filtered tailings, and it allows a comparison regarding whether the specific location selected for tailings in the GPO is preferable to other locations in the same general vicinity of Superior”. However, that comparison is not presented in the Draft EIS.
Currently dry stack/filtered tailings are gaining much greater acceptance and use in the mining industry as a more sustainable, safer method of tailings disposal. The Draft EIS does not indicate why filtered tailings were considered only for Alternative 4 and not for the preferred alternative. The discussion of Draft EIS Section 2.2.6 Alternative 4 simply states “ - - - Filtered tailings would allow progressive reclamation and compaction, but this alternative has large, dry, exposed surfaces that need to be managed to avoid air quality concerns. At this time, filtered tailings have not been used on a facility with a production rate as high as that proposed by Resolution Copper.” However the Draft EIS gives no information on the feasibility of methods for protecting the large surfaces, or the feasibility of implementing a large filtering facility. There is no reason given why a number of smaller filtering plants could not be used in parallel to achieve the required output. This indicates that filtered tailings were not given adequate consideration in the Draft EIS, and the Final EIS must give this technology a much more thorough and comprehensive treatment.
The Draft EIS needs revision to provide a summary, possibly a table that brings together the impacts for all of the alternatives, preferably with weighting that represents the relative importance of each impact. This should include the public monetary costs of tailings disposal as discussed in Section 3 of these comments. The preferred alternative would likely use filtered tailings because of water use, required land area, and tailings disposal public costs including much lower expected costs of dam failure."
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Using filtered tailings as surface backfill in the subsidence area has obvious advantages with respect to land use, water requirements, tailings disposal public costs, and returning the topography of the subsidence area closer to its natural condition.
The Draft EIS in Appendix F dismisses the use of filtered tailings as surface backfill with little justification other than the following summary statement: “This option was dismissed for safety concerns, both above ground and below ground. In panel caving, it is paramount to control the rate of panel caving and prevent air gaps from developing above the caved zone, which can lead to potentially catastrophic air blasts. Loading of tailings above the panel cave operation could change the rock dynamics in unexpected and unknown ways. If it involves slurry, the added aspect of drainage from above further complicates mining operations. Safety hazards exist for personnel placing tailings above ground as well, given the active subsidence and earth movement. Overall, it was determined that this option represented unreasonable safety hazards and did not conform to industry norms.” Most people would agree that using slurry as surface backfill would not be feasible. (Note also that this is the only place in the Draft EIS where the possibility of air blast is even mentioned).
The above statement is an almost verbatim replica of the conclusions reached by the USFS Alternatives Development Project Team in a workshop held on April 11 & 12, 2017, as reported by SWCA in the report “Resolution Copper Project and Land Exchange Environmental Impact Statement Draft Alternatives Evaluation Report” (SWCA Environmental Consultants 2017a).
So the dismissal of an alternative that uses rapidly advancing technology to achieve tremendous potential benefits was apparently based entirely on discussions held as part of a 2-day workshop. The statement “Loading of tailings above the panel cave operation could change the rock dynamics in unexpected and unknown ways” indicates that little or no consideration was given to the subsidence prediction techniques discussed in Section 2.3.2 of the Draft EIS and in Section 4 of these comments. The SWCA report gives no indication of why the Project Team might have felt that such techniques are inadequate. Section 2.2 of my scoping comments submitted in July 2016 recommended studying the feasibility of backfill using filtered tailings. Such a study should have been done and the results presented in the Draft EIS instead of dismissing it with the above brief statement.
I again recommend that a study be conducted to determine the feasibility of placing filtered tailings as backfill on the surface of the subsidence area. This could possibly be an extension of the BGC Engineering (2018a) report discussed in Section 4 of these comments and in Section 2.3.2 of the Draft EIS. This study should determine whether it is practical to design a schedule and a pattern of
tailings deposition that would keep the deposition process separated by sufficient distance and time from the surface movement associated with caving. The study should be able use a model such as FLAC3D to iteratively determine the subsidence from successive depositions. The depositions might start directly over the point where mining commences and then move outward. It might be reasonable to deposit the tailings in the area outward of the most recently predicted boundary between the fracture and continuous subsidence zones. The study should determine the feasibility of using automated earth moving equipment to eliminate safety hazards for personnel. This would be consistent with the heavy reliance that the proposed mining operation already places on automation for its underground operations. The study should also consider covering the disturbed area during reclamation with topsoil salvaged prior to caving. The processes covered by this study are sufficiently complex, with substantial computational work, to demand more than a cursory evaluation.
If backfill using filtered tailings proves feasible, and also becomes the preferred alternative, then considerable revision of the GPO would be required. Of course the USFS will have no jurisdiction over the Oak Flat Federal Parcel after the land exchange takes place. However, the selection of surface backfill with filtered tailings as the preferred alternative could make Forest Service lands, and possibly other federal lands, unavailable to RCM for tailings disposal."

On top of that the testers at AzGS drilled dozens of test holes to test saturation, air pressure, so they added another level of porous conduits in the volcanic tuff.

This Tuff was studied in the 1990’s because Government agencies and contractors were looking for sites to store nuclear waste. They wanted to test if a lava tuff would be a good place to store it and how much a lava tuff would hold since it is porous. Tests were conducted on Apache Leap tuff a as test case for the proposed underground nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.

I question the following statement within the Notice of Intent issued in March 2016: “ […] the responsible official—the Forest Supervisor, Tonto National Forest—does not have discretion to select the no action alternative, because it would not be consistent with the requirements of 36 CFR 228.5, nor would it comply with the NDAA” (page ES-10). The main definition of discretion is “individual choice or judgment” or “the power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice”. Therefore, the statement that Neil Bosworth, the Forest Supervisor, does not have discretion to select the no action alternative assumes that Neil Bosworth or any Forest Supervisor does not have free will, an assumption that I question. Even a cursory review of US history and present day situations shows that legal requirements are not always ethical, nor are they always in the best interest of the public or environment.

3. Under 2.2.3.1 Need for Inclusion of Land Exchange in Document, a revision to the 1st sentence of the concluding paragraph: The first combination was not carried forward as the Forest Service employee chose to follow legal regulations; however, they can still prioritize the health and safety of Arizona residents and the concerns of Tribes over fear of legal consequences, and refuse approval of the GPO; or resign in opposition to the Resolution Copper Project and Land Exchange."

"NP01","NEPA: Public Comment Period","NP","NEPA Process"," Public Outreach • There were no postings about the Resolution Copper Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) being available for public review and comment posted at Oak Flat Campground on Sunday, November 3rd, 2019; during the public scoping comment period on the DEIS. Due to this, I believe that the scoping period should be re-done. People who use the Oak Flat campground are extremely important stakeholders in this process! It was unbelievable to see an almost empty signage board without notice of this project during the open public comment period, as this project will take away the campground from public use in the future (see images below). o The people who camp here are the very people who may be able to provide the most insight about the area and have ideas for mitigation related to offsetting impacts to recreational opportunities in this area. o At any city or town, if an area was going to be re-zoned, there would need to be a formal huge sign posted at the front of the property. That should have happened for this project as well. I am surprised that neither the USFS Forest Service planners nor the consultant planners considered posting signs there as a requirement related to public outreach. One of the first things urban and environmental planners learn in school is the importance of public outreach and reaching stakeholders. Not only was this a missed opportunity, I see it as a violation of having a clear and transparent public scoping outreach process and should therefore be re-done. A sign with information about the project, how to get signed up for notifications and when to comment should be added to the campground as soon as possible. • The online comment form should include an option for a person to be anonymous. Instead there is an asterisk that the first and last name are required; this is not right and should be corrected. • It would also be a better practice for people to receive an automatic response when their comment is received. It could say, “Thank you for your comment. We appreciate your feedback and valuable input on this project. Due to the high volume of comments received, it may take us some time to respond to your comment. Below is a copy of the comment you have submitted”. • Why is the Tonto National Forest not using the most up-to-date GovDelivery system and keeping people on the contact list more in the loop on what is going on? Using the new system may have given adequate notice to people on the scoping contact list about this project. I barely received any email communication about this project and I signed up to be on the contact list years ago, when the first public meetings were held. I received one postcard only a few days before the Tempe public meeting, which means that I do not think they got the postcards out in enough time per federal law and NEPA regulations. Plus, I never received a postcard about the original public hearings. The U.S. Forest Service did not use the most up-to-date communication method to interact with the public on this project; therefore, the public scoping comment period on the Draft EIS should be re-done. • I want to thank the U.S. Forest Service for holding a public hearing in Tempe, which I was able to attend and speak at. Why were more public hearings not held in the Phoenix and Tucson and Flagstaff areas? I have friends from Tucson who go rock climbing at Oak Flat and they were not able to attend any hearings. At least one would have been nice. The room at the Tempe location was absolutely not adequate, and I hope no one left because they could not find parking. Public meetings are often held at schools in the gymnasium, auditorium or cafeteria. It was not a big enough room; and the Forest Service should have known that for a controversial project. There was not enough done to let the general public know about this project and about the public hearings. There should be more than just the minimal amount of public outreach done for a project of this scale and controversy. • I have also not been able to find a place where I can read the Draft EIS printed. I am wondering why copies of the draft EIS have not been made available at certain libraries or other locations near Superior, Phoenix and Tucson. I have tried to print it myself and it only prints at a half-page. This is an issue for older people who may have vision problems. • I was surprised there was not an email address I could send my comment to. For most large NEPA projects I have seen a project specific email address created."

"3.9.03","Recreation: Mitigation","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","Recreation • The adverse recreational impacts will be irreversible. As such, I think that in addition to mitigation proposed in the DEIS, Resolution Copper could: o Develop new trails throughout the new parcels from the land exchange, as well as additional campgrounds that should be free for the general public to use. o Resolution Copper could pay for a new town park in Superior and perhaps in other nearby towns that are impacted. o Resolution Copper should help to pay for restroom facilities at all of the new land exchange parcels, especially since the Oak Flat campground had restroom facilities. o Resolution Copper could pay for a new indoor pool facility and instructors and staff that would serve an area from Gold Canyon to Globe while the mine is in operation and reclamation. I know from working in small rural communities that this is often an amenity they lack and need. Children are not learning how to swim. Helping children learn to swim can have positive impacts to public health and safety, and as this project is going to impact that too, a pool and instructors teaching children to swim could at least help them be safe when in water. o There is no equal trade-off, this project will have irreversible adverse consequences to rock climbing and trails near Oak Flat and Devil’s Canyon.  There are other examples where creating a new recreational facility was constructed due to adverse environmental and social impacts. For example, Margaret T. Hance Park in downtown Phoenix was constructed (above the Interstate 10 deck park tunnel) in order to mitigate impacts from destruction of historic homes during construction of the I-10.  The developer of the new Cubs stadium in Mesa helped to build the new Mesa Riverview Park that has an amazing rope climbing structure for kids, trails, and a pond for fishing, in exchange for using Mesa’s land to build their new stadium. A similar approach could be taken for this project.  Resolution Copper could pay to have rock climbing structures installed throughout existing parks in small towns in the area from Gold Canyon to Globe. Even though fake, they would be great for kids to climb and practice on. Perhaps new climbing structures could be added to elementary and middle school playgrounds in these towns, the ones that look like real rocks. "

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","A. The DEIS does not address whether Resolution Copper’s unpatented mining claims underneath Tonto National Forest land surface are valid. On July 31, 2019, the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona, issued a decision, Center for Biological Diversity v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, holding that the Forest Service, in failing to consider whether a mining company possessed valid unpatented mining claims before it approved the company’s mining plan of operations, violated its duty to protect National Forest lands from depredation and preserve them from destruction. The court held that the Forest Service’s approval of the mining plan was unlawful and set aside the decision and underlying NEPA analysis. The DEIS here does not clearly identify whether Resolution Copper’s mining plan relies on surface occupancy of unpatented mining claims that have not been validated. While a portion of the mine’s footprint would be on surface lands that Resolution Copper would own after completion of the land exchange, it appears that operations would extend beyond the 2,422-acre Oak Flat Federal Parcel onto Tonto National Forest lands on which Resolution Copper (and other parties) hold unpatented mining claims. If that is the case under at least some of the alternatives, the DEIS does not address whether those unpatented claims have been validated. Given the Center for Biological Diversity decision, the Forest Service cannot approve a plan of operations for Resolution Copper that entails surface use of National Forest land without confirming Resolution Copper’s mining claims are valid."
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","B. The DEIS failed to consider reasonable alternative mining methods that would not result in the destruction of Oak Flat. NEPA requires federal agencies to “rigorously explore and objectively evaluate” a range of alternatives to proposed federal actions. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.14(a), 1508.25(c). “An agency must look at every reasonable alternative, with the range dictated by the nature and scope of the proposed action.” Nw. Envtl. Defense Center v. Bonneville Power Admin., 117 F.3d 1520, 1538 (9th Cir. 1997). An agency violates NEPA by failing to “rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives” to the proposed action. City of Tenakee Springs v. Clough, 915 F.2d 1308, 1310 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14). This evaluation extends to considering more environmentally protective alternatives and mitigation measures. See, e.g., Kootenai Tribe of Idaho v. Veneman, 313 F.3d 1094, 1122–23 (9th Cir. 2002) (and cases cited therein). The consideration of more environmentally protective alternatives is also consistent with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act’s (FLPMA) requirement that BLM “minimize adverse impacts on the natural, environmental, scientific, cultural, and other resources and values (including fish and wildlife habitat) of the public lands involved.” 43 U.S.C. §1732(d)(2)(a). Further, in defining what is a “reasonable” range of alternatives, NEPA requires consideration of alternatives “that are practical or feasible” and not just “whether the proponent or applicant likes or is itself capable of carrying out a particular alternative”; in fact, “[a]n alternative that is outside the legal jurisdiction of the lead agency must still be analyzed in the EIS if it is reasonable.” Council on Environmental Quality, Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, Questions 2A and 2B, available at https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/G-CEQ-40Questions.pdf; 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.14,1506.2(d). Here, although the Forest Service evaluated five action alternatives, none of them included alternative mining methods to the block-caving method proposed by Resolution Copper. Given the cultural and religious importance of Oak Flat to the 11 consulted Tribes, as well as the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provision requiring the Forest Service to seek to find “mutually acceptable measures to address the concerns of the affected Indian Tribes . . . and minimize the adverse effects on the affected Indian Tribes resulting from mining and related activities on the Federal land conveyed to Resolution Copper” the agency had an obligation under NEPA to evaluate an alternative in which Resolution Copper would use a different ore extraction method. This is the case even if one assumes, for the sake of argument, that the Forest Service has no choice but to complete the land exchange described in the NDAA, for an obligation to complete the exchange does not create an obligation to permit a certain mining method."
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," C. The DEIS fails to document how several critical Groundwater Modeling Workgroup determinations were made. A primary concern regarding the Resolution Copper proposal is that the mine has the potential to contaminate area groundwater and lower the groundwater table for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. The DEIS notes that the Forest Service greatly relied on a Groundwater Modeling Workgroup it convened to review the work done on groundwater modeling by Resolution Copper contractors, and assist the Service in determining appropriate methodologies and approaches. Given the significance of possible groundwater impacts it is imperative that the Forest Service document the process it and the Workgroup used to evaluate the groundwater modeling and reach conclusions. However, the thought and process that went into decisions regarding precision level and time frame for groundwater modeling are not provided in the DEIS; instead the decisions are described as “based on combined professional judgement.” DEIS, 300, 301. Given that Resolution Copper contractors prepared the model, the Forest Service has an obligation to show the Workgroup’s reasoning in its decisions regarding precision and time frame. "
"CU02","Cumulative: RFFA - Reasonably Foreseeable Future Activities","CU","Cumulative"," The DEIS’s cumulative impacts analysis improperly neglected to consider the proposed Ray Mine expansion. In the DEIS the Forest Service acknowledges BLM has proposed a land exchange with ASARCO that would enable expansion of the Ray Mine, but asserts numerous times that ‘no details are currently available as to potential environmental effects resulting from this possible future mining operation.’ This is disingenuous, as BLM has published a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) that documents likely impacts of mine expansion subsequent to the land exchange. Although no plan of operations has been approved for a Ray Mine expansion, the FSEIS analysis offers sufficient information to provide a discussion of its cumulative impacts on the project area for the Resolution Copper proposal. The Forest Service cannot avoid its duty to analyze the foreseeable cumulative impacts of the Ray Mine expansion by claiming that “no details are currently available as to potential environmental effects” when the FSEIS for the Ray Land Exchange is currently available.

"MIT01","Mitigation: General","MIT","Mitigation"," The DEIS should not have been published until a mitigation plan was completed. NEPA requires that mitigation measures are discussed with specificity in an EIS. 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.14, 1502.16. Simply identifying mitigation measures, without analyzing the effectiveness of the measures, violates NEPA. Agencies must “analyze the mitigation measures in detail [and] explain how effective the measures would be. . . A mere listing of mitigation measures is insufficient to qualify as the reasoned discussion required by NEPA.” Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n v. Peterson, 764 F.2d 581, 588 (9th Cir. 1985), rev’d on other grounds, 485 U.S. 439 (1988). NEPA also directs that the “possibility of mitigation” should not be relied upon as a means to avoid further environmental analysis. Council on Environmental Quality, Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, available at https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/G-CEQ-40Questions.pdf; Davis v. Mineta, 302 F.3d at 1125. Further, general statements from an agency that it will conduct monitoring are not an appropriate form of mitigation. Simply monitoring for expected damage does not actually reduce or alleviate impacts. While it seems the Forest Service intends to provide a mitigation plan when it publishes a Final EIS for the Resolution Copper proposal, it should have provided a detailed plan and estimated costs for mitigation in the Draft EIS. The public deserves an opportunity to evaluate and comment on whether the necessary mitigation is likely to be completed at sufficient scale and within a sufficient time frame. "

"3.7.03","Water Resources: Water Quantity (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Resolution's proposed withdrawal of water for mining operations from wells to be drilled along the MARRCO (Magma Arizona Railroad Company) rail corridor is estimated to range from 180,000 AF to as much as 600,000 AF over the LOM. Resolution has stored and/or obtained Long-Term Storage Credits (LTSCs) for approximately 313,000 AF of Central Arizona Project (CAP) water, of which approximately 256,000 AF ai·e located within the Phoenix Active Management Area (AMA). However, the location along the rail corridor where Resolution proposes to withdraw the water is outside the area of hydrologic impact (AOI) where the water storage occurred. Therefore, the local aquifer in the central portion of the SVP A, and not the one(s) where the storage occurred, will be the aquifer impacted by Resolution's proposed withdrawals. In terms of a 100-year Assured Water Supply (A WS), the water represents the equivalent of an annual buildout demand of up to 6,000 AF per year (AFY). Resolution could partially mitigate this impact by withdrawing its 256,000 AF of Phoenix AMA L TSCs from within the AOI of storage. This would have the effect of reducing the local area impact in the central SVPA to around 3,440 AFY. Even with this mitigation, at a density of three units per acre, assuming three persons per household, and using a water demand of one AFY per acre (Source: Arizona Department of Water Resources' Fourth Management Plan models for new single-family residential development), Resolution's withdrawals, if mitigated by recovering the LTSCs from within the AOI of storage, would still potentially result in the loss of the development of at least 3,440 acres of State Trust land. State Trust land has recently been auctioned for residential development in the area near the SVP A for approximately $156,000 per acre. Therefore, even with partial mitigation, the loss of3,440 acres of developable State Trust land represents a minimum potential loss to the Trust of at least $536,640,000 in revenue."

While the reporting of the Skunk Camp inventories has not been completed, the preliminary results given to the ASLD Cultural Resources Section indicate that almost all the cultural resources in the Skunk Camp alternative consist of Classic period Salado sites. Previous research in the region has revealed that habitation sites from this time period have the potential for large numbers of human burials (for example, pa1tial excavation of Togetzoge Pueblo near Top-of-the World resulted in the recovery of 70 burials), and the numbers of sites in the Skunk Camp alternative suggests that several hundred burials could be impacted.

The Conservancy recommends repair and replacement fencing north of the Clark property et al to Hwy 77 along the river and River Road and fences on the west side of highway 77 between the highway and Camino Rio need to be repaired and/or replaced.

Several cultural sites should be fenced prior to transfer. An inventory of these sites (21) was conducted by the Center for Desert Archeology (now Archeology Southwest) in 2010 and recommendations were made that describe fencing needs to protect the sites from vehicle use and actions needed to control areas of active erosion which could cause significant damage to the sites. In places a pipe rail fence may be necessary to prevent vehicle traffic. TNC can provide the Archeology Southwest recommendations and more detailed maps upon request.

"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Much of the controversy surrounding Resolution Copper's General Plan of Operations regards the subsidence crater at Oak Flat. In the 2017 Draft Alternatives Evaluation Report and its corresponding Appendix C, as well as in the Resolution Copper DEIS, arguments are made to dismiss any and all possible alternative to Resolution Copper's preferred mining method of panel caving. Earthworks believes the general dismissal by the Forest Service of taking a hard look at these alternative mining techniques - which would leave Oak Flat intact for the numerous Native American and social groups who use the area regularly and hold it sacred - runs contrary to the intention of the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as its general role of stewards of the land recognizing a multiple use approach. 

Unfortunately, instead of taking this hard look, the Forest Service appears to have simply accepted - via SWCA Environmental Consultants -- a report from Dr. Charles Kliche entitled Technical Memorandum for Alternative Mining Methods. Dr. David Chambers, who like Dr. Kliche is also a physical engineer with 40 years of experience in mining and geotechnical engineering, contributed to the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition's comments on this topic. Had he been the chosen consultant to write about alternative mining techniques for the DEIS through SWCA, his conclusion would be vastly different than Dr. Kliche's in terms of the economic feasibility of other mining techniques. This is an indication that the Forest Service should have consulted multiple independent parties on this topic and compared findings, before simply accepting for the DEIS the conclusion of a single person and a single report, prepared by a for-profit large consultancy that likely has many ties to the mining industry. "
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","In all materials, Dr. Kliche and the Forest Service also acknowledge that alternative mining techniques are technically feasible. Cost is cited as the prohibitive factor for any technique other than panel caving-Resolution's preferred method for profit maximization. But the data provided in the DEIS and the technical memorandum is open to interpretation, and therefore needs far more detailed analysis in a revised or supplemental DEIS.  Dr. Kliche points to a study outlining underground mining operating costs in Figure 2.3- 1, using a spectrum of low, medium, and high. Neither the chart or the report elsewhere specify which factors indicate what constitutes low, medium, or high cost, or how Resolution Copper fits within the spectrum. The difference here is substantial; for block caving, figures vary from $4.53 to $20.87. The low range of room and pillar mining (a technique compatible with tailings backfill) is virtually identical to the mid-range of block caving. Without knowing where Resolution Copper stands in the range, it becomes impossible to compare costs if their ranges overlap as they do in this faulted analysis. As another example, the low range of cut and fill mining compared to the high range of block caving is very close - within 10%. The mid-range of mechanized cut and fill is actually lower than the high end of block caving. This analysis must be redone to reflect actual conditions with the Resolution ore deposit, with possible variations in the cost range analysis and methodology supported by sound, thorough research and cited as such. The analysis must also specify these costs in relation to Resolution's plan of panel caving, whereas chart 2.3-1 refers to block caving. While similar, these are considered different techniques, with different costs. Panel caving at Resolution may indeed be more expensive than block caving, rendering this chart obsolete.  It is also unclear from the materials presented in the analysis in which country these costs refer to. The cost of mining using different techniques varies by country. This analysis should have only used data from the US ( or better yet, Arizona data) to reflect costs here, not as what is likely a worldwide aggregate. Beyond this, costs should be unique to Resolution Copper, including the vast expenses possibly associated with dewatering and cooling the deposit, which as pointed out in the Coalition's comments via Dr. Steven Emerman, could make the entire project economically infeasible as planned. "
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","The Alternatives Evaluation Report indicates that Dr. Kliche was using limited information to form his analysis. Appendix C, page 1 states as much, noting that the objective of the report was to: ... develop an estimate, based on limited information provided by RCM, of the total tons of potentially mineable material above a cut-off grade of 2% which lies at or above the - 2,500 ft level 
Table 2 in Appendix C - where Dr. Kliche appears to be basing his statement about a seven-fold increase in cost -- is also flawed, because it uses a cut and fill daily production rate of I/30th that of the given block cave numbers. Economics determine that the scale of production determines the cost of production by unit. Therefore, this particular chart cannot be relied upon unless it levels the playing field with similar production rates to arrive at a cost estimate, and whether it does this or not is unclear in the materials. This chart is also not specific to Arizona, which enjoys significantly lower tax rates and operating costs than other locations which likely contributed to the data within the chart. Arizona has a major mining presence, meaning materials and labor costs are likely lower than other jurisdictions. It's also unclear whether table 2 is specific to the US or the world as a whole.
 Even if these numbers are accurate as-is, we see room and pillar mining - again a backfill compatible technique - to be only twice the cost of block caving. In our view, even if mining costs were twice that of block caving, the cost of mining technique is not fully representative of the cost of running Resolution Copper as a whole. A complete analysis would look at all costs of running the entire project, and present financial data in that context. It is possible that, as a whole, running Resolution Copper using alternative techniques may only be slightly more expensive than block caving, given all the other administrative and physical costs of running a major mine that have nothing to do with the mining technique. 
Finally, Dr. Kliche's analysis should have included a detailed summary of total extractable ore volumes under every technically feasible mining technique. It is understood generally that panel caving with 70-78 degree cave angles will render about 15% of the total ore within an ore body inaccessible, because the material between the panels will never be mined. How does this 15% compare to other methods? While Dr. Kliche includes tonnage estimates for Resolution Copper block caving using various COG' s, no comparison is given for how much ore might be extracted or not extracted using other techniques. 
This is of paramount importance, because if it can be shown that, for example, room and pillar mining can extract 75% of the ore body, versus 85% for block caving, our view is that these numbers are close enough to warrant a mandate for room and pillar mining. And if costs are actually comparable as they could be using Dr. Kliche's own chart 2.3-1, it could be the case that mining the deposit using room and pillar could only be only slightly less lucrative for the company than panel caving. Again, using the COG approach for analysis is less useful, because what matter most is 1.) how much of the ore body can be mined fully and 2.) what the actual per ton cost is using various methods. Unfortunately, Dr. Kliche's analysis does not get us to either conclusion. All we are left with are general industry figures, varying widely and often overlapping, and yet still no idea where costs actually fall with Resolution Copper, and how much of the deposit can be mined using various techniques. 
An analysis that the Forest Service is using to guide its decision whether or not to seriously consider alternative mining techniques, thereby protecting Oak Flat, cannot be based on limited information. The Forest Service must therefore perform a new analysis based on all available information unique to the Resolution Copper ore deposit, as well as operating costs specific to panel caving in the United States, and factoring in other costs unique to Resolution Copper, such as dewatering and cooling. This new analysis should use the same ore body modeling that Resolution Copper uses as it advances its own project, not information based on simple drawings of the 1% and 2% copper shells and aggregate ore body grades. 
A new, independent analysis should include the most detailed 3-dimensional data and modeling available (which Resolution Copper certainly has) because that is the data that can inform alternative mining techniques. Instead, Dr. Kliche' s report has convinced the Forest Service to entirely dismiss any alternative mining technique from consideration in the DEIS based on simple, generalized assumptions. A legitimate analysis would assess areas of higher ore grade to determine how more targeted mining techniques can access higher grade ore first, then potentially shift to other techniques later, utilizing backfill in all cases to eliminate surface subsidence. Instead, the DEIS treats all techniques as the only one that would work categorically for the entire deposit, as if all ore is homogenous.

"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Dr. Kliche refers to ""graphical information"" provided by Resolution Copper to aid in his analysis, but doesn't cite that data nor define it further. He refers to some areas of higher quality ore being further away from others, but doesn't provide the data set he used in his analysis or characterize further. He referenced his ""independent assessment of the tonnage of ore within the greater-than-2 percent shell"" but doesn't provide this analysis, instead only showing a chart with all average ore grades above a 1 % cutoff being blank. This chart refers to ""Resolution data"" but there is no explanation of what this data is or how other experts can access it."
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Regarding rock quality and ore body characteristics (table 2.3-1 and table 1 in Appendix C), Dr. Kliche has cited general data with an asterisk showing a ""match to the characteristics of the Resolution Copper ore deposit'' but doesn't cite the data he used to make these claims. In table 1, he cites information from the US Bureau of Mines from 1964 and 1982, but none of this data is specific to Resolution Copper, and it is woefully outdated. Mining techniques in 2019 and geotechnical engineering is orders of
magnitude more sophisticated than it was in 1964, and significantly better than 1982. Footnote 6 indicates data was taken from the Resolution Copper GPO, but there is no actual reference here. Footnotes appear to jump from 5 to 7, so it is unclear what this is referring to."
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Both the Alternatives Evaluation Report and the DEIS repeatedly emphasize cutoff grades (COG) for block caving. However, the cutoff grade is based on many highly dynamic factors. Dr. Kliche concludes that 80% of the ore available for milling would not be available for exploitation if any other mining technique were to be employed, because the cutoff grade would make only approximately 20% of the deposit economically viable. But how is it possible to determine this when no analysis has been performed that would evaluate specific COG' s for alternative methods, or a combination of mining techniques? Or, by not including a robust, long term market analysis that may favorably impact COG numbers over the life of the mine.
 Cutoff grades present an idea of economic feasibility using today's copper prices and operating costs, which change over time. The price of copper on November 4th, 2019 was $2.67 per pound. Had this analysis been written in 2011, when copper was $4.50 per pound, the COG would be much different, and validate alternative mining techniques more than today, because the company would be equally or more profitable despite using potentially more expensive mining techniques. As the COG shifts, so would the analysis indicating how much ore would be able to be mined profitably. 
As the world shifts to renewable energy, we expect a global increase in the price of copper, meaning Resolution Copper is positioned well to enjoy a much more favorable COG moving ahead. On the other hand, we also expect Resolution Copper and industrytied consultants like Dr. Kliche and SWCA to continue to justify the cheapest-possible mining method regardless of the COG. But until more sophisticated analysis is complete, there will be ambiguity. Dr. Kliche admits this on page 25:
 It cannot easily be known what COG would be required to break even on mining a ton of ore if the cut and-fill technique were hypothetically mandated for the Resolution Copper Project. Given that the per-ton mining costs are as much as seven times greater for cut and fill vs. panel caving, it is not unreasonable to estimate that the COG might increase from 1 percent to 2 or 3 percent. 
The above indicates that the existing analysis falls short of answering the questions the DEIS is supposed to answer, and is a vague, extrapolative statement. It should be the goal of DEIS to understand the ore body holistically, so that if alternative mining techniques were hypothetically mandated, it would be possible to understand the economics behind them. Unfortunately, Dr. Kliche and therefore the Forest Service, are admitting they are either unwilling to do the proper analysis that would determine a COG for other mining methods or a combination of them, or that the analysis might be too difficult to do. Dr. Kliche apparently had no difficulties ascertaining a COG for block caving, but apparently this is too challenging for any other method.  
"
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Dr. Kliche states that mining cost are ""as much as"" seven times greater than panel caving, even though chart 2.3-1 provides a low end range for cut and fill at $18.41 versus high end cost for block caving as $20.87. Again, without presenting costs specific to Resolution Copper, we cannot know where these ranges actually fall. The bias of Dr. Kliche is evident when he makes a statement suggesting costs are seven times higher when his own charts show cost overlaps under different scenarios, yet doesn't provide a rationale for where on the spectrum these costs may be at Resolution Copper. And again, he uses block caving figures, not panel caving, which may be different in cost."
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","As noted thoroughly in the Coalition's comments, the fact that the preferred alternative makes essentially no effort towards water conservation is extremely problematic for us. Arizona - especially southern Arizona - has no luxury to accommodate new, extraordinarily water intensive industries. It will directly compete with existing water users one way or another. We believe all alternatives should have included dry tailings disposal for this reason alone. However, in light of the tailings failures globally, particularly in Brazil and Canada in the last five years, we also remain concerned about catastrophic failures, even with centerline or downstream tailings dams.

The Forest Service and Resolution Copper have the ability to utilize dry tailings, partly because if combined with a backfill-compatible mining technique, ultimate tailings volumes could be less than half that of panel caving.

The Evaluation Report makes clear the benefits of filtered tailings: substantial water savings and the ability to stack high, and also notes the drawbacks of dust and acid generation. It is our view, however, that dust control can be achievable through concurrent reclamation that places a permanent, resilient cover over dry tails as soon as sections are complete. It may not entirely eliminate dust, but if designed properly, has the ability to significantly reduce dust.

Acid generation will eventually be problematic for any tailings impoundment at Resolution Copper designed for dry closure, as are all the alternatives in the DEIS. Arguments are made that using subaqueous tailings deposition would slow acid generation, which is true during the life of the mine, but the life of the mine is only a fraction of the time horizon involving acid generation. Since dry closure will be the reality in any case, it's our view that starting with dry tailings is by far the best option for all alternatives. Roughly 400,000 acre feet of water will be saved during the life of the mine if dry tailings are utilized, and selecting a topographically appropriate site can ensure the minimum amount of surface disturbance and visual impacts.

It is not within the scope of these comments to analyze all methodology that has led to only one alternative including dry tailings (and not the preferred alternative), or to analyze the process that led to site selection for those alternatives. But we believe that in addition to mining technique, the other biggest impact occurs from the type of tailings
disposal selected."
"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Ideally, all tailings would report to a spent open pit, or at least a different type of brown:fields site, although we understand that approach can be difficult from an engineering perspective, as well as carry serious risk to groundwater if not done properly. These comments are general; we strongly urge the Forest Service to issue a revised or supplemental DEIS that includes dry tailings in every alternative, and revisits the current rationale for eliminating brownfields sites from ultimate consideration. Perhaps brownfields sites could be partially used? Either way, between using brownfields sites to the maximum extent possible, using alternative engineering techniques to reduce tailings volume by over half via backfilling, and using dry tailings for every alternative, the amount of ultimate surface disturbance from a new tailings impoundment could be eliminated entirely or reduced to a fraction of the current proposed alternative at Skunk Camp. Unfortunately, the Forest Service has dismissed virtually all of these possibilities from further consideration."
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","The National Environmental Policy Act's intention is to provide a range of alternatives to a proposed action to reduce environmental impacts to the extent practicable. It is not the role of the Forest Service to determine what is ""reasonable"" in terms of profit margins, which is essentially what it has done in justifying the dismissal of virtually all meaningful alternatives that would vastly reduce impacts, citing cost as the only criteria.

Alternative mining techniques -which have the proven and feasible ability to completely eliminate surface subsidence at Oak Flat-is not considered in any of the alternatives, again citing cost as the reason. Yet this action would allow the Forest Service to dismiss many of the comments associated with vehement public opposition to the mine.

The DEIS in its current form fails NEPA Even though there are different places considered to place tailings, little effort is made to reduce water consumption and avoid any chance of catastrophic tailings failure, the impacts of which would be so vast as to be barely comprehensible. Surely, a tailings breach of the magnitude of Resolution Copper would be one of the worst environmental disasters in US history. Yet 5 of 6 of the alternatives do not consider filtered tailings. Water consumption is more or less the same for those 5 alternatives, even though it can be reduced dramatically.

The Forest Service is not obligated to approve whatever plan the mining company wishes, based on their prime motive of profit maximization. While we appreciate some of the changes in the DEIS over the GPO, it does not go nearly far enough under the mandates of NEPA to provide a meaningful range of alternatives to minimize impact."

Here are the specific remaining climbing crags and FS roads in question. A map attached helps locate the climbing crags and roads. Mine Area – Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and a small parking lot just outside of RCM’s mining plant for the #9 and #10 shafts. The replacement access could be a parking lot and trail at locations agreed to by the relevant parties but outside the zone of mining operations. Upper Devils Canyon – Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and the old alignment of Highway 60 that heads easterly from just north of the Oak Flat campground. This is currently designated at FR 2438 and we wish to keep this as the access to these important rock climbing crags. Lower Devils Canyon – Hackberry Creek – Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and the FR 315 that heads south from it before turning back north to the current Mining operations on top of the Leap. The replacement access QCC is requesting involves the use and improvement of USFS FR 315 that departs Highway 177 south of Superior. Apache Leap – Historical access has occurred from the top of the Leap and via Magma Mine road and FR 315 dirt road that heads south to Lower Devils and Hackberry Creek. From there long hiking paths lead to the top of the Leap and rappelling into the climbing. The replacement involves use of USFS FR 2440. This “west side approach” allows for the preferable approach from the bottom of the climbing areas. Northern Devils Canyon – While not within the lands impacted directly by the Land Exchange nor Mining Plan of Operations, Northern Devils access should be secured. Historical access has occurred on the USFS FR 342 road that departs Highway 60 heading north to a power substation shortly east of the intersection of Magma Mine road and Highway 60."

Given that Resolution is offering the RUG trail system as a mitigation, Rio Tinto must either purchase the mineral rights to the area from Bronco Creek and give them to the Town or be required to bond the value of entire trail system and its economic impact on the Town of Superior. Resolution Copper should guarantee continued recreational access to the Legends of Superior Trails Queen Creek Canyon segment (old Highway 60) along its entire length including the tunnel. The

Resolution needs to invest directly in the school system on a continual basis until the number of students supports quality education that will allow local residents to qualify for high-tech and mining jobs of the future. The best example that the schools need direct Resolution Copper support is the mine’s managers refuse to live in Superior citing an inferior school system.

"3.7.03","Water Resources: Water Quantity (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A number of important changes in water flow have occurred both inside and outside Tonto National Forest AFTER the Scoping Comment Period was closed for the Resolution Copper/Oak Flat EIS process. The changes created a new baseline of facts which the general public has had no opportunity to address, and the current DEIS is deficient in not incorporating these facts.
The remedy: Tonto NF should make these facts available to the general public (certainly to people who submitted Scoping Comments at the beginning of the EIS process, as well as to the public at large) so that the Public can participate in the creation of a Supplementary Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Preferably, Tonto NF would conduct studies and surveys to determine how widespread the effects of actions by Resolution Copper and Tonto NF have been on the availability of fresh water within the National Forest and outside Tonto’s boundaries as well. The studies and surveys should look at effects on plant and animal life within Tonto NF AND the current and predictable future effects on people and ecosystems outside Tonto NF which may be suffering deprivation of water already with even more deprivation of clean, potable water if the Resolution GPO is accepted and allowed (the Resolution GPO should NOT be accepted as it is fatally deficient in a number of respects to be mentioned later in this message.)
These studies would provide the basis for the Public to offer informed Scoping Comments on the Supplementary Draft EIS or, because water wasting affects all aspects of life inside the Tonto NF and many aspects of life in the surrounding towns, to offer the public the opportunity to submit Scoping Comments to rework the EIS as a whole, from the beginning, so that short‐term and long‐term problems on all issues already raised may be re‐examined in the light of essential, more complete information.
Certainly, where crucial elements such as water are concerned, the Tonto FS EIS team should devote its energies to the studies and fact‐finding needed to initiate and work through a Supplementary DEIS process, beginning with Scoping, or through a fully revised EIS, beginning with Scoping. The EIS Team should not divide its energies and focus by attempting to continue preparation of a Final EIS based on flawed and incomplete information.
A Supplementary Draft EIS would have to merge with the existing DEIS though the Supplementary DEIS might need to replace entire portions of the existing DEIS. Shoehorning a Supplementary Draft EIS into the existing DEIS as an Appendix, as an afterthought, at the tail‐end of this environmental review would be illogical and unfair, preventing groups and individuals from reacting to a coherent, integrated document about this important question: water and the proposed Mine, its effects on the long‐term health of the Tonto NF, as well as the well‐being of surrounding towns & communities (both small and large), and the health and well‐being of both People and ecosystems across the breadth of Arizona.
My concerns begin with a particular moment and expand to a wider view as more alarming incidents and information have come to light. Initially, friends from the San Carlos Apache Peoples alerted me and many others to an alarming drop in the waters of sacred streams, springs, pools, and the iconic pond near the entrance to Tonto NF, from the road to the NF out of
Superior, AZ, sometime in 2017. [SEE COMMENT LETTER FOR PHOTOS]  These four photos are borrowed from a very skilled photographer who resides in Superior, AZ, and has hiked in and documented Oak Flat, Ga’an Canyon, Apache Leap, and other sites in Tonto NF over many years. 
My alarm increased even more the next year, 2018, when an Apache friend from the San Carlos Reservation told an audience in Los Angeles (while I was in attendance) that the springs and pools were very low or dried out for a second year in a row.
There are other photos of the Native Peoples and friends hiking upward from spot to spot within Tonto NF and within the Greater Oak Flat region, dismayed by the absence of the sacred waters. (I do not include these pictures just mentioned to protect the privacy of the individuals involved in the walk.)
These dried‐out conditions were so diametrically opposed to descriptions of the Oak Flat region which I had submitted Scoping Comments on, Oak Flat and Ga’an Canyon being among the increasingly few desert lands in Arizona with yearround water flowing, a boon to human visitors, a necessity to wildlife. After the first drying out, I contacted and spoke with Mr. John Scaggs, Public Information Officer for Tonto NF. Mr. Scaggs told me that the drying out of the sacred waters within Tonto NF was likely caused by very substantial pumping being conducted by Resolution Copper out of the old Magma Mine which Resolution planned to use as the entry point for mining operations when the EIS process was completed.
When I suggested to Mr. Scaggs that Tonto NF had a trust responsibility to the health of the plants and animals inside Tonto who rely on the abundant water to stay healthy and alive, he replied that Tonto NF had no jurisdiction over waterpumping occurring on lands held privately or by the State of Arizona. I did not pursue the discussion with Mr. Scaggs further but was appalled that a representative of Tonto NF felt no duty to help the life which forest managers are charged with protecting.
The next year, I called again and this time spoke with Ms. Mary Rasmussen. Ms. Rasmussen was no more eager to take
action to halt the drying up of crucial waters than Mr. Scaggs had been. She said the drops in water levels were not the
result of pumping by Resolution but could be attributed to the ordinary oscillations and vagaries of climate and
precipitation from year to year.
In the last day or so (Nov., 2019), I consulted with an Apache friend who has professional responsibilities in San Carlos
Tribal matters. She said that highs and lows could indeed reflect weather cycles to a certain extent but that she had
never seen declines in the sacred waters of this magnitude. Some months ago, I consulted by phone with Mr. Randy Serraglio of the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD). His hunch about the precipitous decline in the sacred pool *might* have been caused by exploratory drilling done by Resolution (with the permission of Tonto NF managers) near the pool. Mr. Serraglio said that the pool held its waters so near the surface due to an “aquitard,” a geologic formation of clay or non‐porous rock with very low hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the pool. Mr. Serraglio speculated that Resolution’s drilling might have punctured the
bottom of the rock or clay, like boring through the bottom of a bath tub, so that the waters of the sacred pool were allowed to drain away into a lower stratum or aquifer.
None of these conversations bolstered my confidence in the U.S. Forest Service or Resolution Copper. Neither the public nor the private entity emerged as thoughtful experts in geology or as caring stewards of the lands and waters or the living beings whose home is in the Tonto NF and who have, over millenia, made this part of Arizona a beautiful refuge and oasis.
If any of these examples of carelessness (or, worse, indifference) to Life were mentioned in the current DEIS, I missed
them.
I think the Public deserves to know about and Comment upon the significant declines allowed in the sacred waters, the
harm risked to the health of the animals and plants of the Greater Oak Flat region. The Public didn’t know to comment I think the Public deserves to know about and Comment upon the significant declines allowed in the sacred waters, the harm risked to the health of the animals and plants of the Greater Oak Flat region. The Public didn’t know to comment because the mistakes and “oh‐well” attitudes of both the USFS and Resolution didn’t occur UNTIL AFTER the Scoping Period had ended. Given new baseline conditions in Tonto NF, the Public must be given a new Scoping period to offer Comments and to raise issues based on these facts which have emerged AFTER Scoping was closed the first time around."

Emerman gives an expert’s viewpoint, with information which neither Resolution Copper nor the Tonto NF has provided. As a result, upcoming studies of important geologic and hydraulic situations should be done by scientists who are not employed by Resolution Copper (their information appears fatally biased by their self-interest), nor should Tonto NF rely solely on its own staff for such studies Tonto NF has missed too much because of Tonto’s willingness to rely on the biased views of Resolution Copper. Independent geologists and hydraulics experts is essential as Tonto NF works to give the Public a far more accurate picture of the damage Resolution has already done to waters of Tonto NF, the State of Arizona, and the living beings and ecosystems dependent on that water.
The conclusions and implications of Dr. Emerman are clear: Rio Tonto and Resolution DO NOT TRULY KNOW whether the mine would be a profitable venture or a safe enterprise for its workers. The information Resolution et al have provided appears to be a boilerplate GPO, unattached to the actual risks and unknowns that await them underground."

Further detailed analysis of land subsidence resulting from groundwater withdrawal is not feasible beyond noting the potential for any pumping to contribute to drawdown and subsidence. Subsidence effects are a basin-wide phenomenon, and the impact from one individual pumping source cannot be predicted or quantified. This is a significant impact that is inevitably going to occur, but for which there is no remediation effort described. On its face, this seems to be a significant negative impact that has far reaching consequences, to a large number of people and businesses; along with agriculture and industry interests, for a significant period of time. Yet there is no mitigation requirement identified in the Draft EIS, despite the fact that this could have significant financial impact. Financial resources need to be set aside by RCM to address this issue. Further this issue needs additional study and research because although it is difficult to quantify exactly how much of an impact this will have, nonetheless, it will have a significant impact. Who is going to pay for that impact? If RCM causes the damage RCM should pay for the cost to mitigate the impact.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The Draft EIS explains that, as modelled, groundwater and surface water quality impact predictions are based on assumptions that ""fractured rock in the collapsed block-cave zone does not contact oxygen and chemical weathering does not supply any chemical load to the sump water"" (Draft EIS page 350), and that actual water quality constituent concentrations in the sump could be substantially higher than predicted and summarized in the Draft EIS. To illustrate the potential magnitude of difference in water quality, Table 3.7.2-1 in the Draft EIS shows predictions of block-cave sump water quality for assumptions of less oxidation (Eary 20188[FOOTNOTE: 8 Eary 2018. Block Cave Geochemical Model - 2018 Update on Calculation Approach and Results. Technical memorandum. Loveland, Colorado: Enchemica, LLC.

Scottsdale, Arizona: Hatch. January 8]) . The Hatch-predicted concentrations are more than double Eary-predicted concentrations for magnesium, potassium, sulfate, antimony, and thallium; and orders of magnitude greater for aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury,10 [FOOTNOTE: 10 Table 3.7.2.-1 does not report a value for mercury concentrations under Eary conditions, but it is unclear if this was not modelled or omitted for some other reason.

While EPA acknowledges that this same magnitude of difference would not be seen in final surface water and groundwater concentrations affected by tailings seepage, if actual conditions result in more oxidation in the block-cave zone and in stockpiled ore than is currently assumed for the Draft EIS, water quality standard exceedances for all action alternatives could be more numerous and significant than currently estimated. As discussed in Hatch, for the parameters evaluated (i.e. pH, sulfate, copper, and selenium) concentrations of selenium and sulfate are sensitive to oxidation and likely cannot be mitigated by lime amendments, further underscoring the need for an accurate and reasonably conservative assessment of impacts to water quality. Eary's (2018) assumptions for oxidation appear to be based on an idealized mining process schedule that could be delayed for periods over the life of the mine, resulting in greaterthan- modelled oxidation. Surface water and groundwater quality impacts are likely underestimated and should be updated with a more conservative assumption about the extent of oxidation of fractured rock in the block-cave zone and in ore stockpiles at the surface. Recommendation: Clarify the degree of uncertainty in assumptions about oxidation in the blockcave zone and surface ore stockpiles, including a discussion of the most reasonably conservative oxidation conditions likely to occur. Revise water quality predictions for surface water and groundwater using the more reasonably conservative oxidation assumptions for fractured blockcave rock based on Hatch (2016) or another, more realistic period of oxidation.

EPA has yet to receive a redesignation request from ADEQ. Even if such a request had been approved, the EPA would redesignate the area to maintenance/attainment, and general conformity remains applicable for maintenance areas [40 CFR 153(b)(2)]. Because construction emissions associated with the East Plant Site and TSF exceed the General Conformity de minimis threshold of 100 tons/year for PM10, a conformity determination is necessary. 17 [FOOTENOTE: 17 Table 3-12, Resolution Copper Project NEPA Air Quality Impacts Analyses, Air Sciences Inc., February 2019.]  The Draft EIS notes that some facilities would be located in the West Pinal PM10 Nonattainment Area, and that those emissions are below the de minimis threshold. It does not mention that emissions associated with the East Plant Site are within the Miami PM10 Nonattainment Area, and that the emissions exceed the de minimis threshold.18 [FOOTNOTE: 18 Ibid.] For directly emitted pollutants such as PM10, agencies may demonstrate conformity through a dispersion analysis that demonstrates the project will not cause or contribute to any new violation of any air quality standard or increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation [40 CFR 93.158(b)]. While the Draft EIS relied on just such an analysis contained in the Resolution Copper Project NEPA Air Quality Impacts Analyses, we are concerned that it may have underestimated PM10, as well as PM2.s emissions. The dispersion analysis used the Arizona Statewide average for silt content of 3.0% in calculations for fugitive emissions from unpaved road and other sources. For unpaved roads, EPA's AP-42, Chapter 13.2.2, outlines that site-specific silt content information should be used when available, but, when they cannot be obtained, the sector-specific averages available in Table 13.2.2-1 should be used. In the absence of site-specific silt content for unpaved road emissions from the project, we recommend the sector-specific averages as the closest analogue and average silt content to use. In either case, it does not appear that modelled air quality concentrations would exceed the PM10 or PM2.s NAAQS; however, this should be verified by the USFS. We acknowledge the revised dispersion analysis is unlikely to show the preferred alternative will cause or contribute to an increase in the severity or frequency of NAAQS violations; however, 40 CFR 93.159(b) states, ""the analyses required under this subpart must be based on the latest and most accurate emission estimation techniques available ...

With a different underground mining technique that uses tailing backfilling, Oak Flat will be saved, far less water will be consumed, and the size of the tailings impoundment necessary will be a fraction of the size.

This information is needed to accurately analyze potential environmental impacts to water quality for the purposes of NEPA. The EPA understands that this baseline data is being gathered and would be used to inform reclamation and closure plans as well as to refine impact modelling for the Final EIS. 
This substitution, along with missing data on potential preferential flow paths for Skunk Camp, could mean that actual impacts to groundwater and surface water quality could be substantially different than currently predicted and could result in exceedances of water quality standards. Given the differences between alternatives in topography and proximity to downstream perennial waters, the USFS concludes that potential impacts to water quality from the Skunk Camp alternative could be more easily controlled; however, this simple ranking of the available alternatives cannot substitute for a full analysis and disclosure of the potential impacts from the ""preferred alternative"" as these impacts could still be unacceptable and, based on an accurate analysis of impacts, design changes to mitigate impacts may need to be developed, including changes that could require more direct fill of jurisdictional waters than currently estimated.

"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Resolution Copper's proposed monitoring and mitigation plan for impacts to seeps and springs and other groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs), titled ""Monitoring and Mitigation Plan for Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems and Water Wells,""7 [FOOTNOTE: 7 Montgomery and Associates Inc.2019. Monitori11g a11d Mitigation Plan for Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems and Water Wells. Tucson, Arizona: Montgomery and Associates lnc. April 12. - Available at https:/ /www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/fi les/references/montgomery-monitori ng-mitigation-plan-201 9. pdf] is referenced in the Draft EIS's Appendix J (Draft EIS page J-8). In Section 3 of the Plan, on monitoring, the document briefly describes the intention to deconvolute regional environmental variables such as climate, ""other human causes,"" fires, etc. from impacts due to mining-related groundwater drawdown. EPA acknowledges that there are numerous environmental variables in addition to mining that might decrease discharge at GDEs. It is important to note that these impacts are, by nature, cumulative. For example, impacts to a spring due, in part, to a period of drought cannot be easily separated from the incremental impact on the spring system due to groundwater drawdown. Deconvoluting the mining signal from the different stresses would need to be a highly nuanced analysis requiring much higher resolution monitoring data than currently exists. The proposed methodology would not be effective in identifying and mitigating only the incremental impact due to mining-related groundwater drawdown. In Section 3.3 on ""Mitigation Triggers,"" the plan states that mitigation thresholds would only be triggered based on multiple lines of evidence that impacts to GDEs are ""caused by mine activities."" (page 7). All the GD Es covered by the Plan have been selected because multiple lines of evidence already indicate that there is a high likelihood that dewatering will impact them (connection to bedrock source, within the 10-foot drawdown contour, etc.). Barring a sophisticated signal deconvolution methodology, impacts to these GDEs should be assumed to be from mining activities. EPA is concerned that without specific upfront mitigation triggers, needed mitigation may not be initiated. Furthermore, the value of ""Level 1"" triggers is unclear because they appear to simply require additional monitoring and comparison with reference sites that could also be impacted since they are within the modelled 10- foot drawdown contour. Recommendations: Develop quantitative trigger thresholds for mitigation actions for each GOE based on available baseline monitoring data for flow, water stage (height), and/or vegetation, as appropriate to each individual GDE. Include specific mitigation goals in reference to baseline monitored conditions and criteria by which mitigation success would be evaluated. As explained in Appendix J, ""the plan specifically notes that it is not intended to address water sources associated with perched shallow groundwater in alluvium or fractures."" Conceptually, EPA agrees that it is appropriate to exclude perched shallow groundwater in alluvium; however, we do not agree that GDEs connected to fractures and supported by fracture flow should be excluded from monitoring and mitigation. Fracture flow, especially in the Apache Leap tuff and Whitetail conglomerate, may be the dominant discharge mechanism and some fracture systems may be connected over large geographic areas. Recommendation: Provide additional detail about the proposed monitoring and mitigation
required for the project for regularly flowing GDEs emanating from fractures."

The continued existence of perennial flow in these stream reaches is based on critical (e.g., low flow) conditions, not median or peak flow conditions. While the EIS analysis cannot substitute for State permitting or water quality certifications which may also use low flow conditions, an evaluation of surface water quality impacts under low flow conditions is necessary in the EIS to capture the full range of significant impacts that could result from the project.

Permanent upstream diversion at Alternatives 2 and 4 would be designed for the probable maximum flood while downstream seepage collection dams would be designed to the 200-year, 24-hour event. For Alternative 6, it appears that all diversion structures would be designed to contain the peak flow of the 24-hour, 100-year event, but the basis of design for downstream facilities is not clear. Recommendations: For all alte1'natives, clarify the design bases for upstream and downstream facilities needed to divert or manage stormwater and avoid discharge of tailings contact water to the environment. Provide a comparative analysis of implications for tailings seepage management between alternatives, as compared with the most conservative design requirement for upstream diversion. For downstream seepage collection dams, provide a comparison of the possible quantity and water quality of releases between alternatives, as compared with the most conservative flood event used across alternatives.

"NP08","NEPA: Financial Assurance for Closure/Post-Closure","NP","NEPA Process","The Draft EIS explains that, for reclamation, ""Resolution Copper would be required to establish and maintain sufficient financial assurance in accordance with requirements from the USPS, ASLD, BLM, the APP program, and the Arizona Mined Land Reclamation Act. The purpose of financial assurance is to ensure that responsible agencies would be able to continue any remaining reclamation activities if Resolution Copper becomes unable to meet reclamation and closure and post-closure obligations under the terms and conditions of the applicable permits and approvals"" (page 65). Elsewhere, it is explained that the USACE ""requires financial assurance under Section 404 of the CW A where applicable"" (page 104) and that, for closure and post-closure activities, ""Alternative 6 differs from the other alternatives because the tailings facility would not be located on lands managed by the USPS (as in Alternatives 2, 3, and 4) or BLM (Alternative 5). For Alternative 6, the Federal financial assurance mechanisms would not be applicable"" (page 205). Given that Alternative 6 could require up to 40 years of active closure and post-closure management, it is not clear whether or how these activities might be funded or if sufficient funds would be assured by the appropriate financial assurance mechanism: EPA is, therefore, unable to determine the extent to which the project may represent a long-term financial liability. We recommend a more specific discussion of the estimated financial assurance amount and mechanisms be provided, given that long-term water management could be required. This would provide a basis for evaluating whether the reclamation and closure activities would be effective in the event of a bankruptcy or compliance issues. · Recommendations: Clarify the reclamation, closure, post-closure management and other mitigation requirements that could be covered for the USFS preferred alternative and confirm the USACE's authority for requiring financial assurances. Summarize all anticipated post-closure activities and their associated costs and include, in a draft form, a financial assurance cost estimate. Address how financial assurance requirements would be obtained based on future monitoring through State programs if the project proponent were no longer financially viable following the unplanned cessation or planned conclusion of operations.

"3.7.03","Water Resources: Water Quantity (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","While this current closure plan has the potential to achieve passive management that could better avoid ponding on the surface of the closed facility, the additional flows that would be diverted to Mineral Creek may poses challenges for operations at the USACE's Big Box Dam and for water management at Ray Mine, through which Mineral Creek runs. Table 3.7.3-4 of the Draft EIS shows that flows in Devil's Creek at the confluence with Mineral Creek are expected to decrease by an annual average of 3.5% due to upstream changes to the watershed from underground mining and subsidence common to all alternatives, but it is unclear what the net flow changes in Mineral Creek above Ray Mine would be after closure of the tailings of Alternative 6. Recommendation: For Alternative 6, include estimates for total changes in streamflow in Mineral Creek at Big Box dam in operation, closure, and post-closure phases. If net increases in flow would occur in any phase, analyze and disclose the potential effects to Big Box Dam, whether the dam can manage these additional flows, or whether changes to Big Box Dam would be necessary. If additional flows could not be managed by Big Box dam, consider alternative closure plans for Alternative 6. "
"ALT03","Proposed New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives","The EPA encourages a detailed evaluation of a filtered, ""dry stack"" technology option for tailings at the ""Alternative 6 - Skunk Camp"" location because a filtered tailings management method could be practicable, could reduce direct fill impacts to waters of the U.S., and could be less environmentally damaging. Direct impacts to groundwater could be reduced by minimizing the need for supplemental process water and the risk of catastrophic failure could be lower as compared with a slurry type facility at the same location. Adverse effects to water quality modelled at ""Alternative 4 - Silver King"" may be manageable to within applicable standards at Skunk Camp but detailed analysis is needed.

While Alternative 6 would likely be the most resilient slurry type facility considered, a properly designed and managed filtered tailings facility at any alternative site would have the lowest probability of catastrophic failure compared with any slurry facility. Recommendation: Clarify conclusions about tailings safety by comparing all tailings management and designs across alternatives. A filtered facility is fundamentally more stable than a slurry facility, has the lowest probability of catastrophic failure and likely poses the least risk. "

If selected, the preferred alternative and pipeline option could impact up to 5,597 acres of potential habitat for the cactus, including 98 individual Arizona hedgehog cacti identified in surveys, as well as critical habitat for the endangered Gila chub (Gila intermedia) along Mineral Creek. Indirect effects to critical and proposed-critical habitat for the endangered Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) and threatened Western yellow-billed cuckoo (Distinct Population Segment) (Coccyzus americanus) could result from impacts to water quality from tailings seepage. Other alternatives could affect these species or habitat, as well as critical habitat for endangered Acuna cactus (Echinomastus erectocentrus var. acunensis) at Alternative 5; however, based on the information in the Draft EIS, adverse effects to federally-listed species from the preferred alternative appear to be greater overall than from other available alternatives. Specific application of mitigation measures to avoid or minimize impacts the federally-listed species do not appear to be discussed in the Draft EIS. Conceptual plans and best management practices that could compensate for or offset impacts are mentioned, but no analysis for how unavoidable impacts could be mitigated is presented. Although the Draft EIS identifies ""Alternative 6 - Skunk Camp"" as the USFS ""preferred alternative"" and states that ""The Tonto National Forest will begin consultation with the FWS regarding species protected under Section 7 of the ESA once a preferred alternative is identified,"" (Draft EIS page 713) the Draft EIS does not appear to include any additional details on consultation. Recommendations: Provide information about formal consultation between USFWS, USFS, and the USACE and identify what additional avoidance, minimization or mitigation measures will be employed to further reduce impacts to the sensitive, threatened or endangered species that may be affected by the ""preferred alternative"" or other alternatives.

Using this method gives Resolution Copper more profits, but destroys natural resources and puts people and more natural resources at risk. Mining in the National Forest should not happen at all, but, if this project goes forward, Resolution Copper should be required to use the cut and fill method, which would require the tailings to be put back into the horizontal core they were taken out of.

The land contains more than 2,400 acres of the Oak Flat Campground, an area dotted with petroglyphs and historic and prehistoric sites. • Consideration of all threatened & endangered species: The Hedgehog cactus. The Ga'an Canyon has a variety of bird & aquatic life. • A rare desert riparian area and oasis of biodiversity. Less than 10 percent of this habitat type remains in Arizona to support the native plants and animals that can’t survive without it. • Industrial mining will severely deplete precious groundwater resources. ** The fact that groundwater is limited & a much needed resource to sustain life, should not be subject to profiteering resource extraction schemes, that will forever damage the landscape, and something as important as safe drinking water. • National Forest lands are supposed to be mixed use. A prized recreation area within the Tonto National Forest... For hiking, biking, camping, birdwatching, canyoneering and especially bouldering and rock climbing — with more than 2,500 established climbing routes. Why would a private corporation be allowed to not only use the land for private profit, but destroy it's use after they are done. • The religious freedom of Native American tribes... For generations too numerous to count, Native Americans have congregated in the shade of the oak trees for ceremonies, gathering of foods and medicines, and burials. This area is likely to collapse into the mine crater. • “The taking of one people’s human right threatens all human and religious rights,” said San Carlos Apache Chairman Terry Rambler. “We must stand together and fight those, like Resolution Copper, that seek to take our religious freedom, our most human right.” For far too long, Treaties & promises have been broken & sacred ground desecrated. There is no endless inventory of Sacred ground, and unique areas. There has been enough pillaging of the land, and the disastrous aftermath. The mine would use a special new technique to excavate the ore body 7,000 feet underground. The material removed from this mine would cover thousands of acres of public land with toxic mine waste, and when the mine is closed it would leave behind a crater up to two miles wide and 1,000 feet deep.

The tailings storage facility is primarily a change in the landform, though the associated structures may also be visible from some locations. The visual contrast would be caused by the vegetation clearing, and the new landform being created (its rectilinear contours, flat top field, straight lines, smooth surfaces. The Visual Contrast rating is missing the ratings for the landform and vegetation features to support the conclusion.

Notes on Seepage Transport Modeling (Reference: 28_Gergory_Bayley_2018_MA_110589.pdf) – PegLeg Alternative 5
- How is the single K value computed? (2.11 ft/day) This number is outside of the typical range for stream alluvium and on the extreme low end for upper and lower basin fill (Anderson et al 1992). There’s also a wide range for K values in the alluvium presented in Fleming et al 2018 that are taken from the Near West site and could be used.
- 25% diffuse recharge split? –Diffuse recharge from Meixner et al (2016) was approximated as zero for the San Pedro Watershed – Other arid systems likely have similar amounts of diffuse recharge (ie none to very little). So characterizing diffuse recharge as 25% and underflow is not correct.
- TSF location is directly on top of where the bedrock meets the alluvium where mountain front recharge is likely to occur. Locating the TSF here is likely to reduce the total system recharge.
- M&A model uses 2 samples in the Donnelly Wash Sub-basin but EIS only mentions one.
- Exploration wells should be used to confirm depths to bedrock and density in HGI survey
- Conglomerate composes Northern parts of many of the different mixing cells – not sure why this is included and why parts of Donnelly Wash are excluded in the model boundaries. HGI surveys do not extend into the 5th subdomain but do show a potential thinning of the alluvium in that section (which is opposite of the model subdomain). Should explain why the 5th subdomain is expanded into the conglomerate.
- Currently the model is deterministic (ie giving you one outcome), given the uncertainties - a probabilistic model of the system would be better suited to inform decision makers of the likelihood or unlikelihood of contamination of the Gila River. GoldSim is equipped to do this."

There are, in fact, several areas within the GSR Property where the Pipeline can be located that will minimize, if not avoid, harm to sensitive Mineral Creek riparian lands and cultural resources, as well as avoid the need to disrupt more of Tonto National Forest lands by a route that must cross more of such NFS lands to completely avoid the GSR Property. I have and will continue to work with Resolution Copper to identify routing alternatives across the GSR Property and reasonable mitigation in connection therewith The significantly smaller GSR Property may be subject to some of the adverse impacts noted above with respect to the Grazing Lease and Grazing Permit, but to the extent they exist at all, they are believed to be much less and more easily mitigated. In summary, GSR is supportive of a modified Alternative 6, and believes it can be revised in a way that, with negotiated mitigation of adverse impact to GSR, will be appropriately supportive of the purpose and needs of the Project.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","It is essential that the Forest Service recognize that this EIS process is unique due to the legislation imposed by Congress on the normal EIS process. Specifically, Section 3003 of the FY 2015 NDAA states: 
“Not later than 60 days after the date of publication of the final environmental impact statement, the Secretary shall convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Federal land to Resolution Copper.” 
When Congress imposed this language on the RCM EIS, it did not reduce or eliminate the agencies’ duties to fully comply with NEPA, the CWA, Forest Service Organic Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and all other federal laws. The language above merely directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey the approximately 2,422 acres of public land at Oak Flat to RCM after the Final EIS is published—and requires said transfer of ownership no later than 60 days after final EIS publication. 
The NDAA did not require the agencies to approve the mine GPO, 404 permit, or any other request by the company. Although it could be argued that the NDAA eliminated the USFS Objection process for the Exchange, which we do not concede, it did not remove those procedural and substantive safeguards for public review and challenge for the GPO or any other agency action. That means that any Final EIS/Draft ROD objection period, resolution of objections, and Final Record of Decision on the RCM GPO must occur, although possibly after RCM has already taken title to the public land at Oak Flat. Since transfer of title to this currently public land will cause irreparable harm to the public, including Native Americans, recreational users of Oak Flat, and surrounding communities, and to the environment, this is highly problematic and demonstrates exactly why the Forest Service must treat this DEIS somewhat differently than a normal DEIS. 
Because there will very likely be no meaningful opportunity to comment after the FEIS is published, the DEIS for this proposed project must be complete and inclusive of all aspects of the mine project. The DEIS must include any and all impacts on which the public should have an opportunity to comment. Unfortunately, the current version of the DEIS is severely lacking. There are numerous significant areas of analyses that were identified during the project scoping period that have not been addressed in the current DEIS. 
"
"NP03","NEPA: Purpose and Need","NP","NEPA Process"," by narrowing its purpose and need statement, USFS considered an unreasonably narrow range of alternatives. […]
 Section 1.3 (DEIS, page 6) says that the purpose and need for this project is “To consider approval of a proposed mine plan governing surface disturbance on NFS lands outside of the exchange parcels from mining operations that are reasonably incident to extraction, transportation, and processing of copper and molybdenum” and to “consider the effects of the exchange of lands between Resolution Copper and the United States as directed by Section 3003 of the NDAA.” 
Yet the Proposed Action Section 1.4 (DEIS, page 8) says that the proposed action consists of “approval of a mining plan of operations on NFS land associated with a proposed large-scale mine….” 
This articulation fails to describe the purpose and need of the actual proposed project here in southern Arizona. First, as discussed in detail below, the DEIS needs to be revised or supplemented to determine whether Resolution Copper’s mining claims on federal lands outside of the properties to be exchanged under the NDAA are valid under existing law, as well as a detailed analysis of the factual basis for any rights asserted by the company to determine the proper scope of the USFS’s authority. 
The DEIS asserts that the Forest Service’s goal is to “foster and encourage private enterprise in the development of economically sound and stable domestic mining, minerals, and metal and mineral reclamation...” (DEIS at 8). Yet, on the other hand, this particular proposed mine would be inconsistent with numerous, important aspects of the forest plan, the purpose and need statement fails to make any judgment on the dichotomy between these two statements (DEIS at 10). 
The agency’s focus on the general need to support mineral development under the 1970 Mining and Mineral Policy Act (DEIS at 8) is misplaced. First, that Act, which merely notes general principles, creates no controlling statutory mandate on the agency. Instead, the USFS’s primary mandate is to protect the forest from destruction and depredations under the 1897 Organic Act. The agency’s guiding congressional mandate regarding the national forests is “to regulate their occupancy and use and to preserve the forests thereon from destruction.” 16 U.S.C. §551. 
Instead of following its mandate, the USFS proposes to amend the Forest Plan without credible analysis as to whether the purpose and need of the project warrants such a significant amendment to the forest plan. To credibly evaluate the purpose and need for this project and associated features of it, the entire section needs to be rewritten following determination of the legal status of Resolution Copper’s claims and other asserted rights.  [see Letter submittal pg. 18 for additional detail].
"
"NP03","NEPA: Purpose and Need","NP","NEPA Process","the DEIS incorrectly omits other federal requirements, such as the issuance of a Right-of-Way (ROW) under FLPMA. The agencies propose to expand existing ROWs (e.g. MARRCO Corridor) apparently under the guise of the existing railroad ROW, yet the agencies would approve substantially different and expanded uses of the existing ROW, which requires a new FLPMA review. For the new ROWs (such as to the Skunk Camp tailings facility), an entirely new ROW review under FLPMA is required."
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","The USFS is under the mistaken belief that its review and approval of Resolution’s proposed uses of federal land, and all of the proposed activities, are solely under the GPO and the agency’s hardrock mining regulations at 36 CFR Part 228. See DEIS at 13. According to the agency, this is because there are some unpatented mining claims on some of the lands to be covered by project facilities. See DEIS at 148. The DEIS also states that the existing Forest Plan must be amended to accommodate the GPO. DEIS at 10-11. 
In Section ES-2.1 the DEIS says: “however, the responsible official -- the Forest Supervisor, Tonto National Forest -- does not have discretion to select the no action alternative, because it would not be consistent with the requirements of 36 CFR 228.5…” In 1.5.1.1 General Plan of Operations the DEIS says: “Regulations that govern the use of surface resources in conjunction with mining operations on NFS lands are set forth under 36 CFR 228 Suppart A.” 
According to the USFS, Resolution has “a right to conduct mining activities.” DEIS at 135. In “Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies, and Plans” the DEIS says: “Administration of locatable mineral resources on NFS lands follow direction in federal regulations (36 CFR 228 Subpart A).” DEIS at 135. Yet, for the federal lands remaining after the exchange, there are no “locatable mineral resources on NFS lands” to be regulated, as according to the USFS and Resolution Copper, all the valuable locatable minerals are in the ore body to be exchanged away to the company. 
The mere fact that the company submitted a GPO does not mean that all, indeed any, aspects of the project that remain in federal ownership are regulated only under Part 228 or that approving the GPO is the USFS’s only choice. Indeed, because the record lacks any evidence that the company has statutory rights under federal mining laws, including the 1872 Mining Law, to any of the lands to remain in federal ownership, review and regulation of the project is not under Part 228, but rather the agency’s special use and multiple use authorities (36 CFR Part 251/261), including ROWs under FLPMA. 
The USFS’ overly-restricted interpretation of its authority was squarely and recently rejected by the federal court in Arizona. On July 31, 2019, the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona issued its decision in Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , --F.Supp.3d--, 2019 WL 3503330 (D. Ariz. 2019), in which the court vacated and remanded the USFS’s approval of a large copper mine (the Rosemont Mine) due to the agency’s erroneous interpretation and application of the 1872 Mining Law, federal public land law, and NEPA. 
The Arizona federal court squarely rejected the same federal government position taken in the DEIS – that mining claimants are entitled to use and occupy mining claims absent any evidence that the claims are valid under the Mining Law, or that the Part 228 regulations are the proper regulatory vehicle for operations proposed off of valid claims – and ruled that the government’s statutory interpretation was contrary to the plain language and controlling case law under the Mining Law, Organic Act, NEPA, and other laws. The Rosemont decision rejected the government’s position that it has no authority to apply its broader public land regulations to mining operations proposed on lands that fail to meet the Mining Law’s statutory prerequisites for rights against the United States. [See letter submittal pgs. 22-29 for additional detail]"
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," The DEIS Fails to Comply with the Requirements for Rights of Ways under FLPMA Title V.  

Like with the other facilities proposed on the remaining federal lands, the USFS is under the mistaken belief that the pipeline and other corridors and uses thereof are subject only to the Part 228 regulations. As noted above, that is wrong. For the corridors, the DEIS fails to meet the strict public interest, environmental protection, and financial requirements of FLPMA.  

The legal flaw in the USFS’ refusal to require a FLPMA ROW is shown in the DEIS’ Table of “permits, licenses, and authorizations required for the Resolution Copper Project,” DEIS at 19 (Table 1.5.4-1). There, in addition to failing to recognize the need for a FLPMA ROW, the agency notes that for the Peg Leg tailings corridor in Alternative 5, a FLPMA ROW would be required to cross/occupy BLM lands: “To use BLM-managed public lands for right-of-way purposes, Resolution Copper would need to obtain surface use authorization from BLM for any right-of-way that crosses BLM-managed public lands.” DEIS at 19.  

Yet, the USFS ignores the fact that the FLPMA ROW requirement applies equally to USFS lands as well as BLM lands. Thus, as the agency admits, if FLPMA requires Resolution Copper to obtain a ROW for crossing BLM lands for the tailings corridor, then FLPMA necessarily requires a similar ROW to cross USFS lands. In other words, the USFS cannot use the GPO to approve the corridors to cross USFS lands, when it admits that a FLPMA ROW would be required to cross BLM lands.

"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Underground mining alternatives to block caving were eliminated from further consideration in the DEIS. These methods were eliminated from detailed consideration in the DEIS based largely on two factors, the cost of mining and the feasibility of large-scale tailings backfill. The DEIS identifies the environmental and social values that would be lost due to block caving, but does not give these factors the same weight as cost of mining and technical feasibility. As will be discussed, the preservation of environmental values (recreation, surface and groundwater loss) and social values (Native American heritage) should be given significant weight in the DEIS if it is reasonably possible to preserve these values.  
The mine will provide some economic value to the region for 41 years, but the impacts due to subsidence will remain in perpetuity. A backfill-compatible underground mining method would allow preservation of environmental and social values predicted to be lost due to subsidence, would not sterilize part of the remaining mineral resource, would mine the ore body more efficiently, and would provide more jobs over a longer term to the local economy.  
The USFS is obligated to evaluate the protection of existing uses and resources, including environmental and social values, as a part of its approval of a GPO. The USFS is already 4 proposing significant changes to the company’s proposed plan of operation, including relocation of the tailings facilities, and construction of centerline/downstream dams instead of upstream dams as proposed by the Resolution Copper. A similar shift to an underground mining technique that would prevent surface subsidence would be similarly sound, for reasons that will be discussed.  
The consideration of alternative mining methods that would allow mining to coexist with ongoing recreational use of Oak Flat (as it has for many decades) is inadequate and must be redone. Methods apart from block or panel caving were rejected on the faulty reasoning that other methods would allow RCM to only extract a smaller percentage of the ore body. Any land exchange involving Oak Flat that effectively vacates PLO 1229 will, by definition, convey 100% of the copper deposit to RCM. As the USFS has said many times, it is not the job of the Forest Service to determine how much profit a mine is allowed to make or can make. That is Resolution Copper’s problem. The Forest Service should therefore perform a detailed mining study that evaluates other mining methods to block caving that would cause no surface subsidence and minimal surface disturbance—so that any future mining at Oak Flat would be compatible with continued recreational and cultural uses of Oak Flat. It is significant that the proposed Twin Metals mine project in Minnesota is envisioning exactly this scenario—backfilling mineworks with tailings to reduce the amount of above ground tailings storage.

"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives"," In our scoping comments, we raised a number of alternatives that were not addressed at all. The DEIS should have either included these alternatives or offered an explanation as to why they were rejected. Since they were not addressed we repeat them here as items missing from this DEIS. 

In particular, the DEIS should have examined the reopening of the San Manuel mine which was opened by BHP, the minority owner of Resolution Copper. That mine was closed around 2004 at the same time the Resolution Copper proposal was gaining legs. The San Manuel mine was closed with at least a 30-year supply of copper and expensive mining equipment was left underground. Mining out this deposit would be preferable and more environmentally benign than building a new mine in an area with such high value for non-mining activity. The DEIS should have done a viability analysis of whether the mine could be reopened both technically and financially. 
"
"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Mining Cost and Production Capacity   
SWCA has used Dundee Capital Markets, 2012, An Introduction to Underground Mining to  bracket underground mining cost estimates (DEIS 2019). SWCA also estimated that all of the  underground mining methods evaluated, except block caving, could accommodate backfilling  which could prevent subsidence. All the underground mining method costs, with the exception of  cut-and-fill mining, were the same cost to approximately twice the cost of block caving (SWCA  2017). This cost range is not unreasonable to evaluate further as viable alternatives, given the  uses and resources that could be saved by eliminating subsidence. Production volume for dry  tailings for underground backfill was also a consideration, and was used as a discriminating  factor for mining method evaluation in the DEIS alternatives screening. It was noted that “ The  process of using dry stack tailings methods has not been done at the scale of the proposed GPO  production scale (130,000 tons per day). The industry maximum of successful dry stack  production is 20,000 tons per day .” (DEIS 2019).   
However, it should also be noted that the USFS recently approved dry stack tailings at the  Rosemont Mine at a production rate of 75,000 tons per day. Since only approximately half of the  tailings are typically backfilled in an underground mine, the dry tailings production rate  approved at Rosemont would be virtually identical to the rate needed for backfill at the RCM.   
Dry tailings/backfill production rate should not be a barrier to underground mining at RCM.

This is not acceptable. The public, tribes, and consulting parties need and  deserve what NEPA and other laws and policies require in and from the DEIS: a full and  detailed, if still not finalized, mitigation plan, including detailed analysis of the effectiveness of  all mitigation measures (which the DEIS does not contain). That plan must be rigorously  attentive to the avoidance and reduction of all foreseeable impacts and harms.  "

In particular, the USFS failure to  complete the soils and vegetation surveys and analyses for the preferred TSF (Alternative 6) has  disabled and hampered public participation and corrupted the alternative selection process.    
Neither the DEIS nor the supporting documents provide an adequate basis for discriminating  among the TSF alternatives. Because the information is incomplete and the analysis remains in  progress, the DEIS fails the essential test of providing a reasoned and evidence-based rationale  for the selection of Skunk Camp as the preferred TSF alternative . The DEIS release in advance  of opportunities for public and tribal involvement in the comparative analysis of TSF alternatives  eliminated and foreclosed upon public participation in the hurried and incompletely disclosed  identification of Alternative 6 as the preferred TSF alternative.

"APPJ","Appendix J- Mitigation and Monitoring Plan","APP","Appendices"," The identification of possible mitigation measures is an integral and important part of NEPA analysis. NEPA requires the identification of possible mitigation measures for adverse environmental impacts. As the Supreme Court has said: 

“Implicit in NEPA’s demand that an agency prepare a detailed statement on ‘any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,’ 42 U.S.C. §4332(C)(ii), is an understanding that the EIS will discuss the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided. [cite omitted] More generally, omission of a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures would undermine the ‘action forcing’ function of NEPA. Without such a discussion, neither the agency nor other interested groups and individuals can properly evaluate the severity of the adverse effects. An adverse effect that can be fully remediated by, for example, an inconsequential public expenditure is certainly not as serious as a similar effect that can only be modestly ameliorated through the commitment of vast public and private resources. Recognizing the importance of such a discussion in guaranteeing that the agency has taken a ‘hard look’ at the environmental consequences of proposed federal action, CEQ regulations require that the agency discuss possible mitigation measures in defining the scope of the EIS, 40 CFR § 1508.25(b) (1987), in discussing alternatives to the proposed action § 1502.14(f), and consequences of that action, § 1502.16(h), and in explaining its ultimate decision, § 1505.2(c).”

 Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 352 (1989).
 The DEIS’s identification/discussion of mitigation measures for the many severe adverse impacts identified in the document is woefully inadequate. For a number of serious impacts, there are simply no mitigation measures identified in the DEIS. In some cases, there are mitigation measures identified in referenced technical reports that are not even mentioned in the body of the DEIS. In other sections, such as transportation, mitigation is proposed that is severely inadequate to address serious safety concerns. The enforceability of mitigation measures for a number of types of impacts is never addressed. 
Similarly, there is little to no discussion of monitoring for most affected resources in the DEIS. Thus, the public has no way of commenting on whether and how the USFS, other involved public agencies, and the affected communities could determine whether any mitigation measures chosen for implementation are actually implemented and what their effectiveness might be over the lifetime of the proposed mine and following its shutdown.

A Mitigation and monitoring plan appears in Appendix J, pages J-1 - J-38. The first paragraph of this section points out clearly that the full suite of mitigation measures intended to avoid or reduce environmental effects is not known and won’t be known until many or most of the permits have been issued. This huge disclaimer makes this section hard to take seriously. As we’ve pointed out throughout these comments, the public must have an opportunity to comment on a final plan before a decision is made. And as with many parts of the DEIS, we are aiming at a moving target. In general, mitigation and monitoring measures suggested in the DEIS are woefully inadequate to avoid or meaningfully reduce the severe environmental effects of the proposed project. Many of the measures would be implemented by Resolution Copper. It is not at all clear that Resolution Copper would have the means or the incentive to implement the meager mitigation and monitoring measures outlined in the DEIS. Further, it is not clear exactly which measure would be required, and if required, what oversight USFS would have over the implementation of those measures. "

Federal, state or municipal/county government contributions depend on budgets and appropriations, and in a period of reduced government funding, the government contributions become vulnerable to reduction or elimination.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","under the agency’s view, the No-Action Alternative cannot be selected because Congress mandated the approval of the land exchange. But that erroneously links the review/approval/denial of the proposed uses on the remaining federal lands with the congressionally-mandated approval of the exchange. Nothing in the NDAA, or any other federal law, requires the USFS (or any other agency such as the Corps) to approve anything beyond the land exchange.  
The DEIS may be correct that denial of the proposed uses would mean that “ the mineral deposit would not be developed.” Id . But that is not determinative of the scope of the agency’s review of the project on the remaining federal lands and does not mean that the agency cannot select that Alternative, because denying those proposed uses is independent of the required approval of the land exchange.  
A proper No Action Alternative, then, should be focused on the company’s proposed uses of federal land (and its related impacts to private and state lands) as if all of the proposed uses on the remaining (non-exchanged) federal lands are denied by the USFS/Corps. Indeed, as detailed above, when the USFS reviews these proposed uses under the proper regulatory structure, the proposed uses cannot be approved, due to irreparable and devastating impacts resulting from approval of the uses.  
Although the agency and Resolution Copper may argue that the company would not propose the exchange if the agency denied the proposed uses on the remaining federal lands, that presupposes that the USFS will approve all the requested uses. Yet, as detailed herein, nothing in the NDAA or any other law requires the agency to approve these uses. Overall, the agency cannot base its view of the No Action Alternative on an incorrect view of the law, or on any presumption that it must approve the proposed uses.  
A legitimate and proper No Action Alternative must, then, consider the conditions that will exist if the agencies deny the proposed uses. For example, because Resolution Copper would have no need to continue to pump/dewater groundwater if it was denied its proposed uses (even after the exchange was done), because it would not have the support facilities necessary to mine the ore body, the baseline and related conditions that would then exist must be considered as the true No Action Alternative condition.  
For example, the USFS incorrectly believes that the dewatering will continue (DEIS at 66) even if the proposed uses were not approved. See also DEIS at 317 (“Under the no action alternative, which includes continued dewatering pumping of the deep groundwater system….”). That does not make sense. The fact that Resolution Copper would obtain the ore body and surrounding lands via the exchange does not mean that it would continue groundwater pumping when it could not conduct the proposed uses on the remaining federal lands. 
"
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","In Section 2.2.3 the DEIS discusses the No Action Alternative, or Alternative 1. The DEIS says: 

“However, note that certain activities are currently taking place on Resolution Copper private property, such as reclamation of the historic Magma Mine; exploration; monitoring of historic mining facilities such as tailings under existing State programs and permits; maintenance of existing shaft infrastructure, including dewatering; and water treatment and piping of treated water along the MARRCO corridor to farmers for beneficial use. These activities are therefore assumed to occur in the no action alternative.”  

That statement cannot be supported by the past history of Rio Tinto and BHP, the owners of Resolution Copper. History shows that when the mining industry abandons a project, they simply walk away and neglect many of the programs that the DEIS insists will be continued. In fact, when the Magma Mine operations (which were owned by BHP at the time) closed in 1996, BHP simply turned off the dewatering pumps in shaft #9. There is no reason to believe that if Alternative 1 is chosen or for some other reason Resolution Copper is denied permits to mine, or if Resolution Copper, for whatever reason decides not to move forward, that reclamation of the historic Magma Mine; exploration; monitoring of historic mining facilities such as tailings under existing State programs and permits; maintenance of existing shaft infrastructure, including dewatering; and water treatment and piping of treated water along the MARRCO corridor to farmers for beneficial use, would continue. A true “no action” alternative would not consider speculative ongoing activities by a company whose owners have a pattern of doing exactly the opposite.  
As Alternative 1 is used to set the baseline conditions from which the DEIS examines all other alternatives, because Alternative 1 makes unreasonable assumptions about activities not likely to take place, the entire DEIS is tainted by this major underlying flaw.  
This is not an abstract argument. Because the DEIS uses a flawed baseline for all other alternatives throughout the DEIS, the impacts for all other alternatives are incorrect.  
For example, the DEIS’s conclusion that dewatering would continue under baseline conditions skews the water balance conclusions. By including continued dewatering of the deep GW aquifer in No Action Alternative groundwater model predictive long-term simulations, and then subtracting drawdowns from LOM and post-closure simulations, RCM consultants have effectively biased the magnitude and extent of mine impacts on GDEs towards the low side, or the opposite of conservatively high impacts (see page 3, paragraph 4, Garrett and Newell, 2018). At a minimum, predicted drawdowns should have been calculated from pre-mining conditions, as these are the levels to which shallow ALT aquifer groundwater levels will eventually recover to. This is known without even using the highly uncertain groundwater modeling results. 
"
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," the analysis of the required “no action” alternative in the DEIS is totally inadequate. It is predicated on the premise that the no action alternative requires no real analysis, but simply repeated statements to the effect that nothing will happen were the no action alternative to be selected. Not only does this “wax museum” representation fail to recognize on-going, changing, and projected patterns of use within the project vicinity, it totally fails to acknowledge the larger context within which the proposed project would occur. The requirement to analyze the effects of the no action alternative is not satisfied by an oft-reiterated version of the statement that “nothing will happen.” The requirement for the no action alternative exists as a mechanism for comparing the environmental and related social and economic effects of the affected environment in the absence of the proposed action as compared to all of the proposed action alternatives. “Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act Regulations,” Federal Register Vol. 46, No. 55, March 1981, Question 3, “No Action Alternative.” Just as the impacts of the four alternatives are analyzed over the 20-plus years of the project life, so the “no-action” alternative must be analyzed over 20-plus years. Furthermore, the period after mine closure needs to be carefully and fully analyzed, particularly because the mine represents an irreversible commitment of resources.  

Unfortunately, in this DEIS, there is no acknowledgement of the current, on-going and project/planned changes in the overall built and natural environment. Instead, the substance of all commentary of this alternative is characterized as “none,” “not applicable,” “no impact,” “no change,” and similar phrases. The DEIS totally ignores the ecological changes that would occur, the impacts of climate change, projected patterns of visitation and use, including grazing and recreation, on the site of the proposed Resolution Copper mine.  

Moreover, the DEIS fails to recognize that substantial change will continue to occur on the balance of the Tonto National Forest as well as other public lands and private lands surrounding the project area. Consistent with local government plans and policies, significant increases in population and population distribution will occur throughout the area. Changes in the land use patterns will also occur, including, but not limited to, residential uses, commercial uses, employment centers, ranching, recreation, as well as conservation. Moreover, patterns in resource use will also change, most notably the use of increasingly scarce water resources. In effect, then, the “No Project Alternative” does not consist of a baseline suspending all change in Arizona for the duration of the projected operation of the proposed project as interpreted in the DEIS; rather, the baseline for evaluating impacts is the dynamic and changing world surrounding the proposed project. And, to realistically project conditions in the affected area without the proposed mine requires the USFS to evaluate the aggregate of local government plans, policies, population projections, capital improvement programs, etc., as well as plans for other relevant Federal, State, and local agencies.  

The analysis of the “No Action” Alternative must also address the fact that changes would be occurring incrementally over the period of mine operation. Many of the impacts would be at their most severe or greatest magnitude in the final years of mine operation. For example, growth in traffic and water use would likely be at their highest levels due to the combination of normally occurring growth combined with the proposed project. Thus the baseline for evaluating impacts in the DEIS should be the aggregate state of the environment from the initiation of operation of the proposed project through to the completion of reclamation.  

The “No Action” Alternative should properly consist of the aggregate baseline conditions and reasonably foreseeable conditions as if the proposed uses on the remaining federal lands were denied.

However, an email address is not provided for commenting on the DEIS, further restricting the available methods for public participation, contrary to the requirements contemplated at 36 C.F.R. § 219.4. TNF’s decision to refuse to provide an email address for comments eliminates the opportunity to comment via one of the most commonly available communication methods in the contemporary era. Moreover, we are concerned that individuals who previously commented using the then existing USFS email address may find out too late that this option is no longer available or they may submit comments to this email address and, absent a bounce-back, may never know that their comments were not received by TNF, further violating 36 C.F.R. §219.4.]

“When developing opportunities for public participation, the responsible official  shall take into account the discrete and diverse roles, jurisdictions, responsibilities, and skills of interested and affected parties; the accessibility of the process , opportunities, and information; and the cost, time, and available staffing. The responsible official should be proactive and use contemporary tools, such as the Internet, to engage the public, and should share information in an open way with interested parties. (emphasis added).”

Here, the requirements set for in 36 C.F.R. § 218.8(b) for filing prohibits the incorporation of documents by reference, “ except for the following list of items7 that may be referenced by including date, page, and section of the cited document, along with a description of its content and applicability to the objection. All other documents must be included with the objection .” (emphasis added). This requirement, when combined with the arbitrarily small file size (20 MB) accepted by the online portal provided to upload and submit comments , effectively bars the electronic submission of comments due to the extensive nature of all documents that must be included and, consequently large file sizes that exceed 20 MB. Because electronic submission is the most convenient submission method, these requirements make the public participation process less accessible, which violates USFS’s regulations at 36 C.F.R. § 219.4.


Additionally, these submission requirements have the greatest impact on less technically sophisticated public participants who may be unaware that their comments may not be considered due to failure to comply with technical USFS regulations. These participants will often fall into the categories that the USFS regulations specifically direct the agency to engage, such as “[y]outh, low-income, and minority populations,” and “private landowners whose lands are in, adjacent to, or otherwise affected by, or whose actions may impact, future management actions in the plan area.” 36 C.F.R. § 219.4(a)(1). In light of these serious deficiencies in the public participation process, the DEIS comment period should be extended to 180 days, the restrictions on comment submission corrected, and additional public meetings should be held in the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas

Air blasts are well known as a hazard in block caving. The air blast and associated fatalities that occurred at the Northparkes Mine in Australia in November 1999 led to a number of lessons learned, recommendations, and procedures to help prevent air blast. Precautions, such as air gap monitoring and control, that must be followed to help prevent air blast, are well known and documented, for example in the “Cave Mining Handbook”. There is no apparent reason for the TNF to have completely ignored the subject of air blast in the DEIS. Considering the size of the proposed mine, air blast prevention must be a major consideration. A new or supplemental DEIS must include air blast effects as a possible environmental impact, and that mandatory procedures to help prevent air blast must be specified in the DEIS as a mitigation.

The rates would likely be higher for this proposed project due to more highways, a much larger footprint and more mountain roads. These risks are also unacceptable. The DEIS lacks any plan to mitigate the adverse effects from increased traffic. Car pools are proposed to reduce passenger commuter traffic, but these are often not successful. The engineering of SR 77, 177, and Highway 60 near Oak Flat is inadequate and dangerous for the heavy volume of large truck traffic proposed.

  Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is an environmentally-mediated systemic infection caused by the inhalation of airborne arthroconidia from Coccidioides immitis , a soil dwelling fungus found in the southwestern United States, parts of Mexico and Central and South America. Valley Fever is not transmitted person to person. When soils containing the fungus are disturbed and dust is raised, spores may be inhaled along with the dust. Certain activities such as agriculture and construction, two large industries in Arizona, cast aloft large amounts of dust. Non-human events that act to disturb the soil include wind storms and earthquakes. 

A rough chain of events can be construed where the soil serves as the initial habitat of the fungus, human or other dust-disturbing events send dust into the atmosphere, the winds distribute the now airborne spores where they can then be inhaled by people or other animals. Dr. John Galgiani at the University of Arizona Valley Fever Center at the Tucson VA Hospital indicates that the number of cases of Valley Fever is increasing. The Center for Disease Control has C. immitis on the dangerous list as a potential bio-hazard for terrorism.

When multiple toxic substances are present, their interactions need to be addressed because the overall impact may exceed the impacts of the individual toxic substances appropriately weighted for their relative presence. A mixture of chemicals in which every chemical is below some “threshold” does not mean the mixture has no health effects, especially in the very young. Interactive effects mean that less than threshold amounts of certain chemicals will cause health problems and that means a reassessment of the limits on toxic and hazardous pollutant emissions. This requires a need to lower the stated thresholds of emission of air pollutants of 10 tons/year of a single toxic substance and 25 tons/year of all toxic substances combined. In many cases, these interactive toxic effects are enhanced by ozone and NOx.

It is a common alteration product of siliceous tuffs, and as a hydrothermal deposition product. There are known localities in Arizona which have this mineral in its geological makeup. Its fibers have recently been shown to be carcinogenic and cause mesothelioma, the form of cancer most associated with asbestos. Several government agencies, including National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Center for Disease Control (CDC) have called for special measures to prevent erionite exposure, but the DEIS makes no reference to regulations on asbestos and asbestiform minerals in the Clean Air Act requirements, but also no record of erionite or asbestiform minerals appears in the list of minerals from the Resolution Copper geochemical background documents. This does not mean that erionite or asbestiform minerals are not present, only that the background studies have not reported on them.

The average temperature in the southwest is projected to rise by 2.5 to 5.5 degrees degrees Fahrenheit by 2050.

"
"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","  Scientists are well aware that the southwest has experienced periods of unusually severe drought (e.g. a five decade mega drought) and findings suggest that similar severe drought conditions should be anticipated in an even warmer and drier future (IPCC, 2018). Until the climate dynamics of such mega droughts are fully understood, plans involving water management should be designed to accommodate a 50-year independent of the climate change impacts (e.g., temperature increase and snow decrease) that will only make the average water availability less, and the drought more severe. The DEIS should analyze the potential for 50-year mega drought in its consideration of groundwater quantity and quality and surface water quantity and quality. "
"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","In Arizona, winter precipitation is already becoming more variable with a trend toward both more frequent extremely dry and extremely wet winters (Karl, Melillo, & Peterson, 2009 ). On the global and national scale, precipitation patterns are shifting with more rain falling in heavy downpours that increase the risk of flooding. Rapid landscape transition such as that which will result from the proposed Preferred Alternative and the Proposed Action, will reduce flood-buffering capacity of the landscape and exacerbate the risk of damaging flooding. The effects of climate change will not play out on pristine systems but will interact with existing stressors on the landscape and will generally exacerbate impacts to natural resources and reduce the effectiveness of mitigation and reclamation that is designed without taking climate change impacts into consideration. 
Decadal-scale Pacific Ocean circulation persistence can result in long-term drought, which can drastically reduce water supplies as demonstrated in the extremely dry conditions between 1999 and 2005 and during the 1950s. The Southeastern Planning Area and the Active Management Area as defined by the Arizona Water Atlas (ADWR) experienced a total departure from normal of -27.6 inches and -35.1 inches, respectively, for the time period 1940-1960. While the current drought may reflect precipitation conditions similar to those of the 1950s, temperatures during the last decade are almost 2 degrees higher. This warming trend will affect the severity of drought. 
The USFS recognizes that forest management and watershed function depend on productive, porous soils. Ongoing and projected climate changes compound the effects of other factors on soil resources and increase the need for watershed treatments to restore degraded soils and stabilize sites at increased risk of erosion, loss of porosity, and loss of soil organic matter. The DEIS needs to consider the ongoing and projected climate changes in their analysis of impacts to soils. 
A revised or supplemental DEIS must analyze how these changes will affect surface water and groundwater, habitat, and dust—indeed, the entire ecosystem in which these proposed mining operations would take place.

"ALT03","Proposed New Alternative","ALT","Alternatives"," The DEIS should have included alternatives for RCM’s proposed power supply designed to reduce emissions. Preferably, an alternative would include RCM’s own renewable power generation, and hybrid heavy machinery (many mines already use hybrid equipment) to run from these renewable sources. Solar thermal power generation is already being successfully deployed in similar desert environments to provide reliable, baseload power using molten salt as an energy storage medium. Solar thermal operations utilizing dry cooling achieve major water savings over wet cooling, and should be considered for all new facilities. An SRP intertie could serve as a backup option to provide conventional energy only when RCM’s own power systems fail to do so. An alternative such as this will be an important step to showcase that a new mine does not by definition lead to increased carbon emissions. "

"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","What is the projected water consumption of the Resolution Copper Mine?
 According to Rio Tinto, the Resolution Copper Mine will consume 15,700 acre-feet per year of water at full operation with a possible maximum of 20,000 acre-feet per year (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a). This range of a maximum of 16-20,000 acre-feet per year of water consumption has been repeated at numerous community forums hosted by Rio Tinto (Resolution Copper, 2018b). Since water is recycled throughout a mining operation, water consumption can be much less than water use. Water consumption refers to water that must be replaced by withdrawals from surface water or groundwater resources. Water consumption is also called the “blue water footprint” and includes water lost by evaporation, water that is incorporated into the product (such as the copper and molybdenum concentrates), and water that is not returned to the same catchment area from which it was withdrawn (Northey and Haque, 2013). Since Rio Tinto has already provided its own projected water consumption, the second objective is equivalent to asking whether the prediction by Rio Tinto is correct.

Upper Devils Canyon streams may be base flow discharge from TAL. Well within 10’ contour. Not likely perched hydrogeo included in GW model – hence distancing by workgroup from relying on any SW-GW flow predictions. 
The DEIS doesn’t appear to consider broader impacted area (impacted areas up to for example, 1-ft drawdown vs. 10-ft) – as predicted in model, despite uncertainty band around this. More GDEs would have shown up as impacted, needing mitigation. Instead only those delineated by uncertain predicted 10-ft drawdown used (at 200 years) to define potentially impacted GDEs. 
Evaluating drawdowns in shallow aquifer at 200 years, or 148 years post-closure, severely limits the number/magnitude of impacted GDEs because the groundwater model still hasn’t fully recovered by this point. With a future fractured and highly permeable pathway that develops between the shallow Apache Leap Aquifer (ALT) and DEEP aquifer zone (in Resolution Graben), relatively rapid drainage of ALT would dewater GDEs over the short-term, as it fills voids in the deep aquifer. But then, ALT water levels will eventually return to pre-mining conditions. Choosing 200 years limits the understanding of time-varying impacts extent/magnitude.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," By including continued dewatering of the deep GW aquifer in No Action alternative groundwater model predictive long-term simulations, and then subtracting drawdowns from LOM and post-closure simulations, Resolution Copper Mine (RCM) consultants have effectively biased the magnitude and extent of mine impacts on GDEs towards the low side, or the opposite of conservatively high impacts (see page 3, paragraph 4, Garrett and Newell, 2018). At a minimum, predicted drawdowns should have been calculated from pre-mining conditions, as these are the levels to which shallow ALT aquifer groundwater levels will eventually recover to. This is known without even using the highly uncertain groundwater modeling results. 
Water quality of the ‘perched’ upper Devils Canyon drainage doesn’t appear to confirm it is disconnected to shallow ALT aquifer, which has likely dropped simply due to the substantial and long-term historical pumping, compounded by the more current 2009-present shaft 9/10 dewatering. The assessment of which GDEs to include, or discard from further analysis (i.e., discarded if perched, vs. connected to impacted ALT or Deep aquifers) appears to be based on relatively recent hydrologic data (i.e., collected after significant unrecovered historical drawdowns, 1910-1996) and superimposed re-drawdown of levels post-2009 (i.e., shaft 9/10 dewatering). No analysis of 1910 to 1996 dewatering/recovery is presented in the DEIS, or its supporting documents. Knowing how much drawdown has already occurred in the GDE locations/segments would have likely significantly increased the number of GDEs potentially impacted. 
A key question is what additional GDEs, or even those omitted because the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup decided they didn’t exhibit “persistent presence of water, year-to-year and season-to-season” (stated page 296, paragraph 3 in the DEIS), would have been valid locations had effects of past/current pumping been removed (recovered)? GDEs should have been defined based on pre-mining groundwater conditions, where the long-term pumping influence at Magma Mine, and RCM pumping since 2009 don’t bias identification of persistent discharge at springs/along streams towards the low side. Because it is unclear how the estimated pre-mining groundwater levels were determined without calibration data, the DEIS should have conservatively identified all GDEs, within uncertain range of flow conditions.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Prucha’s report notes issues with overall approach to impact evaluation as presented by the DEIS. Understanding the current hydrologic flow system and predicted changes due to mining rely heavily on modeling that involves successfully completing various sequential steps to produce reliable results agencies can use to make informed decisions. Problems with any of these steps translate into subsequent steps that reduce accuracy and reliability of results. Moreover, there are issues with the overall methodology used to evaluate impacts. A general ‘industry-standard’ approach to modeling hydrologic impacts is lacking. A general approach used to develop predictions via use of numerical models was never presented, though many guidance documents are readily available online as noted by BGC, 2018d2 in Section 2.2 (Description of Best Practices). The most useful, current and relevant to assessing mining impacts is provided by Wels, 2012 , 8 which shows a standard modeling process on Figure 1 . Clearly defined questions related to potential impacts and modeling objectives should have been presented, particularly how groundwater impacts affect surface flows, and vice-versa. These were not evaluated in this DEIS or supporting documents. Implications of the lack of a clear overall approach to hydrologic impact evaluations include the following four issues. 
One, a major flaw in modeling conducted in this DEIS is that groundwater modeling was done in apparent isolation from surface water modeling, yet surface water clearly recharges groundwater (losing segments), and groundwater clearly discharges to surface streams as baseflow, or via springs. In other words, surface water recharge to groundwater (losing stretches) was not included in the groundwater modeling as a boundary condition, and vice versa. Including this 2-way flow is essential to realistically and accurately assessing mining impacts on surrounding GDEs (and surface water ecosystems). 
Two, a formal code(s) selection process that demonstrated tools selected for the analyses adequately answer key questions/meet objectives wasn’t performed. These issues are addressed in more detail in Section 2.4 below. 
Three, once models were created, the important feedback loops shown on Figure 1 from model calibration to conceptualization and data collection doesn’t appear to have been considered. In other words, obvious data-gaps identified during modeling weren’t addressed. 
Four, a formal predictive uncertainty analysis wasn’t conducted, and partly confused with a predictive sensitivity analysis (see Wels, 2012, Proposed Groundwater Modeling Process). [See letter submittal pgs 68-88 for additional detail]

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," A formal code selection process should have been conducted to identify appropriate codes that are able to simulate all required processes needed to fully assess mine impacts on surrounding hydrology, and more importantly, to define required calibration targets for specific EIS impact assessments (i.e,. required predictive accuracy) (Technical Guide to Ground-Water Model Selection at Sites). Section 5 in Wels, 2012 provides details on conducting a formal groundwater model selection, even including a flow chart. 
The MODFLOW-Surfact groundwater modeling tool used by WSP, 2019 to assess mining impacts at GDEs within the entire mine footprint fails to model important physical processes (i.e., overland surface runoff processes, distributed recharge and evapotranspiration dynamics, stream hydrodynamics, and stream-aquifer dynamics etc.) necessary to simulate physically realistic and defensible mine impacts on surrounding GDEs. Much more robust modeling tools are readily available, but weren’t considered because a formal, industry standard code selection process wasn’t conducted, where all modeling objectives/needs are carefully defined and evaluated against capabilities of available codes. 
Fully integrated hydrologic/hydraulic codes should have been considered for more robust and physically realistic impact evaluation. These codes don’t suffer major shortcomings such as: 1) attempting to run one model in isolation (i.e., the groundwater flow model), then attempting to couple non-dynamic results to a separate spreadsheet tool, when the flows between groundwater and surface water is complex, dynamic and spatially variable, and 2) they simulate all relevant physical flow processes and don’t require unrealistic and highly uncertain boundary conditions 
Many options are commercially-available and have been applied to mine water balance projects, worldwide for many years (AquaResource Inc. 2011). 
1. Use of Modflow to explicitly model the effect of faults is inappropriate. Codes like FEFLOW permit actual simulation of flow along faults as planar features. Modflow-Surfact required specifying model cells (with variable dimensions unrelated to actual fault planes/zones in the field). Hydrogeologic characterization of flows along and/or across faults is largely missing – and therefore highly uncertain. 
2. The variable saturation, finite element modeling code, FEFLOW, developed by DHI-WASY would have allowed a much higher resolution near critical streams, while decreasing resolution in area of less interest. This would have met stated objectives. 
3. Conceptualization should have included heat transfer, due to geothermal waters encountered during construction of shaft 10, which drive density-dependent flows. FEFLOW includes the ability to simulate heat flow, and also has the ability to directly simulate 3-dimensional geochemical modeling based on PHREEQC, similar to its use in the USGS PHAST code. 
4. Fully integrated, or coupled, physically-based, fully-distributed hydrologic (and hydraulic) codes have been available for decades and would have allowed RCM consultants to directly simulate the complicated, baseline and mine-impacted coupled surface water-groundwater dynamic flow system response in a robust, realistic way. 
“The authors attempted to estimate spatial distributions of recharge, which is a complex spatially distributed, and dynamic process, using an undocumented method. However, fully integrated codes like the USGS GSFLOW code, DHI’s code MIKESHE/MIKE11 or even Aquanty’s Hydrogeosphere code actually simulate important processes like dynamic, spatially-distributed recharge, surface runoff and channelized hydrodynamics, which are dynamically coupled to subsurface flow (i.e., coupled to a modflow equivalent code). The MIKESHE code was used to simulate hourly impacts of climate change and stream temperature changes associated with Pebble Mine impacts in southeastern Alaska (Wobus, et al., 2015). “
5. Simulate ET and Recharge processes more realistically: 
● ET boundary condition – Instead of using the original MODFLOW EVT package which treats ET loss as a linear function of hydraulic head (not very physically realistic), consider using MODFLOW Riparian ET package (available for MODFLOW-2005) http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/tm6a39/pdf/tm6a39.pdf, or even the ETS package ( http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr00466 ). 
● Recharge boundary condition – See the following publication on the Basin Characterization Method (BCM) currently used by the USGS in a number of southwestern basins. ( http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1703/b/pp1703b.pdf ) or (http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5099/).

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," according to Prucha’s report, the model set-up assumptions in the DEIS are flawed. A number of issues were identified with the setup of the groundwater flow and TSF seepage flow models that severely limit confidence in a realistic range of mine impacts on the surrounding hydrologic system, including water quality impacts. There are seepage model set-up issues in the DEIS modeling of Alternative 6 Tailings Storage Facility (Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd. 2019c), which are problematic for the following six reasons. 
1. Data required to conduct realistic seepage modeling are inadequate, and introduce significant uncertainty in comparing different TSF alternatives, especially related to estimating valid and defensible impacts of each proposed TSF on the surrounding baseline hydrologic and water quality conditions. In effect, baseline conditions and characterization were not evaluated, but should have been in this DEIS to provide adequate comparison of alternatives. 
2. Only 2D simulations using the SEEP/W code were performed, when the TSF and underlying hydrogeologic system clearly exhibits 3-dimensional features which would influence groundwater-seepage flows and interaction. 
3. The model is not based on actual site data and 3-dimensional characterization of subsurface and surface hydrologic system. Instead, modeling is based on a simplified 2-d 'conceptual' configuration which doesn’t account for important features such as variable thickness of alluvium (i.e., likely thickest along actual drainages, but thinner at TSF perimeter, away from drainage thalweg). The DEIS should assess likely impacts in this area, using actual data to constrain the 3-d hydrogeology, and local groundwater and surface water conditions. A detailed and complete 3-dimensional conceptual flow model is not presented which shows how the proposed TSF interacts with the natural groundwater and surface water flow system. Centering the TSF over Dripping Springs Wash is where groundwater flow would be expected to be upwards. 
4. A no flow boundary condition is placed at the surface water divide to the north, but subsurface data is missing in this area to confirm this also coincides with a groundwater divide. 
5. Effects of faults on groundwater-seepage flows is not assessed in the area, despite the relatively high density of faults clearly evident in exposed rocks to the west, showing notable offsets and likely influential in controlling local groundwater flows below unconsolidated alluvium. 
6. No effort was made to assess impacts of stream routing/diversions around the TSF, and effects of streambed infiltration on shallow groundwater-seepage flows, and associated fate/transport of impaired waters downstream.

Had a 1-foot drawdown contour been reported in the modeling, boundary effects would have likely been far more extensive. It would likely show a much greater degree of boundary impact on the model. This boundary should have been extended outward in all directions to: 
1. Avoid influencing internal calculations. This is standard industry practice (Reilly & Harbaugh, 2004) . 
2. Simulate flow conditions for at least preferred Alternative 6 TSF, and downgradient impacts to Gila River, so that: fate and transport modeling of seepage from the TSF could have been properly assessed in Dripping Springs Wash, 
3. 2D seepage modeling could have used realistic/calibrated groundwater boundary conditions as boundary conditions on simulations estimating seepage through the TSF (Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd. 2019c).

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Prucha’s report also notes inappropriate stream-aquifer setup/assumptions in the DEIS for the proposed RCM. 
Use of MODFLOW drain package to simulate stream discharge is inappropriate for several reasons: 
1. It only permits removal of groundwater from the model, but no streambed recharge in losing river reaches. This is a major flaw in the model setup and non-standard. Many other high profile recent mining DEIS modeling efforts (i.e., Pebble Mine, Rosemont Mine) have utilized the much more robust MODFLOW stream routing packages (STR1, STR2), which actually dynamically route baseflow discharge from upper reaches to lower reaches, which permits downstream recharge in areas where underlying aquifer heads are lower than the dynamically calculated stream stage. Not accounting for streambed recharge results in either under- simulation of heads in critical GDE areas, or incorrect adjustment of other parameters (i.e., reduction in hydraulic conductivity in stream areas) to compensate for lack of focused, higher streambed recharge. 
2. Drain ‘hydraulic resistance’ or drain conductance was set ‘sufficiently high’ (see page 23, paragraph 5, WSP, 2019) so they would not exhibit resistance to flow. Even if it were acceptable to use one-way flow drain discharge to simulate river discharge, the standard modeling approach is to define drain conductance values as a primary calibration parameter. The modelers here have effectively removed a key parameter value from the calibration process and specifying high conductance prior to calibration is not valid and should be based on actual field-based measurements and careful calibration (but using a river package, and not a ‘drain’ package). 
3. No attempt appears to have been made to couple the MODFLOW drain discharge distribution with surface water modeling (BGC, 2018), so that predicted impacts due to mining on surface water flows could be better simulated, despite simulating at a monthly time period.

The decision claimed, in part, that the court found the impacts were not significantly preventing the religious practices to happen.

"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","     A second calibration problem is that adequate calibration data was lacking in the DEIS. The main focus of the DEIS is to estimate potential changes to the surface/subsurface hydrologic system, or GDEs affected by mine drawdown and changes to surface flows. Despite this objective, virtually no observation data for either surface water, or groundwater is available at, or near GDEs to constrain calibration in these critical areas. This is a major flaw in the overall model calibration approach and should have been addressed in the DEIS. Other major mine modeling efforts (i.e., see Rosemont mine, O’Brien, 2010) attempt to reproduce spatial distribution and magnitudes of observed baseflow, but the spatial distribution and long-term (i.e., multiple years) of surface water flow (or stage) data appears inadequate to assess even flow along the entire extent of the three main drainages potentially affected by the mine dewatering/TSF (Queen Creek, Mineral Creek and Devils Canyon). "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," A fourth calibration in the DEIS is that the TSF seepage modeling is unreliable. Review of the seepage modeling (Design for Alternative 6) associated with TSF alternatives (particularly #6) shows this modeling was never calibrated, because it was based on an idealized, conceptual 2-d profile, rather than using actual field-derived hydrogeologic data. It is understood that the authors of this study (at preferred alternative #6) believe conceptual modeling of this complex, but critical mine component is adequate for assessing different alternatives. But numerous assumptions were made about the subsurface and boundary conditions which would affect leakage estimates, including the implicit assumption that groundwater flows beneath the proposed TSF (for all possible future climate conditions and meteorological conditions) would never interact with internal seepage calculations, which are not conservative. The TSF and surrounding hydrogeologic system is a 3-dimensional flow system, where groundwater flows concentration beneath the central surface drainage. No surface water or groundwater data, or hydrogeologic data support the notion groundwater wouldn’t interact with the calculated seepage. If it did, this becomes critically important in subsequent evaluations of water quality impacts both during mining, and post-closure – and comparison of alternatives. Ultimately, estimates of seepage rates during mining and post-closure are not calibrated, and therefore unreliable. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The third problem with predictions in the DEIS is that the evaluation effect of geothermal water on post-closure flows and water quality were not conducted. No evaluation was presented in the DEIS or associated documents to evaluate geothermally influenced circulation within the post-closure fracture zone, which would act to circulate deep warmer waters with shallow, cooler inflow from ALT aquifer waters, driven by density variations (i.e., warmer waters rise, inducing vertical mixing). Geothermal waters were encountered in Shaft 10 (E & MJ, 2014, Sinking America’s Deepest Shaft), which surprised RCM and consultants. Often, geothermal waters are found in permeable fault zones, or where faults intersect each other (Prucha, Benson, & Witherspoon, 1987). Because multiple faults are present in the mine area, the DEIS should have required more characterization, conceptualization and use of an appropriate code capable of simulating heat transport and associated effects of density-driven circulation to better estimate long-term post-closure conditions, and water quality impacts. It’s unclear why RCM didn’t consider potential to develop the geothermal water source to offset energy requirements. "

Our scoping comments submitted on July 18, 2016 included several concerns and questions regarding the substantial water demands and water sources of the Resolution Copper mine project.

The DEIS does not meaningfully consider the implication of Arizona law on the water consumption of the proposed Resolution Copper mine. Unlike other users of groundwater in Arizona (i.e. industrial, agricultural, and residential) mines are essentially unregulated water users. Groundwater extraction permits for mines are “must issue.” As a result, they face no legal restrictions or limits on the amount of water they can pump from the aquifer. (A.R.S. § 45-514).

The net effect is that, notwithstanding the representations made today, Resolution Copper can pump as much water as they want at any point in the future and as such, the DEIS must consider this in its evaluation of impacts.

Yet without analysis, the DEIS adopts and presents this 8.1 million acre-foot figure as the amount of water “estimated to be physically available in the aquifer.” (DEIS p. 342). The DEIS never confirms where this estimate of how much water is physically available in the aquifer actually comes from, whether it has been independently verified, what the range of uncertainty is, or any of the discussions which would otherwise accompany verifications being done as a proper part of NEPA analysis.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Also noted as problematic in the deis are inappropriate seepage setup/assumptions. Springs and seeps do not appear to have been simulated as discharge points in the Modflow model. It would have been appropriate, and is typical, to use the Modflow Drain package to simulate discharge at these areas. Not simulating discharge in these areas would cause the model to overestimate heads otherwise controlled by discharge to seeps/springs. 
Areal Recharge Specification Inappropriate: 
1. books have been written on the subject – it is complex, but critical to acceptable calibration (Healy and Scanlon, 201014). The USGS15 has developed a commonly used method called the Basin Characterization Method (BCM) to estimate recharge based on many known factors. 
2. Factors that Schlumberger indicates control recharge (slope and geologic ‘infiltration multipliers) are only some of the factors actually determining recharge at any given cell. No references to this estimation of recharge are provided, yet this is a critical model input, typically strongly correlated with hydraulic conductivity, and influencing calibration. 
3. Recharge zonation into upper and lower zones, and ‘enhanced recharge’ zones along Queen Creek and Devils Canyon (see paragraph 1, page 25, WSP, 2019) is arbitrary and unjustified, and has significant effects on calibration. WSP, 2019 states “These zones were conceptualized to concentrate runoff that would lead to higher infiltration rates, which were set at 4% and 8% for the lower and higher elevation areas, respectively. As runoff is concentrated in these areas, water is stored in surface soils longer, providing more time for infiltration and hence a higher recharge rate.” This statement is physically incorrect, as streambed recharge occurs only along streams, as indicated in Simmers, 198816. Moreover, the aerial recharge specified in the model (Figure 3.6, WSP, 2019) incorrectly assigns high recharge within a nearly ½ mile wide zone around each of these key mine-impacted drainages, which causes too much recharge in these areas, and in turn reduces mine impacts. If the model had been calibrated against surface flows (both discharge and recharge), along with a proper number of wells along each of these drainages, recharge in these areas would have been much better constrained. This is a major problem in the DEIS, which focuses on assessing mine-impacts to these very drainages. 
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Another problem Prucha’s report identified was that the actual evapotranspiration (AET) from groundwater is not simulated. Calculation of AET is in fact, a critical water balance component in most hydrologic models, and a complicated function of complex climate inputs (generally accounted for in more robust estimates of PET, like the standard ASCE or FAO Penman-Monteith equation17), soil properties (i.e., soil types, layering, moisture contents, unsaturated zone hydraulic properties), precipitation, groundwater depths with time, and vegetation properties (i.e., leaf area index, root depth density with depth, crop coefficients, types, saturation, residual and field and wilting point moistures, canopy properties etc). In single-process codes like MODFLOW, AET is typically simulated either using the standard EVT package, which calculates AET on a cell- by-cell basis, as a function of groundwater depth, maximum evapotranspiration rates, and plant root depths, or by specifying net-recharge, where AET is calculated on a cell by cell basis, and then removed from applied recharge. Importantly, assessing sub-daily impacts at specific locations in the model is strongly influenced by correct calculation of AET. In riparian zones, groundwater loss to AET and baseflow discharge compete against each other, as a function of groundwater depth. Consequently, without directly simulating AET in all cells, groundwater models likely overestimate baseflow loss, and incorrectly parameterize stream- aquifer conductance values. Omitting this critical process (a conceptual error, especially in semi-arid climates) prevents estimation of mine impacts on phreatophyte-dependent riparian vegetation. This is a major oversight in the DEIS evaluation of impacts at GDEs. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","another problem Prucha’s report noted was that the subsidence was not evaluated – Salt River Valley ADWR Model. No effort was made to estimate subsidence in the important Phoenix AMA area, though drawdowns are estimated and subsidence potential acknowledged. Garrett 2018 states on page 9, paragraph 2: 
”Long-term drawdown from Desert Wellfield pumping of 10 to 30 feet is modeled to occur in the nearby known subsidence areas. Any groundwater pumping within a groundwater basin with known subsidence has the potential to contribute to that subsidence, including the pumping from the Desert Wellfield. Further detailed analysis is not feasible beyond noting the potential for any pumping to contribute to drawdown and subsidence. Subsidence effects are a basin-wide phenomenon, and analytical tools do not exist to isolate the impact from one individual pumping source on subsidence.” 
The Modflow Subsidence package (Höffmann, Leake, Galloway, & Wilson, 2003) could easily have been used to assess the likely impacts of MARRCO pumping on subsidence. 
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Another problem identified in the DEIS by Prucha was that the evaluation of future drawdown at the surrounding wells was not conducted. About 285 wells (ADWR database) would be impacted within the 10’ drawdown (at 200 years), and more than 400 wells would probably be impacted by drawdowns of at least 1 foot. This is easily done with a properly calibrated model and predictive uncertainty analysis. Newell and Garrett 2018 state, page 10, paragraph 3 “In lieu of analyzing individual wells, typical wells in key communities were analyzed using the groundwater flow model, including wells near Top-of-the-World (using well HRES-06 as a proxy), wells within the town of Superior (using well DHRES-16 as a proxy), and wells near Boyce Thompson Arboretum (using the Gallery well as a proxy).” Proxies give a misleading sense of impacts to surrounding wells because drawdown is spatially complex. The DEIS should have evaluated a range of maximum drawdowns (given uncertainty in predictions) in all wells, regardless of the amount. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A number of model calibrations problems in the DEIS were identified in Prucha’s report that show the model calibrations to be unreliable. First, the calibration approach was flawed and non-unique. Calibrating groundwater flow models to only hydraulic heads, which are spatially biased with higher density near the proposed mine, and sparse further from the mine is well known to produce non-unique solutions (Castro & Goblet, 2003). The non-unique solution is typical of groundwater models where recharge and hydraulic conductivity values are highly correlated (Jvrkama & Sykes, 2006). Doherty and Hunt (2010) indicate that non-unique solutions can be addressed by adding other types of calibration data (i.e., surface water discharge, water quality data etc). Representing seasonally dynamic gaining/losing surface water flows as ‘drain’ cells in the groundwater model, fails to account for stream recharge in losing reaches. This in turn forces incorrect adjustments of hydraulic parameter values to compensate, and further degrades calibration and therefore reliability of the groundwater model for predictions. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A third problem in the DEIS identified by Prucha with regard to calibration regards pre-mining conditions and periods from 1910 to 1996 that were uncalibrated. The approach to determining pre-mining initial 3-dimensional heads (1910) for 39 model layers was never presented in the WSP, 2019 modeling report, but the DEIS really should have required detailed description of these conditions and how they were derived, and associated errors. They are critical to assessing the nature of long-term post-closure groundwater recovery, rather than attempting to assess recovery relative to the start of RCM pumping in 2009, which already induces a substantial drawdown response, superimposed on the partially-recovered heads from 1910 to 1996 pumping. This is essential information in conservatively assessing mine impacts on GDEs. 
From 1910 to 1996, the model appears uncalibrated (no reporting on this in DEIS, or WSP, 2019 report) even the historical pumping locations are largely unknown (KEAY, 2010) which likely introduces substantial error into the calibration, and further uncertainty in predictions, as the heads by start of RCM pumping in 2009 were no-where-near recovered to pre-mining conditions. 
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A final problem noted by Prucha with calibration modeling in the DEIS is that the presentation of calibration results is incomplete and/or misleading. Model performance and reliability based on model-wide calibration statistics of only head data gives a misleading and unreliable sense the model is adequately calibrated for intended purpose of evaluating impacts at GDEs. For the high degree of hydrogeologic complexity of the subsurface system, including multiple offset faults, perched, shallow and deep aquifer units and historically complex dewatering in the area, the number, locations and depths of calibration targets is inadequate, particularly in key target GDE areas, the main focus of the groundwater modeling evaluation. For example, Table 3.6 in the WSP, 2019 report indicates Residual Mean in the Apache Leap Tuff is -14 ft, indicating on average, the model overestimates heads in this shallow aquifer. Yet, closer inspection of transient well hydrographs included in Appendix C of WSP, 2019 closer to surface drainages (i.e., DHRES-08, DHRES-10, DHRES-11, DHRES-12, DHRES-17 and DHRES-18) indicates simulated differences more than 100 to more than 600+ feet. 
1. Spatial Bias in Calibration:The WSP, 2019 report shows calibration ‘Scatter Plots’ (see Figures 3.9 and 3.10), but never show spatial bias and residuals at specific wells by aquifer unit. This is essential for assessing calibration error (residuals) at specific GDE locations, generally along streams. 
2. Hydraulic Tests: Calibration to 2 aquifer hydraulic tests appear to reproduce drawdowns in several wells, and even anisotropic drawdown trend, but the mine dewatering will continue for several decades, and these hydraulic tests have limited value: 
3. Tests are far too small. A stress on the aquifer to confirm parameterization, assumed boundary conditions for most of the GDEs. 
4. These tests already confirm aquifer response in spatially-biased high density of mine wells. 
5. These tests don’t confirm influence of all faults included in the model. It would have been far more instructive to conduct tests, monitoring hydraulic response on both sides of important bounding faults (or faults that act as preferential conduits of groundwater flow. 
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Another problem identified by Prucha is that the DEIS makes many misleading or incomplete predictions with no supporting documents. The first is that the predicted change from the proper “Baseline Conditions” is biased. Historical Magma Mine pumping occurred from 1910 to 1998. RCM pumping started in 2009 (WSP, 2019). WSP states (page 4, paragraph 6) “Water levels had recovered to approximately 2,200 ft amsl by the time dewatering was resumed on March 17, 2009”. This clearly indicates the groundwater levels in the vicinity had not fully recovered, and therefore do NOT represent a proper baseline, or pre-mining condition. Pre-mining Furthermore, it is likely streamflows (and springs) in the area that would have been impacted by historical Magma Mine pumping, and which would have recovered had RCM not restarted pumping in 2009, would have increased the number of baseline GDEs in the area (i.e., Devil’s Canyon stream from DC10.9 to DC15). Pre-mining (baseline) heads for the Tal shallow aquifer are presented in WSP 2019, but no discussion of associated interaction of groundwaters with surface waters during this period is presented. The DEIS should have evaluated the proposed RCM mine dewatering and post-closure crater subsidence related to this condition, as the Magma mine dewatering would presumably have recovered to near these levels. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The second problem is that the predicted flow through the fractured crater in the DEIS is limited because of model instability. Page 38, paragraph 1 WSP 2019 indicates that hydraulic conductivities within the fractured crater were limited to only 100 ft/day due to instabilities in the model, if assigned higher values. The fracturing likely produces much higher conductivity values than 100 ft/day, which would enhance vertical drainage from the overlying shallow Tal aquifer due to block caving. The DEIS should require detailed assessment of hydraulic response (or recovery for post-closure) to better assess impacts of this important post-closure condition. It is possible the recovery of water levels post- closure would have been much quicker, leading to better estimates of drawdown and GDE impacts (instead of limiting impacts to 148 years after closure, and 10’ drawdown contours). "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A fourth problem with predictions in the DEIS is that clear disclosure of full hydraulic impacts is missing. Montgomery & Associates, 2017, Page ES-6, states “However, the Magma Mine workings do extend west of the fault, providing the potential for hydraulic impacts to extend beyond the fault.” A clear description and explanation of the final 3-d mine closure configuration is never presented. It is apparent that WSP failed to account for the change in land surface in their modeling (~800 to 1100 feet). This is a critical oversight in the DEIS, because had a proper future-condition conceptual model been developed showing the 800 to 1000 ft drop in land-surface, it would have required a similar change in the calibrated model. Simulating long-term (steady state to avoid uncertainty associated with the time it takes for system to recover to pre-mining conditions) post- closure conditions would very likely have shown development of a pitlake (see Section 2.7.7). This is a major impact to the system which the DEIS failed to address. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A fifth problem with predictions is the inappropriate predictions of post-closure impacts in the DEIS. WSP, 2019, Page 4, Paragraph 4 states “As water level recovery within the block cave is slow, some areas show additional drawdown continuing to propagate outward after 200 years as steady state equilibrium conditions have not yet been re-established.” Prediction of post-closure hydrologic conditions at an arbitrarily chosen 200 years (or 148 years after closure) is very misleading and incorrectly conveys what will really occur at final steady state conditions. The modeling report suggests even at 148 years post-closure, drawdown is still occurring, due to slow/low recharge, though the flawed calibration/non-unique solution produce model results so uncertain SW discharge is not relied on. Clearly the 200 years should not have been arbitrarily used to assess long-term final impact w/uncertain model. These biases estimated drawdown impacts at GDEs towards the low side (not conservatively high as suggested in the WSP study. By comparison, the modeling conducted for the Rosemont DEIS demonstrated Steady State conditions were achieved at streams of interest (at 1000 years out). This continued drawdown by itself should have alerted modeling group to insist on simulating much longer, or steady state post-closure.  "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","  	A sixth problem with predictions in the DEIS is the use of a 10-foot drawdown contour is misleading or biased (or both). At least a simulated long-term 1-foot drawdown contour should have been used in the identification of GDEs. GDEs, or private wells experiencing even a 1’ drawdown could have significant negative impacts. A simulated 1-foot drawdown contour (or lower) was never shown in the DEIS, but probably shows significant effects of model boundary effects, implying the model extent should have been expanded to avoid any influence over internal calculations as is standard modeling practice. Using the 10-foot drawdown contour to define impacts is highly biased, and likely removes many GDEs from further evaluation of impacts/mitigation. The explanation that drawdowns less than 10-feet are imprecise in the DEIS (see page 301) is flawed. Groundwater models are precise, but suffer from accuracy issues. The accuracy at 1-foot drawdown is the same as 10-feet. A predictive uncertainty analysis would effectively provide a means of adding a +/- around drawdown contours. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","A seventh problem with predictions in the DEIS is the assessment of potential pitlake developments/impacs is flawed. Pitlake Development. WSP 2019 states on Page 1, Paragraph 2 that ‘the potential for a pit lake will be assessed’. Yet the modeling study failed to present any further details on the potential for a pitlake to develop, and to then characterize and evaluate the impacts of the pitlake on surrounding flows and water quality. Page 376-377 in the DEIS do describe the ‘Potential for Subsidence Lake Development’, explored by the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup, but the DEIS states on page 377 “Ultimately the Forest Service determined that the presence of a subsidence lake was speculative and not reasonably foreseeable, and as such it would therefore be inappropriate to analyze in the EIS” Table 3.7.2-7 provides an overview of predicted water levels after 1000 years and the DEIS concludes “groundwater levels are still at least 200 feet below the bottom of the subsidence crater”. 
However, there are two key reasons why it is likely a pit lake would form post- closure: 
1. The flow model is highly uncertain, and non-unique due to calibration to only groundwater head data, and not other common calibration datasets (i.e, surface discharge, water quality etc) that would reduce non-uniqueness. As a result, estimated water level recovery at 1000 years is highly uncertain, and levels would likely recover much quicker. 
More importantly, conceptually, it is easy to argue that the groundwater levels will eventually recover to pre-mining levels (steady state), and at least to currently monitored levels, known to be influenced by Shaft 9/10 pumping since 2009. In fact, these recovered levels, at wells DHRES-01 and DHRES-02 within the crater, exceed 3650 ft, MSL for various screened zones (see observed levels in WSP 2019 report, Appendix C for different well screen zones). According to DEIS Figure 3.7.2-4, these recovered levels would be more than 650 feet above the 1100 ft subsidence crater land surface, and more than 350 feet above the 800 ft land surface elevations (3000 ft, and 3300 ft, respectively). 
2. WSP, 2019 failed to include the change in the ground surface due to the crater in the future condition groundwater modeling. Conservatively, they should have dropped the surface 1100 ft, and let the groundwater model simulate eventual development of the subsidence crater, which would, like the Rosemont mine DEIS modeling that also showed long-term development of a pitlake, change the long-term, or eventual groundwater flow regime. More importantly, with continued evaporation, the pitlake waters would likely also significantly change predicted long-term water quality predictions and risks in the area of this pitlake. 
3. Figure 1 from Meza-Cuadra, 2018 was revised to reflect conceptually what the WSP, 2019 groundwater model should have simulated (change in land surface), and the eventual development of a pitlake as groundwater levels recover. WSP should have included this type of Future Processes Conceptual Model, which is industry standard (see Potential Errors in Conceptual Modeling, Section 4.6 in Wels, 20129 ). Rosemont DEIS groundwater modeling of the development of a pitlake was developed using Modflow-Surfact coupled to a dynamic systems model using the GoldSim code (Roemer, et al., 2018). 
Given the strong evidence to suggest formation of a pit lake, the Forest Service should have included in the DEIS the long term impacts associated with this strong possibility. In any arid environment where evaporation exceeds precipitation, pit lakes become evaporative sinks, drawing water in from surrounding groundwater which causes a cone of depression, and resulting in permanent evaporative loss from the pitlake surface. Water that would otherwise be available for humans and the natural environment are permanently lost.

As noted below, analyze pit lake water quality, as pit lakes tend to evapo-concentrate over time, leading to ever-worsening water quality 5.) analyze worsening pit lake water quality on adjacent groundwater over the long term.

"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," The eighth problem with predictions in the DEIS is the missing predictive uncertainty evaluation. The Groundwater Modeling Workgroup appeared to acknowledge uncertainty in their modeling predictions of drawdown extent, but then failed to provide a range of predictions for all predictions. Other modeling efforts also appear to have failed to consider any type of predictive uncertainty, despite substantial calibration errors and high input uncertainty. The DEIS should have required a comprehensive approach to dealing with any modeling uncertainty in all model predictions. All of the models developed and referenced in this DEIS (and supporting documents) have numerous assumptions and inputs, each of which translate into prediction uncertainty, but none address the substantial uncertainty in the predictions, let alone even identifying and tracking all sources of uncertainty. 
Impacts of the proposed Desert Wellfield pumping wells near the proposed MARRCO corridor were evaluated by Bates et al, 2018 using ADWR’s 2009 Salt River Valley (SRV) model (Freihoefer, et al., 2009). The ADWR SRV modeling effort never included a predictive uncertainty evaluation, nor did the predictive modeling by Bates et al, 2018. This would have been well warranted in the proposed pumping area, as data used to support the model construction are clearly absent in this area. As a result, predictions using this model, in this area, are expected to exhibit high uncertainty relative to other areas in their model domain, which had much greater data to justify model construction. 
The evaluation of hydrologic model prediction uncertainty is critical, yet modelers confused sensitivity evaluation for standard/formal predictive uncertainty analysis. It is important to note that the non-uniqueness of the groundwater flow model calibration (remembering that it was only calibrated to heads and not discharge, water quality etc.) leads to many equally valid predictive solutions. Therefore, the assessment of the range of possible impacts of the mine on surrounding hydrology (and water quality) is inadequate and unreliable. It is misleading and incorrect to assume flawed or unreliable model simulated drawdowns above 10 feet are accurate, and those below are inaccurate. GDEs are very sensitive to groundwater levels – and even a 1-foot change will likely significantly change spring/river discharge or even presence. Gabora et al, 201435 appropriately used a Monte Carlo method to predict an entire range of simulated pit model inflows, while maintaining calibration. 
The reliability of the model findings is implicitly tied to the accuracy of the model, which by default is uncertain, like all models. Model accuracy can be improved by collecting more data, increasing discretization and better reproducing observations, but in reality, this is impossible to achieve, given that models are simplifications of flow systems, and data will always be limited. As such, it is far more important for RCM consultants to acknowledge uncertain model predictions, and instead conduct a detailed and robust predictive uncertainty analysis which focuses not just on predicted groundwater inflow to the pit lake, but also on predicted response at all other mine components, at the same time. A sensitivity analysis (ASTM D5611, 2016) does not provide a range of possible predicted responses given ranges of uncertain model inputs like an uncertainty analysis, which constrains realizations to maintain calibration within acceptable targets (Doherty, 2010). 
Modelers appear to have confused a predictive sensitivity analysis with a predictive uncertainty analysis. The distinction is very important, as a sensitivity analysis does not provide a true assessment of model uncertainty (see Neuman & Weiranga, 2003, Doherty et al, 2010)—typically perturbations cause the model to fall out of calibration, which make the results unreliable. Yet the authors report a range of output from simulations using an arbitrary adjustment of selective (i.e., cherry picked) parameters, to imply they’ve considered the full range of possible impacts at GDEs. Despite the modelers using the PEST code (described by code author Doherty, 2010) to help refine model calibration (see page 27, WSP, 2019), they failed to use the same code to conduct a predictive uncertainty analysis. 
The failure of this DEIS to require formal uncertainty analyses for all of the modeling predicting impacts to the surrounding environment/GDEs is a major oversight. As Doherty et al, 2010 states “Central to any decision-making process is an assessment of risk. Such an assessment is impossible without some assessment of predictive uncertainty.”, which clearly supports the need for some type of uncertainty analysis to qualify predictions. 
Ultimately, model predictions of impacts on GDEs are considered highly uncertain, due to a combination of the high level of input uncertainty, high conceptual model uncertainty, uncertainty in calibration data, and notable model error. While it appears that the groundwater modeling workgroup has acknowledged that the results are uncertain, especially with distance from the mine operations, further evaluation of uncertainty was dismissed in favor of selective sensitivity evaluations (Meza-Cuadra et al, 2018). Conducting a simplified sensitivity evaluation and then claiming it represents model uncertainty is misleading and understates the value of conducting a formal uncertainty analysis (at GDEs). An uncertainty analysis, which maintains calibration constraints by adjusting individual/combinations of model inputs, defines a range of equally valid predictions to which the solution is most sensitive. Sensitivity analysis identify parameters that predictions are most sensitive to, but do not bracket a realistic range of equally possible solutions that meet objective function constraints (i.e., minimizing the difference between historical and simulated heads), and as such shouldn’t be used in lieu of a constrained uncertainty analysis. Conducting a formal uncertainty analysis and providing a qualified range of potential impacts, provides a much better way to inform critical decisions related to mine permitting 
The null space Monte Carlo Constrained Maximization/Minimization method (Doherty et al, 2010) can provide the very important result of conveying the range (maximum – minimum) of equally plausible predictions of impacts at GDEs. The current sensitivity analysis is a) too selective and doesn’t consider combinations of sensitive parameters and b) isn’t constrained to minimize objective function (i.e., reproducing historical conditions within some value). 
The well-known parameter estimation code PEST can be used in conjunction with existing calibrated groundwater models to determine a full range of uncertainty in predicted effects on GDEs using the Null-Space Monte Carlo method (see Doherty et al, 2010). The choice of the target or threshold objective function level at which the model is deemed to be “calibrated” is often subjective (Though targets should be determined based on required accuracy in GDE areas of interest following, for example a baseline study of this flow system that defines minimum environmental flows or changes to the hydrologic/ecologic system, to avoid irreversible damage). 
Doherty et al, 2010 states “The principle that underlies this methodology is illustrated in his figure 6 for a two-parameter system. In this figure, the shaded contour depicts a region of optimized parameters that correspond to the minimum of the objective function. The solid lines depict objective function contours; the value of each contour defines the objective function for which parameters become unlikely at a certain confidence level. Each contour thus defines the constraint to which parameters are subject as a prediction of interest is maximized or minimized in order to define its post-calibration variability at the same level of confidence. The dashed contour lines depict the dependence of a prediction on the two parameters. The constrained maximization/minimization process through which the post- calibration uncertainty of this prediction is explored attempts to find the two points marked by circles on the constraining objective function contour. These points define parameter sets for which the prediction of interest is as high or as low as it can be, while maintaining respect for the constraints imposed by the calibration process.”

Furthermore, given ADWR’s status as a cooperating agency, the DEIS should have (but completely failed to) analyze the water management actions by that agency and how those may affect and be affected by this project, including the Management Plans required under the 1980 Groundwater Code which was enacted to “aggressively manage the state’s finite groundwater resources.” Under the 10 Groundwater Code, areas of the state with ”heavy reliance on mined groundwater” were designated as Active Management Areas (AMAs), and for many AMAs including the Phoenix AMA, ”the primary management goal is safe-yield by the year 2025.”1 1 T he c urrent mine infrastructure ”lies almost entirely within the Phoenix AMA” (DEIS p. 312), and the desert wellfield is ”within the East Salt River valley subbasin of the Phoenix AMA” (DEIS p. 18).

"3.7.01","Water Resources: Groundwater Pumping","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","      It is well-documented and researched that excessive, long-term extraction of groundwater can cause subsidence and fissures in the earth. These occurrences have been particularly concentrated in the East Salt River Valley subbasin, where over 500,000 AF of water would be pumped under the preferred Alternative 6. Regarding the East Salt River Valley subbasin, ADWR’s Water Planning Atlas states: “Earth fissuring and subsidence have occurred in the ESRV sub-basin due to localized pumping. These occurrences are found near Apache Junction and in the vicinities of Queen Creek, North Scottsdale and Paradise Valley (Rascona, 2005).”1 3 The University of Arizona’s Water Resources Research Center states: “Within the Salt River Valley are various locations where subsidence is occurring.”1 4 
The DEIS (p. 334) contains no meaningful analysis of the potential subsidence from its large water uses, saying only that while groundwater pumping has already caused land subsidence in the wellfield area, a detailed analysis of land subsidence caused by withdrawals from this project is “not feasible” and that the impacts from one pumping source “cannot be predicted or quantified.” This is not a full nor a fair discussion of the potential environmental impacts caused by the large volume of proposed pumping in this area as required by 40 C.F.R. § 1502.1. Nor does any part of this discussion cite to supporting evidence, as required by 40 C.F.R. § 1502.1 (requiring that statements “shall be supported by evidence that the agency has made the necessary environmental analyses.”) Since subsidence due to water use is not analyzed in this DEIS, the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from that subsidence (such as the impacts of subsidence on the U.S. 60, S.R.79, and other nearby roadways, ground instability, impacts to wildlife, impacts to existing and planned infrastructure, etc.) are all absent from the DEIS. Drawdown contours are shown in Figure 3.7.1-2 (DEIS p. 298) which overlay nearby roadways and developed areas, but the impacts of these drawdowns on those features are never analyzed in the DEIS. 
The DEIS (p. ES-24) states that desert wellfield pumping in the East Salt River Valley MARRCO corridor “would incrementally contribute to the lowering of groundwater levels and cumulatively reduce overall groundwater availability in the area” but the DEIS contains no meaningful analysis of impacts or plans for mitigation. As discussed further herein in these comments, Resolution Copper’s water recharge and storage credits, which are “not required under Arizona water law” and a “voluntary measure” (DEIS p. 341) are non-binding by definition. They can be freely sold or exchanged at any time, and cannot and should not be relied on for mitigation. Yet the DEIS improperly relies on them ( see DEIS p. 333, stating “[t]he applicant-committed environmental protection measures include remedying any impacts on water supply wells caused by drawdown from the project.”)

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","      	The groundwater model for the MARRCO wellfield is deficient. Although Resolution Copper purportedly intends to pump 540,000 acre-feet of water from groundwater resources (under the preferred Alternative 6, DEIS p. 99), the DEIS makes no attempt whatsoever to model or estimate groundwater resources and thus, makes no attempt to study the cumulative impacts. This is a glaring and quite unbelievable deficiency in the DEIS. The DEIS (p. 303) states that the groundwater flow model to predict pumping impacts from the MARRCO corridor desert wellfield was built by Resolution Copper “from an existing, calibrated, regulatory model prepared by ADWR” and, since the original model had been used for planning purposes since the 1990s, the modified model “did not require as extensive a review as the models prepared specifically for the mine.” This is absurd, modifications to the existing model are not described. The original model may be reliable, but a new model should have been subjected to the same thorough review in the DEIS. Insufficient data is provided regarding the groundwater flow model on the MARRCO wellfield. The DEIS (p. 303) under the section titled “Model Used for Mine Water Supply Pumping Effects” indicates that Resolution Copper built a model from an existing ADWR model for this area. The DEIS states that a less extensive review was given to this model, yet doesn’t give an explanation why, or what this lower-level review supposedly entailed. Resolution Copper has taken an ADWR model and modified it or updated it in some way and no discussion appears anywhere in the DEIS about how this model was changed. Furthermore, ADWR has recently finalized a new groundwater model for this area, correcting errors and shortcomings in the older model. The model reflects a “major update” performed by ADWR in 2014, “structural modifications” made in order to “address differences found between the simulated thickness of the aquifer materials and the thickness described in numerous well drillers’ logs.”1 5 According to the 2019 Pinal Model Technical Memorandum, “[c]hanges were also made in the East Salt River Valley (SRV) portion of the SRV model” based on significant structural modifications.1 6 The DEIS (p. 300) says that groundwater model results “could be reasonably assessed up to 200 years” but this statement is couched in multiple qualifiers with no explanation given for why only 200 years is the threshold. Additionally, although it is common scientific practice to do so, no range of uncertainty (such as ± 10-15 years, for example) accompanies this figure. This figure is relied upon as the basis for all quantitative results in the DEIS, but it is not a reliable figure. Furthermore, the vague expression of the estimated point of maximum groundwater drawdown or impact as “decades or even centuries” is a huge unusable range, and completely unreliable. A map (or discussion) of the groundwater model area boundaries for the East Salt River Valley analysis area are never provided. The DEIS (p. 298) claims that figure 3.7.1-2 shows the groundwater model boundaries/analysis area of the East Salt River valley model. However, figure 3.7.1-2 (p. 298), below, shows only a zoomed-in, limited portion of this groundwater model area – making it impossible to know what the analysis area does or does not include. 15 The The DEIS contains no meaningful discussion whatsoever about the accuracy of the groundwater model. The DEIS contains multiple assurances that the groundwater model is precise since it produces results with “many decimal points” (p. 301). The DEIS states that the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup only assessed the groundwater model results for precision. This is not a scientifically sufficient way to evaluate results – both accuracy and precision are required which are totally independent concepts and not to be used interchangeably (as is done in BGC Engineering USA Inc. 2018d). “Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1. This DEIS fails to meet this requirement. As shown below, the analysis area of the water quality model omits critical segments of Queen Creek. Figure 3.7.2-1 shows what is included in the water model analysis area studied under this section (supposedly encompassing where groundwater or surface water quality changes could potentially occur under the project). The area studied is extremely insufficient for many reasons, including that only about half of the length of Queen Creek between the block-cave zone and Whitlow Dam is included in the analysis area, despite Resolution Copper having an AZPDES permit No. AZ0020389 for nearly ten years to discharge mine wastewater into the unstudied portion of Queen Creek. The DEIS does not address why this study failed to include such a large portion of Queen Creek, but this is an extremely unscientific, glaring omission which fails to comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 1502.16 and the very first requirement on the list of requirements for an EIS at Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA (P.L. 91-190).

“As part of the implementation of the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan in Arizona, water stakeholders, including the State of Arizona, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) cities and Tribes in the state, agreed to fund the development of groundwater infrastructure in Pinal County to supplant the loss of Colorado River water under DCP and during shortage on the Colorado River. The stakeholders agreed to help fund rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of new wells sufficient to provide 16,500 Acre-Feet of water in 2022 and 70,000 Acre-Feet of water in 2023 and thereafter.

In January, the Arizona legislature approved, and the Governor signed, a $9 Million appropriation from the state specifically for rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of new wells as part of the DCP approval legislation . In addition, CAP authorized the use of $5 Million of its revenues to be used for groundwater infrastructure . CAP also justified their appropriation as an investment in stored CAP water currently in Pinal County, with the expectation that the water will be called upon during shortage. This recovery of stored water should also be considered a Reasonably Foreseeable Activity. The Pinal County farmers currently expect to raise $25 Million, including the appropriations from the state and CAP, with the goal of seeking federal funding for an additional $25 Million through NRCS, USDA and possibly Reclamation. In the meantime, their supporters in the legislature continue to seek additional state funds to be used if the federal funding does not materialize ( see video of the hearing, here ).”

Statement, August 2019
(See Maest’s report with the same title in the Appendix)
The primary mined materials that could adversely affect water quality are the mine tailings, development rock, and the rock remaining in the block cave zone, where the ore and development rock would be extracted according to the study done by geochemical and water resources expert, Dr. Ann Maest (see Maest’s Review of Geochemical Issues of Resolution Copper’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement, August 2019). Mine-influenced waters that could adversely affect streams, groundwater, and springs include contact stormwater, tailings seepage and supernatant water, and water in the block cave zone or that could enter the block cave zone and underground workings during or after mining. 
"
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","  The DEIS says it used “best practices” for geochemical characterization by using methods from INAP and those required by ADEQ (p. 372). However, two methods used will underestimate acid generation and contaminant leaching potential: the Sobek method (Sobek et al., 1978) and the synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP; US EPA, 1994). The original Sobek method (Sobek et al., 1978) could overestimate acid generation potential because it uses total sulfur rather than sulfide sulfur. However, for the Resolution Copper Project, only the sulfide sulfur was used (MWH Americas, Inc., 2013, p. 2-4). Use of the original Sobek method in this case is more likely to overestimate neutralization potential because of the pH endpoint (Maest et al., 2005). The Modified Sobek method is recommended over the original Sobek method by INAP (2009) and the Nevada Bureau of Land Management (2013). Because most of the test results for Resolution Copper showed that nearly all the mine rock samples, all the PAG tailings, and over half the “NPAG” tailings were potentially acid-generating (PAG; DEIS, p. 372 and 373), the use of the older Sobek method is not particularly concerning for the DEIS. However, it should not be used in the field to distinguish PAG and NPAG rocks for different placement and different mitigation approaches; instead, the Modified Sobek method should be used. No information is provided in the DEIS about methods used in the field to distinguish PAG and NPAG rock (read project description etc.). An important question is why the DEIS calls the “NPAG” tailings (scavenger tailings) NPAG when half are PAG or acid generating (DEIS, p. 373). 
The SPLP test will underestimate the leaching potential of mined materials, especially in arid areas like southern Arizona, because it calls for a 20:1 solution:solid ratio (Maest et al., 2005). The meteoric water mobility procedure (MWMP) is recommended by the Bureau of Land Management for the State of Nevada, another arid state in the western US. The MWMP has a solution:solid ratio of 1:1 and should have been used by the proponents to evaluate the short-term contaminant leaching potential of mined materials. As noted in the DEIS (p. 381), a drawback of relying only on the SPLP test is that it is usually conducted on unweathered fresh core or lab-created tailings when in the field over time, these mined materials will weather. As especially sulfidic mine materials weather, secondary sulfate salts are formed that can release metal(oid)s, sulfate, and acidity rapidly during a storm event or as waters rise into mined areas; the effects of this rapid dissolution are rarely taken into account when predicting mine waste behavior (Maest and Nordstrom, 2017 and references contained therein).

"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","  	The proposed mining is expected to result in an enormous collapsed and fractured area predicted to be 7,000 feet deep with an overlying crater that will develop starting in year 6 of mining (DEIS, p. ES-3, p. 26). The crater is expected to be between 800 to 1,115 ft deep and approximately 1.8 miles wide at the surface of Oak Flat (DEIS, p. ES-3). The collapsed and cratered area will likely result in flow reductions in Devil’s Canyon and Queen Creek and the loss of seeps and springs in the Superior area (DEIS, p. 26). The two competing geochemistry models presented in the DEIS have radically different water quality predictions for groundwater quality in the block cave zone, as shown in Table 1. Once explanation for the discrepancy is that chemical weathering of wall rock and mineralized fractured rock in the collapsed block-cave zone is assumed in the Eary (2018f) model to not supply any chemical load to the sump water (DEIS, p. 350). However, the results presented MWH Americas (2013) and interpreted in the section Block Cave Groundwater After Mining Ceases in this memo completely contradict that assumption and show that acidity, copper, and sulfate can be released from oxidized mineralized rock in the block cave zone when water levels rise. "
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","  The DEIS admits that after closure, the reflooded block-cave zone could have poor water quality; however, it concludes that a lake in the subsidence crater is not anticipated, and no other exposure pathways exist for this water (DEIS p. ES-24, pdf 31). The ad hoc “Groundwater Modeling Workgroup” provided input to the Forest Service, which concluded that “the presence of a subsidence lake was speculative and not reasonably foreseeable, and as such it would therefore be inappropriate to analyze in the EIS” (DEIS, p. 376). The types of participants in the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup is described in the DEIS (p. 296), but their qualifications are not. The potential to form a subsidence lake in the crater is rejected in the DEIS but is discussed in detail in Prucha’s Review of Hydrologic Impacts of the DEIS (see Appendix). The DEIS concludes that “it is not possible to predict the details necessary to conduct even a rudimentary analysis of effects” (DEIS, p. 378) and does not make a prediction of the lake’s water quality. Prediction of the lake water quality is no more uncertain than all the other predictions made in the EIS and in some ways less complicated because all potential inputs and evaporation rates have already been estimated or can be estimated (see DEIS, Table 3.7.2-8). The range of potential concentrations in block cave groundwater could be used to estimate the range of concentrations in the subsidence lake and compared to water quality standards. The causes for the large discrepancy between block cave groundwater quality end members should also be better described in the DEIS. One possible cause is that Eary (2018f, p. 16) used the last three weeks of HCT results to estimate rates. Using results from the last weeks of testing will generally underestimate rates, assuming the tests were conducted for long enough to reach “steady state” conditions. Instead, a range of rates should be used, including maximum rates associated with maximum increase in iron and sulfate and maximum pH decreases (Maest and Nordstrom, 2017). Also, figures showing the HCT results are not presented in the DEIS or in any associated report that I could find. Examining the changes in concentrations in the tests visually is an important aid in understanding reactions occurring in the tests that will also occur in the field. 

The formation and quality of a subsidence lake should be re-evaluated in a revised DEIS, including the cumulative effects section because of the potential to pull water from the Magma Mine workings into the block cave zone, as described in Prucha’s Review of Hydrologic Impacts of the DEIS (see Appendix). The potential impact to birds and groundwater-dependent ecosystems should also be evaluated.

Runoff water quality for NPAG tailings is predicted to exceed standards for copper, nickel, selenium, and pH (also low) by smaller factors, but still by more than 500 times, indicating that; The DEIS states that stormwater contacting tailings would not be released or discharged to the environment at any time (p. 381). This belief is based on stormwater controls used for the tailings impoundments as part of the project. Even with reasonable mitigation measures, unexpected releases of stormwater can and will occur due to failures in design or construction of the mitigation measures, human error, storm events, and other causes. Climate change is causing more extreme storm events, and the design and operation of mine facilities must take this into account. Table 3 describes stormwater releases from large copper mines in Arizona, when they occurred, their effects, and the causes, when known. The report (Gestring, 2019) also includes releases of mine contaminants and tailings from dam failures, process facilities and other sources that are not included in Table 3. The mine contaminants associated with the releases in Table 3 included acidity, tailings, and metals such as copper and zinc. The stormwater releases adversely affected streams, soils, and groundwater and were caused by operator error, mechanical failures, and storm events.

"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," The conclusions of Maest’s report can be summarized as follows:   The tailings are proposed to be separated into potentially acid-generating (PAG) and non-PAG (NPAG) components as part of the mine plan. Two flotation fractions would be produced: pyrite or cleaner tailings, which have been designated as PAG, and the scavenger tailings, designated as NPAG, from which pyrite has been removed. However, according to the geochemical testing results, over half the “NPAG” tailings are PAG and will likely generate acid mine drainage. The contradiction is not explained in the DEIS. This finding indicates that well over half the tailings are likely to generate acid. "
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," The conclusions of Maest’s report can be summarized as follows:   The PAG and “NPAG” tailings are proposed to be managed differently in the same impoundment. The pyrite/PAG tailings (16% of total) would be submerged under water to minimize or prevent the generation of acid. But the scavenger/“NPAG” tailings (84% of total) would not be submerged. The finding above indicates that and a much larger percentage of the total tailings, upwards of 60%, would need to be managed as PAG and submerged under water. No plans exist in the DEIS for this eventuality that has already been confirmed by the geochemical testing. Currently, the mine plan calls for a 42-inch pipe for NPAG and a 2-inch pipe for PAG tailings (DEIS, p. 38). Managing substantially more PAG tailings will also require a larger PAG pipeline and more extraction of fresh water, neither of which has been included as a contingency in the DEIS. Because more water would be needed to keep the larger volume of PAG tailings submerged, less “excess” or recycled water would be able to be returned to the mine for makeup water, resulting in the need to extract more fresh water, which consists of dewatering water, CAP water, and well field water along the MARRCO corridor (see DEIS, p. ES-6). "

The number of pore volumes of water flushed through the column tests was estimated to represent thousands of years of waters moving through the block cave area after mining ceases. The test results show that samples that were already acidic remained acidic even when submerged under low-oxygen conditions. All tests showed a flush of copper and sulfate, regardless of whether they were acidic, during the first week of testing, indicating that copper-sulfate salts were dissolving rapidly. The results show that once the block cave area is inundated with rising groundwater, a flush of acid, copper, and sulfate will occur because of the dissolution of acidic metal-sulfate secondary salts. This flush of contaminants would contaminate groundwater in the block cave zone and could also affect groundwater-dependent ecosystems and the subsidence lake that would likely form above the collapsed ground surface.

The model predicting good water quality assumes that chemical weathering of wall rock and mineralized fractured rock in the block cave area will not supply any chemical load to the sump water. However, the results from the saturated column tests show that acidity, copper, and sulfate will be released in a flush when water levels rebound after mining. This water would heavily influence water quality in a subsidence crater lake, yet the DEIS assumes it will not form and that water quality of the lake could not be predicted.

Because the DEIS fails to address the great majority of those scoping comments and questions , these comments on the DEIS formally incorporate by reference the multiple pages of the scoping comments presented by the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition, San Carlos Apache Tribe and the Inter Tribal Association of Arizona. These comments list and summarize a few areas of concern, but USFS is respectfully advised to review and attend to the full original scoping comments . Please note that those scoping comments were presented so as to not require or encourage USFS disclosure of sensitive information. We are at a loss to explain why the DEIS fails to acknowledge and address our prior questions and concerns. "
"3.12.03","Cultural Resources: Archaeological Sites","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","the DEIS fails to disclose the basic descriptive information about cultural resources necessary to allow the public to understand and assist in assessing cultural resource impacts . The DEIS acknowledges that hundreds of archaeological, historical, and cultural sites will be damaged or destroyed by the proposed action. The amount of proposed damage and destruction is startling: although the DEIS affirms that cultural resource inventories are still adding to these tallies, 721 archaeological sites and three historical structures have been recorded within the direct impacts analysis area, of which 523 are recommended or determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The DEIS also notes that 568 sites are located in the indirect impacts analysis area, and that at least 265 of these are listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register. The DEIS goes on to quantify the project’s effects on cultural resources depending on Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) alternative. Alternative 6 would impact at least 193 more sites than Alternatives 2, 3, 4, or 5. 
The DEIS tells the public almost nothing about cultural resources impacts beyond these simple numbers. Section 3.12.3.2 is where the full description of the identified cultural resources should occur, but that necessary discussion does not occur in 3.12.3.2 or elsewhere in the DEIS. Instead, 3.12.3.2 provides only a simplistic “boilerplate” cultural history overview of the Superior region and a few references to common archaeological site types. Most of the remainder of Chapter 3.12 returns to numerical abstractions: counts of cultural resource sites that would be affected under various scenarios and alternatives. Little is provided about the sites themselves. For example, Section 3.12.4.3 says that “Under Alternative 2, 132 cultural resources would be impacted: 101 NRHP-eligible and 31 undetermined archaeological sites” (NRHP is the National Register of Historic Places). A reader wanting to know anything about these 132 resources—about how or when or how much they may be impacted by the proposed action—has no further information available: no tabular summary, no graphics, no data appendices, no review of the various values and meanings behind the numbers. Cultural resources are discussed almost entirely in quantitative terms, as items noted on a checklist rather than places of special spiritual, educational, scientific, historical, and cultural value that merit and require, pursuant to NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), individual and specific recognition, description, assessment, and analysis. 
In the DEIS failure to describe and analyze cultural resources and impacts except quantitatively, the DEIS fails to provide the public with even basic means by which to understand the nature, extent, values, and distributions of the project area’s cultural resources. Without such contextual and resource-specific information, there is little basis for evaluating their significance, their integrity, or how their impacts and losses might be minimized or mitigated. The DEIS neglects its mandate to disclose and assess cultural resource impacts because it fails to provide information about each identified cultural resource, the values it contains, the extent to which it will be impacted—directly, indirectly, or cumulatively; wholly or partially—and the types of impact avoidance or mitigation treatments available to be applied. It is understood that USFS must and should withhold sensitive information from public documents, but this should not be used as an excuse to avoid disclosing the nature, values, and generalized locations of the cultural resources that would be impacted and lost as a result of the proposed action. Nothing in law or policy prevents USFS from offering such discussions. Indeed, NEPA requires it. 
These comments incorporate the November 4, 2019 letter from the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition to the Tonto National Forest Supervisor identifying the specific, NHPA-based requirements for public involvement that must be met for Federal undertakings, like the action proposed in the DEIS, when NEPA is used in lieu of NHPA to solicit and manage public involvement in the NHPA Section 106 process.

Here, too, the DEIS fails to address essential questions: Did all project supervisory personnel and field directors meet or exceed Secretary of the Interior’s standards for education and experience required to perform archaeological identification, evaluation, registration, and treatment activities? Was there a written project manual or other source of guidance provided for field personnel in order to ensure consistent techniques, sound judgments, and accurate results? In what manner were sites evaluated to contain, not contain, or have the potential to contain buried cultural materials, especially human graves? Were field personnel trained and tested on their ability to recognize the subtle but unique attributes of Apache and Yavapai sites? How, specifically, were Tribal Monitors used in identification, evaluation, registration, and treatment planning efforts?

What if any criteria other than National Register Criterion D was used to evaluate cultural resource sites that pre-date Euro-American occupation of the project area? What factors distinguish “eligible” archaeological sites and other cultural resource sites from those of “indeterminate” eligibility requiring further investigations, such as archaeological testing?

Arizona "
"3.12.03","Cultural Resources: Archaeological Sites","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","The DEIS fails to adequately address cultural resource issues because the (NHPA) Section 106 compliance process remains substantially incomplete.

 USFS has neither comported with nor satisfied the pertinent regulatory standard for consultation: “the process of seeking, discussing, and considering the views of other participants, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them regarding matters arising in the section 106 process” (36 CFR 800.16(f)). USFS has not satisfied this regulatory definition for consultation and has unnecessarily confounded the Section 106 process for the proposed mine and land exchange by excluding tribes from communications with the Arizona State Historic Preservation Officer and other signatory parties and vice versa. This unauthorized exclusion has created confusion and suspicion on the part of tribes, and other parties. Despite various requests from tribes, clear recommendations and suggestions in the project scoping comments submitted by the San Carlos Apache Tribe on July 18, 2016, and admonishment from the Arizona SHPO (September 19, 2019 letter to Tonto supervisor, attached as CR-EX-01 (Appendix R ), USFS has failed to consult with all consulting parties regarding key steps in the Section 106 process to comply with NHPA. The parties have not been consulted on the area of potential effects, which USFS has done effectively unilaterally and in ways not always sensitive to historical and environmental contexts. USFS has failed to perform the public and government-to-government tribal consultations essential to the Section 106 steps and determinations, especially the consultations required (1) per 36 CFR 800.4(b) to make a “reasonable and good faith effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts” to find and document historic properties; (2) per 36 CFR 800.4(c) to evaluate the significance and determine the eligibility of identified historic properties; (3) per 36 CFR 800.5 to assess the adverse effects of the proposed mine and land exchange on historic properties; and (4) per 36 CFR 800.6 to resolve adverse effects, which USFS is attempting to do, despite requests not to, via the execution of a premature and flawed PA (see comments that follow here; see also CR-EX-01, 02, 03 (Appendix R ) , and the November 4, 2019 letter from the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition to the Tonto National Forest Supervisor identifying the specific, NHPA-based requirements for public involvement).

"APPO","Appendix O- Draft NHPA Compliance Agreement","APP","Appendices"," The DEIS includes a flawed and outdated Programmatic Agreement (PA) prepared to enable USFS compliance with NHPA. The DEIS inclusion as Appendix O of an inferior and superseded version (5) of the PA indicates USFS failure to coordinate NHPA compliance with NEPA compliance. Version 6 of the PA has been available since before DEIS release. Both Version 5 and Version 6 remain unacceptable because they are dependent and contingent on the completion of step-by-step NHPA Section 106 consultations with tribes and other parties that have not occurred, as discussed above and in the July 10, 2019 and September 30, 2019 letters to USFS from the San Carlos Apache Tribe (attached as CR-EX-02 and CR-EX-03 , respectively (Appendix R )). The failure to prepare, and to release in the DEIS, a full and adequate PA disables and discounts essential public, technical, and tribal participation in the NHPA and NEPA processes. It also contributes bias and confusion to those compliance processes by conveying false and misleading impressions of coordination and adequacy of stakeholder consultations and other essential procedures. In fact, two of the required signatories of the PA, the Arizona SHPO and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation are expressing concerns about Version 6 of the PA. PA execution is not likely until December 2019 at the earliest. "
"3.12.06","Cultural Resources: Mitigation","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","The DEIS fails to include avoidance and mitigation plans for cultural resources. According to Section 3.12.4.9 (DEIS p. 638), impacts to cultural resources will be addressed through a “robust mitigation plan” that “would be contained in the FEIS, required by the ROD, and ultimately included in the GPO approved by the Forest Service. Public comment on the EIS, and in particular Appendix J, will inform the final suite of mitigations.” The DEIS further states that “Adverse impacts on resources that may not be historic properties under Section 106 would be avoided, minimized, or mitigated through steps outlined in the FEIS and ROD” (DEIS p. 661). These DEIS assertions amount to admissions that tribes, the public, and concerned technical experts will not have the opportunity to understand and analyze the cultural resource mitigation plans until the FEIS is released. Instead of following customary practice in NEPA and NHPA compliance, and instead of following the detailed recommendations in the 2015 Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Study (see CR-EX-05 (Appendix R )) USFS has delayed and deferred essential consultations and planning processes. USFS has known for at least 15 years that the Oak Flat area contains exceptionally rich and diverse cultural resources and that many of these resources hold great significance to tribes and to tribal members and citizens (US Department of Agriculture Tonto National Forest, 2015). USFS could and should have prioritized consultations with tribes, peer experts in cultural resources, and other parties to enable prompt, respectful, and culturally and scientifically appropriate and credible actions to give due consideration to cultural resources as part of mining project planning and design. DEIS Appendix J could and should have included detailed plans, specifications, and standards for avoiding and mitigating both historic properties and other cultural resources. Yet, for reasons not disclosed in the DEIS, Appendix J provides only two measures for addressing “Cultural/Historical Resources and Tribal Values” (p. J-22): historic property treatment plans (HPTPs). Neither of the HPTPs are available for public or professional-technical review; both appear to promise the exact same treatment for two different sets of cultural resources, namely additional damage through excavation and the restrictive and potentially unnecessary treatment of cultural resources almost exclusively as archaeological sites. The fact that the DEIS exclusively references historic property treatment plans indicates USFS failure to assess impacts upon and create mitigation options for cultural resources other than historic properties (see CR-EX-04 (Appendix R for Zuni Tribe affirmation of similar concerns). The DEIS fails to disclose the reasons for these otherwise apparently needless delays in essential planning and consultation processes and fails to provide and analyze basic information concerning the nature, distribution, and significance of cultural resources. In these ways the DEIS fails to enable or guide public, tribal, and technical comments about cultural resource impact mitigation. In effect, the DEIS requires the public, technical experts, and the affected tribes to wait until the FEIS to learn how significant impacts to cultural resources will be addressed, if at all. This is unacceptable as well as inconsistent with multiple laws and policies, as discussed in the more detailed cultural resource comments below. "
"3.12.01","Cultural Resources: Cultural History","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","The DEIS fails to sufficiently document or analyze cultural resources and significant impacts to cultural resources important in Hispanic and Anglo history and culture, especially the histories and cultures of industrial mining and livestock raising. The failure of the DEIS to include a complete, useful, and up-to-date programmatic agreement is symptomatic of and is exacerbated by incomplete and selective public engagement in the identification of historic properties and other cultural resources threatened by the proposed mine and land exchange. The almost exclusive DEIS focus on Native American cultural resources is antithetical to public involvement and recommended NHPA-NEPA practice. This flaw further indicates incomplete NEPA–NHPA coordination and incomplete and flawed cultural resource identification and assessment. The DEIS offers no evidence or record of non-tribal public involvement or consultations regarding non-tribal cultural resources. Perhaps because of the failure to learn from local historians and community representatives, the DEIS arbitrarily ignores cultural resources important in Hispanic, Anglo, and industrial mining and livestock raising histories and cultures. Examples of these resources include residential and commercial buildings and historic structures and features in and around Superior. Both the DEIS and the Programmatic Agreement for Compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act on the Resolution Copper Project (DEIS Appendix O, “PA”) fail to consider adequately the historic built environment, and the DEIS (3.12.4, p. 629) mentions only “several houses and a hotel”. Additionally, the DEIS also ignores trails as cultural resources, including the Stoneman Grade. The DEIS further ignores an extensive stone fence system and a likely pre-20th century trail in the middle reaches of Gaan Canyon (apparently not recorded during cultural resource surveys). Nothing in Federal law allows or enables USFS to discount or disregard either cultural resources or cultural resource values or issues important in non-Native American culture and history. "
"3.12.01","Cultural Resources: Cultural History","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","    The DEIS fails to describe and provide a useful historical framework for documenting and assessing the human environment, as needed to analyze likely and potential impacts and to devise impact mitigations. The DEIS failure to document and analyze the non-Native portion of the cultural resource spectrum makes sense in light of the overall DEIS failure to describe, disclose, and apply the “historic contexts” and research questions essential to the correct, consistent, and meaningful identification, evaluation, registration, and mitigation of cultural resources across the vast and complex area being prepared to host the proposed mine. The DEIS notes (3.12.3.2, p. 625) that, “summaries of the cultural history of the area can be found in many reference reports (see, for example, Lindeman and Whitney (2005) and Buckles (2009)” [there may be citation errors here, see Lindeman and Whitney (2003), Buckles (2008)]. This is a flawed and distracting attempt to incorporate by reference two technical reports, neither of which are publicly available because both contain restricted information on cultural resource site locations. More to the point, both of the reports cited in the DEIS are more than a decade old and are based on information, research designs, and historic contexts that could and should have been updated by the intervening decade of cultural resource investigations. The DEIS fails to provide or to incorporate by reference detailed, up-to-date, context-specific description of the affected human environment in general and cultural resource in particular. The culture history simplistically summarized in DEIS section 3.12.3.2 is only one part or dimension of understanding the development and valuation of the affected environment. In this sense, the DEIS fails to address essential questions: Were historic contexts developed during the Class I survey (in advance of the archaeological field studies) to help interpret and evaluate sites as they were encountered in the field? Did such historic contexts incorporate the idea of “whole landscape,” or full-spectrum, archaeology, where the entire landscape serves as the analytical unit rather than spatially-segregated, bounded or point-plotted subunits of the landscape? Did the thematic or historic context statements and research design questions address the potential importance of Oak Flat as a crossroads for travel, trade, communication, and integrative social and ceremonial activities? Did the thematic or historic context statements and research design questions address the potential importance of the region as a case study in the “ethnic cleansing” of Yavapai and Apache families by U.S. Army troops and vigilantes to open the area for mining? In its failures to address these questions the DEIS disables and hampers not only USFS mandates to assess and disclose impacts but the essential public and technical reviews and inputs required pursuant to NEPA and related authorities. Instead of doing as tribes and colleagues have asked, and instead of carefully and respectfully describing the social environment to be impacted by the proposed mining activities, this DEIS gives the public and tribes only a facile abstract of regional cultural history (see 3.12.3.2), a 2-page summary that silences the lives of dozens of generations of people who lived upon, thrived, and benefitted from the project area. Where, in the DEIS or NHPA documentation, is the context-sensitive assessment and analysis of cultural resources and their manifest and manifold contributions to the human environment? Where, in the DEIS or other documentation and analysis of the current human environment, is the identification of the most consequential factors and dynamics that have shaped the region slated for impacts from the proposed mine? Where, in particular, are the historic context statements required to add dimension to the recitation of tallies of various types and numbers of cultural resource categories? The DEIS fails to disclose and assess elements of the human environment subject to irrevocable alteration, even erasure, by the proposed mine. USFS is obligated to document, develop, and employ historic contexts that might include the following contexts, and / or other themes or contexts for understanding the affected area: Cultural overlaps —how, when, where, under what conditions and for what reasons did different groups of Native Americans and newcomer Euro-Americans occupy, use, share, and resist use and sharing of the area proposed for alteration by mining activities? Movement —For what reasons, by what means, and through use of what general routes did people travel to and through the impact area? Spiritual and religious significance —Who, when, where, and with what results have so many different people found spiritual inspiration and offered devotion in and through the area proposed for alteration by mining activities? Native American displacement —What compelled the United States to support and enable the interests and demands of non-Arizonans to the detriment of Native Arizonans in a manner that would today be recognized, internationally, as a crime against humanity? Why has this tragic episode, though well documented in authoritative works by respected scholars (especially Kuhn, 2014 and Welch, 2017; see CR-EX-07 (Appendix R )), been ignored, apparently deliberately, in the DEIS and historic context statements? Mining and grazing — What geological, technological, and local and global political and historical developments and dynamics led to regional domination by the mining and livestock industries? 	 "
"3.12.01","Cultural Resources: Cultural History","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","The DEIS fails to describe and assess the cultural, spiritual, communal, educational, and other non-scientific/archaeological values of cultural resource; this failure ignores and discounts manifest connections among cultural resources and the people and communities who rely upon these resources for identity, vitality, connectivity, strength, and health. 
Cultural resource issues and concerns are explicitly recognized in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and numerous other laws and policies. Section 3003(c)(3)(A), requires USFS to “engage government-to-government consultation with affected Indian Tribes concerning issues of concern.” Further, Section 3003(c)(3)(B) requires USFS to then 
“consult with Resolution Copper and seek to find mutually acceptable measures to address the concerns of the affected Indian tribes; and minimize adverse effects on the affected Indian tribes resulting from mining and related activities.” 
Section (c)(9)(C) specifically requires the DEIS to “(i.) assess the effects of the mining and related activities on the Federal land conveyed to Resolution Copper under this section on the cultural and archeological resources that may be located on the Federal land; and (ii.) identify measures that may be taken, to the extent practicable, to minimize potential adverse impacts on those resources, if any.” 
Our scoping comments and other documents demonstrate that USFS could and should have incorporated abundant information and guidance regarding cultural resources, cultural resource values, and culturally appropriate methods for evaluating the significance of cultural resources to minimize adverse impacts on cultural and archaeological resources and the values embedded therein (see, for example CR-EX-02, 03, 04 (Appendix R )). Tribes cooperated extensively with the Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Study of the Superior Area, Arizona (Hopkins et al. 2015, see an executive summary of the study, attached here as CR-EX-05 (Appendix R )). From 2013 to 2015, 94 duly designated representatives from 10 tribes helped compile new and existing information on traditional and historical occupation and use of the impact area. The study identified over 400 historic properties considered eligible for the National Register because of their importance in tribal culture and religion—ancestral living, gathering, and hunting areas, trails, petroglyphs, landforms, water sources, and places of religious and spiritual importance and observance. The report also identified and outlined the significance of 46 springs and numerous plants, minerals, and animals in the impact area. The 94 tribal representatives agreed that the proposed mine constitutes a disrespectful, consumptive, extractive, harmful, and irrevocable commitment of cultural resources and public lands that tribal communities rely upon for health, well-being, and spiritual and cultural orientation and vitality. The 2015 report recommended USFS steps to further assess resource significances and to plan ways to minimize those adverse impacts. 
Recommendations from the 2015 Study were incorporated into the San Carlos Apache July 18, 2016 scoping comments: “Meaningful and sustained consultation and collaborative research into all of the values associated with all of the cultural resources is required to achieve even basic compliance with applicable law and policy.” The 2015 study report, the 2016 scoping comments, and many subsequent communications to USFS have affirmed mandates for USFS to assure that the full range of mitigative measures and alternatives are considered to avoid and reduce impacts to cultural resources and attendant harms to tribes and their members and citizens. 
Instead of providing what the tribes have requested and continue to request, what the public needs and deserves to participate in the NEPA and NHPA processes, and what the Ethnohistoric Study (Hopkins et al. 2015) authoritatively recommends, the DEIS and PA discount and almost ignore those values through a single-minded focus on excavation as mitigation. No meaningful analysis has been directed to spiritual, familial, communal, educational, ecological, and associative values embedded in cultural resources. No useful, creative, or incisive treatments are being prescribed to avoid or reduce the numerous and profound harms and impacts to cultural resources and the communities of people who care about them. In sum, despite many explicit legal and professional requirements to do otherwise, and the many available sources of information and guidance on how, when, and with whom to work, the DEIS ignores and discounts the non-archaeological values of the cultural resources. 
"
"3.14.01","Tribal Values and Concerns: Ethnographic Study","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns"," The DEIS fails—in the sections on Public Health and Safety (3.10), on Cultural Resources (3.12), on Tribal Values (3.14), and elsewhere—to provide a meaningful assessment of the direct, indirect, and cumulative harms of the proposed action on tribes in general and the descendants of the Yavapai and Pinal and Aravaipa Apaches in particular. 
Chapter 3 outlines various adverse impacts to many values and resources without giving meaningful attention to the living people and communities that have already begun to experience significant impacts from the proposed action and will suffer for many generations. Instead of following the many mandates for government-to-government consultations and the recommendations of the 2015 Ethnohistoric Study, the DEIS incorporates an untested use of Tribal Monitors as unauthorized tribal surrogates to represent tribal interests and preferences in relation to the identification and analysis of Tribal Values. Despite sustained expressions of concern by tribal government officials (see CR-EX-02, 03, 04 (Appendix R )), USFS has uncritically adopted methods for historic property identification commonly used to obtain compliance with NHPA Section 106. This USFS adoption simply replaces archaeologists with Tribal Monitors and unilaterally imposes that approach in an attempt to address Tribal Values. Stubborn USFS insistence on the use of Tribal Monitors confines Tribal Values to material things and ignores and discounts the impacts of the proposed action and all action alternatives on spiritual and communal health and other Tribal Values. 
USFS is well aware of the harmful impacts of industrial land alteration and mining on tribes and their members. In a special assertion of tribal solidarity, and as the outcome from a collective visit to Oak Flat, on June 20, 2007, the duly elected executives of the Camp Verde Yavapai Apache, Hopi, Hualapai, San Carlos Apache, Tonto Apache, and White Mountain Apache tribes formed a Tribal Coalition to inform President Bush: 
“The Tribal Coalition cannot, on any basis, support a legislative land exchange which would allow for the destruction of these culturally significant and environmentally important lands, especially where the devastating impacts to be conducted on, around, and underneath Oak Flat and Apache Leap will continue forever, leaving future generations to suffer from the legacy…. These impacts, coupled with the cumulative environmental effects of other significant mining activities in the region, must not be lightly cast aside….” ( CR-EX-06 (Appendix R )) 
More recently, in response to USFS attempts to ignore and discount the damages to the individual and communal health of Apaches from the proposed action and all action alternatives, on July 10, 2019, San Carlos Apache Tribe Chairman Rambler wrote to USFS to confirm that “Real, substantial, and enduring harms are being perpetrated on the Tribe's lands and peoples, myself included, in the name of profit. It behooves TNF, as the agency that acts on behalf of our federal trustee, the United States, to confront this truth head-on, to explicitly and frankly assess the damages being done to Apache health and welfare, and to assure that other parties appreciate and understand this truth to the extent that they are able to do so” ( CR-EX-02 (Appendix O )). 
USFS is obligated, as a federal agency and tribal trustee, to disclose to the American People the clear and consistent warnings from tribes that great spiritual and material / health harms are imminent. Industrial mining in general, and especially industrial mining of sacred sites within tribal homelands, and most particularly industrial mining made possible by genocide directed at Native Americans by the forebears of the proponents of the proposed action, is not a good idea, and certainly not in the public interest. Regardless of the agency’s mistaken view of its regulatory authority over the proposed uses of the remaining federal lands discussed above, it is unmistakably true, however, that USFS has affirmative duties—per NEPA, NHPA, Section 3003 of the 2015 NDAA, Executive Order 13175, and other authorities—to identify, disclose, analyze, and mitigate the impacts that the proposed action and action alternatives portend. If both the lack of USFS discretion and the USFS legal mandates to identify, disclose, etc. are true, then what, precisely, is preventing USFS from acknowledging the historical truth of the Pinal Apache Genocide and assessing the indirect, direct, and cumulative impacts that the history of industrial mining have had and are having on Apache people and land (and on other Native peoples and lands)? Who and what is the Federal Government, the designated trustee for the tribes and their members and citizens, assuring benefits for by refusing to explain to tribes and the public how it came to pass that, in 1870, the Pinal Mountains were Native American land and resources, and how, a short 150 years later, a massive share of these lands and resources are being given to an international corporation with no meaningful recognition, and certainly no compensation, to the aboriginal owners? If, as USFS claims, there can be no denying of or substantial change to the proposed action (or action alternatives), then why does the DEIS fail to provide even a simple acknowledgement of the tragedy that unfolded in and around the mine’s impact area in the 1800s? What is preventing USFS from following pertinent Federal statutes and regulations by disclosing this chapter in human and environmental history? Why do the USFS and DEIS fail, at bare minimum, to eliminate obstacles to potentially healthful truth and reconciliation processes by acknowledging what happened? It is legally and morally incorrect for the DEIS to fail acknowledge the Pinal Apache Genocide. It is legally and morally incorrect for the DEIS to fail to analyze relationships among the nineteenth century extirpation of the Pinal Apaches, current and foreseeable health and welfare of tribal and non-tribal communities, and the likely consequences of another massive mine that has been given initial Federal Government approval to desecrate and destroy a place cherished and held sacred by multiple tribes across dozens of generations. Law and humanity oblige reasonable disclosure, reasoned analysis, and respectful consultation on how to stop ongoing harms and reduce impacts.

"3.14.01","Tribal Values and Concerns: Ethnographic Study","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns"," The DEIS fails to properly identify or analyze an alternative that avoids or meaningfully reduces adverse effects and significant impacts to cultural resources. Despite multiple requests, including clear appeals in the San Carlos Apache Tribe scoping comments (July 18, 2016) for early and continuous attention to the avoidance of cultural resource impacts, all of the action alternatives include substantial and irrevocable destruction of more than 100 cultural resource localities. All action alternatives include direct and permanent damage to the NRHP-listed Chí’chil Biłdagoteel Historic District. None of the alternatives analyze the impacts to the health and welfare of those who value, care about, care for, and derive their identity and health from the affected cultural resources. "
"CHAP2","Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives","CH2","Chapter 2","The preferred alternative includes the greatest and most significant and harmful impacts to cultural resources and, thereby, to the people who value, care about, care for, and derive their identity and health from the affected cultural resources.  Chapter 2 of the DEIS claims that “impacts of mine development at the associated project facilities would have equivalent adverse effects on cultural resources” (p. 121). In clear and direct contradiction to this claim, the DEIS elsewhere confirms significant variation in culture resource site impacts across the action alternatives: “Alternatives 2 and 3 (101 sites); Alternative 4 (122 sites); Alternative 5 (114–125 sites, depending on pipeline route); and Alternative 6 (318–343 sites, depending on pipeline route)” (ES-3.12, p. ES-26; see also p. 121). In other words, despite the duplicitous DEIS claim that all action alternatives will have equivalent cultural resource impacts, the preferred alternative would impact roughly the same number of cultural resource sites as the other three alternatives combined. While many of the same cultural resource sites would be impacted under all action alternatives, the three essential points are (1) that USFS has selected the TSF alternative located the closest to tribal trust lands (San Carlos Apache Tribe lands) and the one with by far the greatest number of site impacts; (2) impacts to cultural resource sites are impacts to the people who value, care about, care for, and derive their identity and health from the affected cultural resources; and (3) the DEIS fails to adequately or meaningfully analyze this variation in site impacts and, by extension impacts to people and communities. In this area of consideration and elsewhere, the DEIS is premature and incomplete in its disclosures and analyses. The agency-preferred Skunk Camp TSF (Alternative 6) alternative was not consistently or thoroughly included in planning or analysis prior to about June 2017. Proper disclosure would have enabled earlier, better and more complete analyses of cultural resource impacts. Because the information is incomplete and the analysis remains in progress, the DEIS fails the essential test of providing a reasoned and evidence-based rationale for the selection of Skunk Camp as the preferred TSF alternative. The DEIS release in advance of opportunities for public and tribal involvement in the comparative analysis of TSF alternatives has eliminated and foreclosed public participation in the hurried and incompletely disclosed identification of Alternative 6 as the preferred TSF alternative. One reasonable conclusion is that that USFS identified the TSF preferred alternative on the basis of factors not fully disclosed in the DEIS.  	 "
"3.14.01","Tribal Values and Concerns: Ethnographic Study","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns","The DEIS fails to disclose and analyze the fact that the significant adverse effects to cultural resources are disproportionately focused on Native American people and tribes. Only about 189 of the 721 identified archaeological sites have Euro-American components or affinities (DEIS p. 628). The rest of the archaeological sites and all of the hundreds of non-archaeological cultural resources have primary affinities with and are primarily valued by Native Americans. As detailed above in our comments and exhibits (see, especially, CR-EX-05 (Appendix R )), even in the face of an unbroken history of disrespectful and destructive Federal Government and mining industry actions to destroy Native American cultures and cultural resources, tribes have again stepped forward to provide generous guidance and assistance to USFS (see, especially, Hopkins et al., 2015, CR-EX-04 (Appendix R )) . The USFS response in the DEIS is to ignore and discount tribal input and requests. The ongoing harms of previous mining projects across central Arizona are amply reflected in the health and welfare of the tribal people and communities most concerned about the proposed Resolution Mine and about the biophysical and cultural resources imperiled by the proposal.

Will the historic structures and character of old downtown Superior be affected by physical, visual, and socioeconomic impacts attributable to the proposed action? What impacts may occur to historic properties outside of the project area when Oak Flat and other nearby scenic and recreational areas are closed to the public, and recreational activities (including off-road driving, camping, target shooting, etc.) are diverted onto other lands and concentrated into smaller areas?

"3.15.01","Environmental Justice: General","3.15","Section 3.15 - Environmental Justice","DEIS Section 3.15.4.3 identifies multiple potential and likely impacts on environmental justice communities (EJCs) but subsequently restricts assessment in the DEIS to two narrow and superficial areas: (1) “Quantitative assessment of economic effects
“and qualitative assessment of whether these effects are disproportionate” and (2) “Qualitative assessment of disproportionate effects of adverse resource impacts.” These comments on the DEIS acknowledge and incorporate by reference those comments of October 25, 2019, relating to failure of the DEIS to address EJCs submitted by Professor Steven Boyd (EJ-EX-01). The USFS is required to disclose, analyze, and mitigate significant impacts on EJCs pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 12898 (59 FR 7629 February 16, 1994, which addresses environmental justice in minority populations), NEPA, and related laws and policies. Moreover, EO 12898 supplements EO No. 12250 (45 FR 72995, November 2, 1980), Sec. 1-201(a) and (d), quoted in pertinent part in the comments submitted by Professor Boyd. Taken together, EO 12898 and 12250 mandate that projects such as RCM must address environmental justice among minority populations, such as American Indians. The DEIS (p. 124) identifies a group of economic and environmental effects likely to have disproportionate effects on EJCs: 
“the expected influx of new workers may also lead to shortages of area housing and/or pressures on municipal infrastructure such as roads, schools, and medical facilities, and may be accompanied by price increases. Such changes would be most likely to adversely affect low-income and minority individuals in the town of Superior and other environmental justice communities in the region.”
“increased traffic, noise, increased potential exposure to hazardous material spills or releases, as well as loss of certain recreational opportunities and changes to area scenic resources, are anticipated to occur, but would affect everyone equally and would therefore not be disproportionate.”

The DEIS then identifies 29 EJCs within Pinal, Gila, Maricopa, and Graham counties, and an additional group of EJCs located within the lands of eight Native American tribes. The methods employed to define EJCs rely on county boundaries and thereby result in arbitrary and harmful (to tribes) exclusions of likely EJCs located immediately adjacent to EJCs recognized in the DEIS. For example, the White Mountain Apache Tribe communities of Fort Apache, East Fork, and Whiteriver, all excluded from analysis because they are located in Navajo County, are located within about four miles of Canyon Day, an EJC located in Gila County (DEIS p. 675). The DEIS fails to provide for the tribal EJCs poverty status data that would enable comparisons with the 29 non-tribal EJCs. The DEIS identifies only eight sets of tribal communities and five of the 29 non-tribal EJCs (Superior, Globe, Hayden, Miami, and Winkleman) as having the potential to be disproportionately impacted by the proposed action. The DEIS fails to provide adequate description or justification for the exclusion of the great majority of the EJCs from further analysis.

"3.15.01","Environmental Justice: General","3.15","Section 3.15 - Environmental Justice"," The DEIS fails, despite requirements in NEPA, E.O. 12898, and related law and policy, to adequately describe and meaningfully assess the impacts (that is, their magnitude, frequency, and intensity on direct, indirect, and cumulative levels) on EJCs, especially tribes and communities of Native American religious practitioners. The DEIS fails to assess the actual, in-progress impacts from the proposed action to the human environment associated with these eight tribes, including the disruptions and anxieties associated with the senses of duty and obligation to respond to and resist the newest in the long sequence of threats to tribal lands, people, cultures, and religions. Many tribes and individuals have been obliged by the proposed action to re-allocate funds, personal time, prayers, and tribal staff to investigate the proposed action, to attempt to educate USFS, and to find ways to stop or reduce the adverse effects of the proposed action. In its failure to acknowledge, describe, and assess the significant impacts that the proposed action is already having on the tribal EJCs, and perhaps other EJCs, the USFS and DEIS indicate indifference to the obvious, enduring, cumulative impacts and harms to tribes, their members, their treasuries, their heartfelt obligations to care for their ancestral lands and places, etc. The DEIS discounts and effectively ignores the great costs incurred by EJCs obliged to respond to the manifold threats of the proposed action instead of to other matters. The DEIS fails, too, to meaningfully and adequately address, describe, and assess and reasonably foreseeable impacts on those tribes, especially the San Carlos Apache Tribe and its communities of religious practitioners. The DEIS fails to do more than mention the direct, proximal, and possibly cumulative effects on communities of religious practitioners and fails to acknowledge or discuss the ongoing and escalating violation of these practitioners’ First Amendment rights to free practice of their religion. The DEIS fails to analyze the long history of Federal Government efforts to curb and inhibit the free exercise of the religion of the Apaches and other tribes. The DEIS fails to meaningfully describe and analyze the proposed and already in-progress desecration and destruction of known places of cultural and religious significance as the latest instance of federal trust betrayal, regardless of the lack of intent to do harm by USFS. In these ways and other ways the DEIS places arbitrary and needlessly restrictive limits on its descriptions and analyses of EJCs, as well as on Tribal Values, Public Health, Cultural Resources, etc. The DEIS ignores and fails to address the abundant evidence for still-unfolding damages and harms to Native American tribes, people, and communities of religious practitioners from previous Federal Government actions, including multiple comparable and reckless actions authorized by Tonto National Forest that have affected and are still affecting the same tribes being actively and harmfully affected by the current proposed action. In its efforts to assess impacts from the proposed action on EJCs, USFS could and should have asserted its trust responsibility for the welfare of tribes and trial members and identified and analyzed every reasonably foreseeable impact on tribal EJCs, including cumulative impacts. The DEIS could and should have followed the many useful and relevant recommendations provided in the 2015 Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Study of the Superior Region (Hopkins et al. 2015). The DEIS could and should have built upon the sturdy consultative foundations of that 2015 study to assess, document, and seek to identify mitigations for the significant impacts to EJCs. Instead, and as noted elsewhere in these comments, the DEIS neglects and ignores that 2015 study and the numerous suggestions and requests from tribes to address their concerns, their Tribal Values, and their cultural resources.

"3.15.01","Environmental Justice: General","3.15","Section 3.15 - Environmental Justice","The DEIS fails to adequately identify the spatial extent of the impacts from the proposed action on EJCs. The DEIS claims, “Because there are no communities located within the project area, there would not be disproportionately high or adverse direct impacts on environmental justice communities as a result of disturbance” (p. 679). With this unsupported assertion—and without either EJC-specific consultations, necessary and required analyses, or the evidence-based justification for this approach—the DEIS excludes descriptions and assessments of how the proposed action’s impacts on geology, soils, and wildlife may or will affect EJCs.

The May 17, 2018, memo to the Resolution EIS Project Files from BBC Research & Consulting (EJ-EX-02) offers glimpses of the changes underway, including changing demographics and demands for housing, public services, and new amenities—demands that are likely to result in significant changes having disproportionate effects on minority and low-income populations. What neither that memo nor the DEIS describe or analyze is the likely disproportionate effects on the low-income and Hispanic population of Superior. The DEIS fails to address the education and training issues that will hamper the capacity of EJCs, and especially the Superior EJC, from taking advantage of employment opportunities. The DEIS fails to address the income disparity issues, few if any of which will be alleviated by the proposed action, which limit EJC access to transportation and relocation options to escape the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the proposed action. The DEIS fails to address the likelihood that EJC contributions to the Superior tax base will fund new public services and amenities that the EJCs will not need, want, or be able to afford to access.

The DEIS attempt to exclude numerous issues and concerns relevant to the assessment of impacts from the proposed action on EJCs is not based in logic, not based in public or tribal consultations, and not based on any supporting evidence disclosed in the DEIS. The DEIS fails to include detailed descriptions and assessments of the EJCs and of the status, conditions, and trends associated with their economies, employment, housing, transportation, health, and use of the lands, waters, recreation amenities, plants, animals, cultural resources, and other resources to be affected by the proposed action.

Through this DEIS the USFS is demanding, in effect and without providing any useful or logical rationale for such a demand, that the public, the affected tribes, and most especially the members of the EJCs, simply and unconditionally trust that the final EIS and ROD will somehow address their needs and concerns in a time of great uncertainty, including existential anxiety for some individuals and groups. This is simply an outrageous and unconscionable demand by USFS, and one that reveals utter and apparently callous disregard for those least able to voice their concerns and respond to the DEIS and the proposed action.

The land exchange would have a disproportionately adverse effect on Native American communities as a result of the effects on tribal values and concerns and cultural resources.” The DEIS also recognizes that there will be, “Disturbance to and loss of access to sacred sites, traditional cultural properties, and traditional resources collecting areas within the proposed mining area” (Table 3.15.4-1, p. 682). The DEIS further recognizes that the proposed action, especially mining beneath Oak Flat, will “permanently affect the ability of tribal members to use known TCPs and TEKPs for cultural and religious purposes… an irreversible commitment of resources” (DEIS 3.17.2.33).

For years, the San Carlos Apache Tribe, Yavapai, other Tribal cultures in the region, as well as organizations, have repeatedly communicated the specific ways the RCPLE will impact the exercise of their religious beliefs and practices, the lack of TNF’s analysis the effects of the RCPLE on their free exercise of religion is both glaring and incomprehensible. While the US Congress passed the 2015 NDAA, § 3003 that provided for the RCPLE, the USFS and, in this case, TNF have the responsibility to uphold and expose violation of constitutional protections afforded all US citizens, especially those of federally recognized Tribes. This Environmental Justice (EJ) section will address areas in which the DEIS failed to do that. 
(Not covered by this section are the potentially countless yet unknown ways in which EJ issues concerning air, chemicals and toxics, health, land, waste, and cleanup, and water, among others, will impact the predominantly Hispanic or Latino populations within the towns of Superior, Hayden, and Miami, or places such as the town of Globe or the Dripping Springs community, where Hispanic or Latino populations are significant.

2. In the EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples (EPA PEJWFRTIP), July 24, 2014, The EPA defines “environmental justice” as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies . The EPA PEJWFRTIP is designed to better clarify and integrate environmental justice principles in a consistent manner in the Agency’s work with federally recognized tribes and indigenous peoples .

I. US Trust Responsibilities
Areas Requiring Additional TNF Analysis:
1. How, specifically, does the RCPLE violate:
a. Treaties with the affected tribes?
b. Federal statutes (e.g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) P.L. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488)
c. Executive Orders?
d. Court decisions concerning the trust responsibilities of the US?
e. The US Constitution?
The DEIS acknowledges the “Disturbance to and loss of access to sacred sites, traditional cultural properties, and traditional resources collecting areas within the proposed mining area” (Table 3.15.4-1). How does the RCPLE prohibit the “free exercise of religion” of the Apache, Yavapai, and other tribal peoples protected by the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) P.L. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488? The subsidence at Chi’Chil Bildagoteel/Oak Flat will cause “Changes that permanently affect the ability of tribal members to use known TCPs and TEKPs for cultural and religious purposes are also an irreversible commitment of resources” (DEIS 3.17.2.33). The inability of tribal members to access TCPs, especially Chi’Chil Bildagoteel/Oak Flat, presents a different set of circumstances than those underlying the claims in the Navajo Nation v. USFS, 506 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2008) or Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439 (1988). In those cases access to sites where Native ceremonies are performed were still available to the tribal plaintiffs. With the RCPLE, a primary site, Chi’Chil Bildagoteel/Oak Flat, will be made forever unavailable to the Apache, Yavapai, and others, thus preventing the exercise of their religious ceremonies altogether.

 The lack of TNF’s analysis or even mention of the impact of RCPLE on the religious practice of the San Carlos Apache, Yavapai, and other affected Native American groups raises the question as to whether TNF would not analyze or mention the effects of the RCPLE, if the site lay under the National Cathedral (Washington, DC), the Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim (Charleston, SC: Oldest Synagogue in continuous use in the United States), or the Mother Mosque of America (Cedar Rapids, IA).

Since EPA PEJWFRTIP, #3 requires TNF “to understand definitions of human health and the environment from the perspective of federally recognized tribes, indigenous peoples throughout the United States…” how, specifically, does the RCPLE affect the hundreds of cultural resources (including the land, water, plants and animals, inter alios) and associated values, including religious practices, identified in the expert testimony of Apache, Yavapai, Zuni, Hopi and others in the Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Study of the Superior Area ? 
2. The DEIS asserts that “Native American communities would be disproportionately affected by the land exchange because Oak Flat would be conveyed to private property and would no longer be subject to the NHPA (see section 3.12). Loss of the culturally important area of Oak Flat would be a substantial threat to the perpetuation of cultural traditions of the Apache and Yavapai tribes. The land exchange would have a disproportionately adverse effect on Native American communities as a result of the effects on tribal values and concerns and cultural resources.” In consultation with the Apache, Yavapai, and other affected tribes, the TNF must identify specific ways in which the RCPLE prohibits the “free exercise of religion,” of current and future practitioners, including for example, the impact in the affected area on: a. Sunrise ceremonies; b. The Holy Ground crosses and ceremonies; c. The connection between Apache Leap Chi’Chil Bildagoteel; d. Currently identified and yet to be identified burial sites; e. The Ga’an people as understood by the affected tribes; and f. The written history preserved by the petroglyphs in Devil’s Canyon, 
3. The DEIS reports the “potential for some portion of existing yet currently unidentified prehistoric and historic artifacts and resources to be disturbed or destroyed, especially within the Oak Flat subsidence area and the footprint of the tailings storage area. These losses could potentially include human burials within these areas” (DEIS, ES-3). What does the historical knowledge of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, the Yavapai people, and other Indigenous peoples reveal about the cultural and religious resources of the area affected by the RCPLE? 
4. Identify the cultural and religious values of the Native medicine men, elders, and the spiritual pilgrims who have come to the RCPLE affected area. 
TNF must engage in meaningful government-to-government relations and consultations in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA; the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (AIRFA), 16 U.S.C. Â§ 470a(a)(6)(A) and (B); Presidential Executive Memorandum related to “Government-to- Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments” 59 Fed.

As noted above (EPA PEJWFRTIP) adds specificity to what constitutes meaningful relations and consultation in the area of environmental protection of Indian land, especially sacred sites. EPA PEJWFRTIP “recognizes the importance of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the principles that are consistent with the mission and authorities of the Agency.”

"3.6.02","Air Quality: Sensitive Airsheds (Class I and Class II)","3.6","Section 3.6 - Air Quality"," Construction, mining operations, tailings piles, the subsidence zone, vehicle emissions from trucks, and reclamation activities related to the proposed Resolution Copper Mine and along transportation and utility corridors will increase dust, airborne chemicals, and mobile emissions in the region and could compromise air quality standards. Particulate matter 2.5 microns in size (PM 2.5 ) would increase over background levels and particulate matter 10 microns in size (PM 10 ) would also increase over background levels, and could contribute to an exceedance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulates, which is a health-based standard. Air emissions from the proposed Resolution Copper Mine could cause and contribute to the degradation of visibility in the Superstition Wilderness Class I airshed and the impacts to that airshed are underestimated in the DEIS. 
Mines are known to create problems with blowing dust due to many miles of dirt roads, and exposed and denuded surfaces such as tailings and waste rock piles. Due to the amount of subsidence associated with this mine, it is quite likely the entire area will be devoid of vegetation and that also means more dust. This was not adequately addressed in the DEIS. The dust related to mining activities can contain a variety of toxic materials, and can cause exceedances of health-based air quality standards, as well as provisions that protect Class I airsheds such as the Superstition Wilderness. The Forest Service has underestimated the impacts of the air pollution that would be generated by this mine on the health of both employees and area residents, region-wide visual impact on scenery and view sheds, and the impact on plant and animal life. Consideration of the impacts on recreational values and property values was also not adequately considered. 
There are real and significant public health issues related to particulate emissions. When particulates (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) are inhaled, they can affect the heart and lungs and increase respiratory symptoms, irritation of the airways, coughing, breathing difficulty, and more. The elderly, children, and those with respiratory or other health issues are at greatest risk relative to particulate pollution. A study released in 2008 by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) showed that when the levels of PM 10 in Central Phoenix were high, there was a significant increase in asthma incidents in children (Arizona Children’s Health Challenge Grant, 2008).

The impacts of these emissions on public health and the environment, potential contamination of water, and other factors should have been thoroughly evaluated in the DEIS. "

The likelihood that the air quality in the National Forest and surrounding residential areas such as Superior, Queen Valley, and Superstition Vistas will be degraded by both dust and truck exhaust associated with mine operations is significant. "
"3.6.05","Air Quality: General","3.6","Section 3.6 - Air Quality","the DEIS acknowledges other projects in the area that affect air quality, but then fails to adequately account for the impacts of those projects on overall air quality in the area. The Pinto Valley Mine Expansion will increase particulate pollution as well as pollution associated with diesel exhaust, yet the DEIS just indicates “…no data are available at this time to determine how these potential future increases may cumulatively affect overall air quality in the analysis area.” (DEIS at pg. 292). Likewise, the DEIS dismisses impacts from the proposed Ray Mine land exchange by stating “…however, no details are currently available as to potential environmental effects, including to air quality, resulting from this possible future mining operation.” (DEIS at pg. 292). These statements in the DEIS result in an inaccurate picture of emissions in the region and no real cumulative impacts analysis of the impacts to air quality, impacts that present real potential health impacts to the public and real potential negative impacts to Class I airsheds.

This project, along with the others proposed for the region, could contribute to additional exceedances of air quality standards. Air pollutants emitted as a result of the mine’s activities (including but not limited to coarse and fine particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide) would negatively affect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) established under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7409. 

The Filter Plant and Loadout Facility, portions of the Magma Arizona Railroad Company (MARRCO) Corridor, and most of EPS are already within the boundaries of a designated PM 10 non-attainment area (pg. 37 of Mining Plan of Operations).

"3.6.06","Air Quality: Mitigation","3.6","Section 3.6 - Air Quality","     The DEIS should have evaluated a full range of measures to mitigate the impacts to air quality, including revegetation with native plant species, minimizing travel on dirt roads or cross-country, minimizing and finding alternative locations for tailings, and the full range of best management practices for reducing air pollutants. Monitoring and mitigation strategies for fugitive dust may not be sufficient or might cause new problems. The dust-suppression program for the gravel roads used at Project sites that involves periodic watering and/or chemical treatment (page 205 MPO) creates additional issues including further increasing water usage and adding more chemicals to the area. Additionally, the plan to set reasonable speed limits on access roads within the General Project Area (GPA) (page 205 MPO) falls short as a dust-prevention solution since no enforcement strategies are set forth to ensure vehicles will obey speed limits. Further, the strategy to mitigate fugitive dust emissions remains vague, as it states the emissions ""will be monitored and actively managed with sprinklers and dust suppressants as necessary"" (page 205 MPO). However, the plan does not expand upon the amount of fugitive dust ""necessary"" to trigger action. That should be identified and evaluated in the DEIS. The DEIS should have studied in detail the fugitive dust potential of all tailings designs and systems being considered, as well as the site-specific impacts fugitive dust problems would have at any of the proposed tailings locations.

The DEIS does not address this issue related to air quality and impact on public health.

The combination of ozone, NOx and sulfates can photochemically oxidize arsenic, chromium, nickel and manganese. The oxidation of arsenic will produce arsenates which are soluble and/or sorbed on sulfates and sulfuric acid mist. Thus, arsenic can disperse by two atmospheric routes: as particulate matter and as soluble materials suspended in aerosols, the latter moving with the ozone/NOx/sulfate plume. Because this second form of dispersal of toxic materials is unmonitored under present DEIS requirements, arsenic emissions can produce a violation of the hazardous air pollutant requirements. The aerosol transport mechanism will also increase human and ecological exposure to arsenic compounds. The arsenic sources include tailings piles and possible volatile process emissions.

It is marginally suited to the complex terrain (mountains, mesas, etc.) and regional scale topography of the various areas in Arizona likely to be impacted by air pollution from the mine. It is also a model recommended by EPA for preliminary calculations. The CALPUFFS model is suited to the urban environment. It has a chemical reaction subroutine based on linear kinetics. In many cases, the very dilute nature of atmospheric concentrations of various reacting species permits linear approximations. It is also a model recommended by EPA. However, neither model can handle aerosols or photochemistry. AERMOD has no chemical reaction subroutine. At best, the combined use of AERMOD and CALPUFF can approximate any local chemical interactions as additive systems with linear kinetics, but with unknown errors. The concern in using these two models is their inability to assess the effect of the mine on the urban environment when there is a non-linear chemical interaction between urban plumes and the mine plume such as local production of ozone.

The DEIS requires no measurements of radioactivity of particulates. During the processes of extracting copper and molybdenum, if these radioactive components of the ore become soluble, their soluble state will allow them to pass through many of the processes untouched. Many of these radioactive elements also can form volatile fluorides and the presence of fluoride in the ore materials, allows the formation of these compounds in various processing steps under appropriate conditions. Neither the background documents nor the DEIS indicate that such conditions are not found in the various steps, and therefore the formation of these radioactive compounds cannot be dismissed.

Several biotic communities (Interior Chaparral, Madrean Evergreen Woodland, Interior Riparian Deciduous Forest and the Arizona Upland Subdivision of Sonoran Desertscrub) converge in a relatively small area around the proposed mine site. This combination of complex biotic communities interspersed with riverine, pond, and cliff habitat, attract an abundance of avifauna to Oak Flat and the surrounding area (Oak Flat). Individual observations, E Bird listings, North American Migration Count (NAMC), and Audubon Christmas Bird counts combine to offer a rich picture of the birds that utilize the proposed mine site. In addition, Westland Resources (Westland), compiled prior data, conducted independent surveys, and published the Bird Survey and Occurrence Record Compilation in 2012. This compilation documents the occurrence of 172 bird species at Oak Flat. 
Data Analysis 
Data from previous surveys and independent observations allow the FS a rare opportunity to thoroughly evaluate the impact the proposed RCM project will have on native biota. Although, RCM considered federally listed and USFS Migratory Species of Concern, relatively little mention was made of how the hundred or so other potentially vulnerable species will be affected. In order to rectify this deficiency, we recommended in our scoping comments that all bird observations at Oak Flat should be cross-referenced with the following vulnerability ratings: 
● North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NACBI) Watch list—State of the Birds Report (2016). 
● Arizona Department of Game and Fish (AzGFD)—Species of Greatest Concentration Need (SGCN). This list should be updated to include all species that have been observed in the Affected Area (AA). 
● Partners in Flight (Arizona Bird Conservation Initiative or ABCI) Priority Species Rankings—include all birds with a score of 20 and above. 
● Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA)—All birds sighted in the AA should be included in the analysis. 
● The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) listings (endangered, threatened, candidate, and species of concern). 
● The US Forest Service (FS)—Management Indicator Species (MIS), Sensitive (S), and Migratory Species of Concern (MSBC). The latter two lists should be updated to actually reflect the bird species that occur in in the AA. 
It appears from the DEIS that some of these resources were consulted, while others were not. In our scoping comments, to examine the rarity of birds that utilize Oak Flat, we cross-referenced Westland’s avian compilation data with scorings from NABCI. This first-ever conservation vulnerability assessment of all native bird species that occur in Canada, the continental U.S., and Mexico was compiled by a team of experts from all three countries. This analysis, based on vulnerability scores from multiple factors, created a Watch List of species of the highest conservation concern. Birds with scores of 14 or higher, or a concern score of 13 and a deeply declining population trend, were considered to be in jeopardy of extinction without the application of significant conservation measures. In addition to the two federally listed birds that have been observed in the AA, nine species met the Watch List criteria. Birds identified by the NACBI Watch List should be provided the same treatment as federally listed species in terms of the level of detailed analysis, impact avoidance, minimization and mitigation measures . In addition, 7 other bird species nearly made the Watch List with scores of 13. Impacts to these declining species should also be analyzed and their utilization of Oak Flat should be closely monitored.

For all bird species known to be of conservation concern, the EIS should evaluate the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of the proposed mine, to include the following: 
What will the impacts to avifauna be from the dewatering, and subsequent devegetation of riparian areas and aquatic habitats? 
How will loss of habitat from the subsidence crater and ancillary facilities impact resident, breeding and wintering avifauna? 
How will powerlines affect birds? Will they create additional nest/perching sites for predatory species e.g. ravens? 
What impact will the loss of avian breeding and wintering habitats have on native bird populations? 
How will water pollution and waste/settling ponds affect avifauna and successful migration? 
How will noise pollution, vibrations from equipment and lighting impact these species? How will these impacts affect migration, breeding behaviors and breeding success?

How will a dramatic increase in edges and “edge effects” due to mine construction and ancillary facilities impact breeding behaviors and success (e.g. noise impacts to bird communication and other breeding behaviors, and increased avian predation and nest parasitism)? In general, the section evaluating impacts to avifauna is superficial and lacking serious analysis of the overall impacts. While there is a table listing modeled acreage of habitat for species potentially affected and some general discussion of potential impacts, the DEIS lacks detailed analysis of consequences for population dynamics, esp. differentiated among species. It is quite likely that some species will be more seriously impacted than others, yet there avifauna impacts are lumped into a general discussion of potential impacts that are then routinely dismissed as having no impact on populations.

Surveys conducted by Westland ( Results of Bird Surveys Conducted at Near West, 2013 ) in April and June of 2013 discovered a total of 59 bird species. While these data provide a good foundation for an avian inventory, it is likely that these abbreviated surveys missed numerous species. For example, during a field trip to the TSF in the spring of 2016, Maricopa Audubon members observed numerous bird species that were not observed by Westland. Records from the nearly adjacent Boyce Thompson Arboretum document the occurrence of over 200 bird species. Birding trips by Maricopa Audubon Society members to Happy Camp Canyon, Potts Canyon, Hewitt Canyon and across the Montana Road suggest, that birds found on, or near, the TSF may be utilizing desert washes that extend from the Queen Creek drainage to migrate into the Superstition Wilderness. Maricopa Audubon birding trips in spring of 2016 documented an abundance of migrants in riparian vegetation, including Bell’s Vireo, Black-headed Grosbeaks, Lark Sparrows, and Western Tanagers. Due to the relatively small amount of data that has been collected on the Near West TSF, it is likely that the importance of this area to migratory bird species has been underestimated.

 On April 18, 2010, an ocelot was killed by a motorist near the proposed mine site on Highway 60 between Superior and Top of the World. At the behest of federal and state officials, the ocelot’s carcass underwent a forensic analysis that determined the ocelot was wild in origin. The nearest known breeding population of ocelots is currently thought to be located in northern Sonora, Mexico. The highway where the ocelot died is further away from the Sonoran breeding population than any ocelot dispersal distances documented in the scientific literature. Therefore, it is possible a breeding population exists in southern Arizona. Furthermore, based upon known habitat characteristics of the Sonoran population, suitable habitat for the ocelot clearly exists in the AA. Inexplicably, the DEIS analysis completely lacks any discussion or analysis of ocelot in the AA. A keyword search indicates that the only place this species is mentioned throughout the DEIS is in discussion of sensitive species that could occur on a few of the exchange parcels offered by the proponent. That this species is being suggested as possibly occurring on these parcels (where there is no record of it occurring), but not in the AA (where there is a relatively recent record of it occurring), seriously undermines the credibility of the DEIS. One of the parcels mentioned as possibly harboring ocelot is Dripping Springs, yet there is no consideration in the DEIS analysis of the possibility of ocelot occurring at the nearby Skunk Camp tailings location, let alone the consequences of destroying thousands of acres of potential habitat. Instead, the document plays up the possibility of ocelot occurring in the exchange parcel, apparently to inflate its perceived ecological value. What rational explanation could there be for such glaring deficiencies and contradictions in the DEIS? No ocelots have been detected near the AA since the individual mortality in 2011, but this does not necessarily prove the absence of the species. Ocelots are notoriously difficult to survey for, as they have relatively small home ranges compared to other wild cats and prefer to move cryptically in dense cover as much as possible. However, there is plenty of good habitat in the AA with dense vegetation, substantial prey base and permanent water that would be perfectly suitable for ocelot habitation, so it is entirely possible that other individuals persist in the area. In order to evaluate this important, yet elusive endangered species, the FS should conduct the following, as outlined in our scoping comments: 
Investigate all unconfirmed sightings of ocelots. 
Work in conjunction with federal and state agencies to conduct a credible survey for ocelot in the affected area using a variety of techniques, such as camera traps, scat analysis, hair traps, etc. 
Map and analyze the impact of the proposed action on suitable/potential habitats and movement corridors. 
Evaluate the impact of the proposed action upon the potential for future ocelot natural recolonization and/or reintroductions to the affected area.

Surveys for Sonoran Desert Tortoise (SDT) were conducted on the Near West TSF during late summer of 2012 and 2013 (Results of Sonoran Desert Tortoise Survey in the Tonto National Forest Near Superior Arizona (2013). Findings from this study suggest that the Near West provides quality, year round habitat for this species. Westland concluded that tortoises were widely distributed throughout the study area, with increased concentrations noted in certain desert washes. Unfortunately, the limited scope of these surveys did not permit density calculations for SDT that inhabit the proposed TSF. It is also highly likely that Sonoran desert tortoise inhabit the other TSF location alternatives as well. 
Core, higher density populations of this species tend to be “island like” and associated with steeper terrain and aspects, making the species very vulnerable to connectivity disruptions associated with the development of mines, roads, transmission lines, pipelines, and other associated infrastructure. In addition, ravens have been documented use transmission lines as a means to scout out and prey upon young tortoises. The DEIS mentions some of these impacts and discusses “applicant committed” measures to address them as part of a Candidate Conservation Agreement between USFWS and Resolution Copper, including pre-construction surveys and removals, but the details of this agreement are not discussed, nor is the mechanism by which it would be implemented and enforced, other than a “voluntary” commitment by the proponent.0
 Although a “not warranted” decision concerning the listing of the SDT was made by the FWS, there are still significant concerns about their survival. In order to help prevent a future listing of the SDT the FS should address the following concerns: 
●Conduct SDT surveys throughout the TSFs that enable density to be calculated. 
●Quantify how the destruction of a significant amount of SDT habitat will impact the Superstition tortoise population. 
●How will edge effects impact tortoise habitat selection, movements, breeding behaviors and breeding success? For example, powerlines often provide nesting/perching structures for avian predators. Will this increase in nesting substrate result in predation of SDT juveniles? What will the impact of raven predation be? How will this be avoided, addressed and/or mitigated for? 
●How will the footprint of RCM’s proposed project, including roads and ancillary facilities, impact desert tortoise burrows? For example, how many tortoise burrows are anticipated to be caved-in and lost due to the development of the proposed mine and associated human activities and maintenance?

"3.7.05","Water Resources: Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," As noted in the water section herein, contrary to preliminary analysis supplied by the proponent, there appears to be a hydrological connection between deeper groundwater areas that will be dewatered due to mining activity and a shallow groundwater layer near the surface of the AA. This carries the potential to impact many springs in the area. Springs are keystone features of the landscape, providing microhabitat for specific spring-dependent plant and invertebrate species and water sources for a myriad of animal species. Many spring dependent species are rare and endemic. 
 While there appears to be only one mapped spring in the land exchange/subsidence area, three unmapped springs in the vicinity were visited and surveyed by Sky Island Alliance (SIA) staff and volunteers in December 2015, including a large cienega and a small cave seep within the land exchange/subsidence area and a deep pool in a drainage close to the edge of that impacted area. Subsequent visual observations of these areas in the following years have revealed dramatic drop in available surface water, indicating that they may already be suffering damage from the effects of dewatering, either in the deeper aquifer or in the shallow groundwater areas as a result of exploratory drilling. Several more surface water areas were observed that could be the result of spring flow, but these were not formally surveyed. It is highly likely that the three surveyed springs within and immediately adjacent to the land exchange/subsidence zone would be dewatered and destroyed by further dewatering. 
 A 1901 topo map (available at http://historicalmaps.arcgis.com/usgs/ ) indicates that travel routes through the Oak Flat area passed immediately adjacent to the three springs SIA surveyed. SIA has noted that in some areas that contain many springs, a significant percentage are unmapped, as only the most useful (for human needs) tend to show up on historical maps, so it is likely that there are more springs in the Oak Flat area that have simply not been mapped or studied. A thorough search for evidence of springs in the area should be conducted, and any extant springs that are found should be formally surveyed, including the documentation of rare and endemic species. 
 The DEIS states that “There are 338 springs mapped within 5 miles of the project footprint. This includes 24 springs and several stream segments that are considered to be groundwater dependent with the potential to be impacted by the project” (Ch. 3, p. 452). The DEIS then states that “many of these springs would not be impacted by project activities unless directly within the project footprint.” It is quite possible that the effects of groundwater pumping/dewatering will reach far beyond the immediate land exchange/subsidence area, depending on hydrology, and it is very likely that far more of these surface waters are groundwater dependent and will be damaged or destroyed by further dewatering. A thorough, independent analysis should be conducted with regard to the hydrology of the area, how it fits within the larger region, and particularly with regard to impacts to regional spring resources, as these locations are critically important to many plant and wildlife species. 
 In general, it appears that the Oak Flat area is an important shallow groundwater area with much potential to support springs, and it is likely that historical and ongoing mining activities have already negatively impacted or obliterated surface waters. Many drainages in the area have mesic habitat, more than what would generally be expected for an area of such relatively sparse rainfall. The EIS should analyze all available historical data to determine to the greatest extent possible what spring resources have already been lost and the potential for further losses, in order to fully inform its analysis of the potential cumulative impacts of groundwater pumping/dewatering that would result from RCM and the proposed TSFs.

In general, avoidance and mitigation measures discussed in the DEIS and in the Draft CWA Section 404 Conceptual Compensatory Mitigation Plan in Appendix D are either woefully inadequate to actually compensate for damage done by the proposed action, lacking sufficient detail to assess their likely effectiveness, or absent altogether in many instances. It is essential that the public be provided with an opportunity to comment on a complete, thorough mitigation proposal before the EIS is finalized. “Voluntary” commitments by the proponent and brief, vague “conceptual” plans thwart meaningful public input and are not sufficient under the law. The DEIS states that as part of the mitigation plan “most water sources potentially impacted by the project would be replaced”, but does not make it clear whether there will be consideration of the relative ecological value in this equation (Ch. 3, p. 480). Replacing natural springs with stock tanks or other artificial water sources is a poor substitute for a fully functioning spring ecosystem and the diversity of species it supports. Even more problematic, the DEIS states that the loss of habitat “would not be replaced in the immediate project area”, which severely limits the effectiveness of the mitigation and tends to make the damage done by lost habitat permanent and irreplaceable as far as the project area is concerned. In general, the DEIS cites the value of the exchanged lands as adding to the overall mitigation of projected impacts, but many of these parcels are far away from the project area, in entirely different watersheds and containing different habitats. Moreover, the general value of the exchange parcels pales in comparison to what would be lost in the project area (see our analysis of the exchange parcels elsewhere in these comments), rendering their mitigation value minimal at best.

Dust and haze would diminish visibility, and airborne particulates could pose a health risk to those desiring physical exercise (hiking, climbing, biking, jogging, etc.). Seismic activity related to subsidence could pose a threat in certain recreational areas, and water-based recreation associated with springs, streams, ponds, and waterfalls would be affected by mine dewatering and by the diversion and damming of certain drainages. In addition, these areas may become overcrowded and degraded from overuse when Oak Flat and other recreational resources are no longer available for a growing population of outdoor enthusiasts.

The same topographic features that discourage unauthorized off-road travel also act as acoustic baffles, limiting the noise level affect of ATVs and shooters to hikers, campers and equestrians in the immediate area. A Resolution Copper project area closure that would displace OHV traffic to other areas would increase noise levels in these areas disproportionate to any scenario envisioned in a no-action alternative.

Some of that Act’s language is summarized in the DEIS, with the only additional information being that the appraisal process began on December 12, 2017, and that an appraiser was selected and began work in 2019 (Volume 1, Chapter 2, p. 35). The appraiser was not identified. The four short paragraphs simply repeat the Act’s language that the appraisal report, or a summary thereof, will be made available for public review prior to the completion of the land exchange. 
 Why is at least a preliminary appraisal report not included in the DEIS? The Act gave Resolution Copper special privilege in making reports valid for at least three years, so there is no deadline problem, given the Final EIS is expected in about one year. The appraisal process is at the heart of the land exchange and figures prominently in helping offset the environmental impacts of the mine and is deserving of public review. There is no meaningful public review when appraisals are released close to publication of the Final EIS or between the FEIS and Decision Notice. Additionally, not only has Resolution Copper stated repeatedly that all aspects of mine review be contained in one NEPA document, the NDAA itself required the use of a single EIS for all federal actions.

When evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of the Resolution mine project, the appraiser should consider that outdoor recreation contributes more than twice as many dollars to Arizona as all of mining does—over $10 billion annually, compared to less than $5 billion for the entire mining industry. These figures come from the Outdoor Industry Association and the Arizona Mining Association, respectively. USFS should also consider that recreation is sustainable and can contribute to Arizona’s bottom line in perpetuity. "

Such an approach is not required. It is not possible to determine from this language to what extent the income capitalization approach will be employed, but it is worthwhile noting that the Uniform Appraisal Standard for Federal Land Acquisitions discourages its use. It is not clear what the Uniform Standards are for Federal Lands that are offered for disposal, but it is obvious that the comparative sales approach is considered far superior, even when good comparative sales are not available. It is our assumption that this is true for disposing of federal lands as well as acquisitions.

The DEIS gives no explanation why appraisal information is not available and is mute on when the public might see it.

"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Alternative Mining Techniques 
Much of the controversy surrounding Resolution Copper’s General Plan of Operations regards the subsidence crater at Oak Flat. In the 2017 Draft Alternatives Evaluation Report and its corresponding Appendix C, as well as in the Resolution Copper DEIS, arguments are made to dismiss any and all possible alternative to Resolution Copper’s preferred mining method of panel caving. Earthworks believes the general dismissal by the Forest Service of taking a hard look at these alternative mining techniques – which would leave Oak Flat intact for the numerous Native American and social groups who use the area regularly and hold it sacred – runs contrary to the intention of the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as its general role of stewards of the land recognizing a multiple use approach. 
Unfortunately, instead of taking this hard look, the Forest Service appears to have simply accepted – via SWCA Environmental Consultants -- a report from Dr. Charles Kliche entitled Technical Memorandum for Alternative Mining Methods. Dr. David Chambers, who like Dr. Kliche is also a physical engineer with 40 years of experience in mining and geotechnical engineering, contributed to the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition’s comments on this topic. Had he been the chosen consultant to write about alternative mining techniques for the DEIS through SWCA, his conclusion would be vastly different than Dr. Kliche’s in terms of the economic feasibility of other mining techniques. This is an indication that the Forest Service should have consulted multiple independent parties on this topic and compared findings, before simply accepting for the DEIS the conclusion of a single person and a single report, prepared by a for-profit large consultancy that likely has many ties to the mining industry.
 It is clear that the Forest Service acknowledges that other mining techniques will vastly reduce or eliminate surface impacts at Oak Flat (Alternatives Evaluation Report, p. 25): The Forest Service recognizes and agrees with scoping comments that use of mining techniques other than panel caving could substantially reduce impacts to surface resources, both by reducing or eliminating subsidence and by allowing the potential to backfill tailings underground.
 In all materials, Dr. Kliche and the Forest Service also acknowledge that alternative mining techniques are technically feasible. Cost is cited as the prohibitive factor for any technique other than panel caving – Resolution’s preferred method for profit maximization. But the data provided in the DEIS and the technical memorandum is open to interpretation, and therefore needs far more detailed analysis in a revised or supplemental DEIS.

"ALT01","Alternatives Development Process ","ALT","Alternatives","Project Viability 
A major concern of the Resolution Copper deposit relates to its characteristics and grade. For this to be true, figures for grade and tonnage have to be correct, crushing and grinding circuits have to be configured appropriately and metallurgical methods for metal recovery have to be determined correctly. Consulting groups to the Resolution Copper company have calculated figures for the grade and tonnage of the deposit and designed the engineering requirements for the mine. The reserve figures have not been quoted, commented on, criticized or questioned in the DEIS, and seem acceptable to the USFS. The reason for lack of comment on the reserves is unexplained. For review and approval of a mining project this seems to be a blatant omission. If mining went ahead based on inaccurate reserve figures and eventually had to be abandoned as uneconomic, the environmental impact of an abandoned mine could be great and local life and business would have been disrupted, all for no gain. The Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition, many of whom have mined at Oak Flat in the old Magma operations and also have experience working in the block cave operation at the San Manuel mine have long raised concerns about the ability to use block cave mining at Oak Flat. They report that it’s likely that due to high temperatures, pressures and persistent wet conditions, and due to the nature of the ore body, that rather than “flow like sand in an hourglass” through the draws below the block cave operation, ore would not break up efficiently and plug up the draws. This would not only slow operations and cost more in resources and money, but would be very unsafe for mine workers. If enough of the draws plug, the entire operation could become unviable. These concerns were discussed in our scoping comments and are certainly known by the Forest Service, but were not discussed in the DEIS. In order to clarify whether the deposit is viable or not, a new or supplemental DEIS must be prepared. "

"3.3.02","Soils and Vegetation: Revegetation","3.3","Section 3.3 - Soils and Vegetation"," Revegetation The variability and unpredictability in the amount of precipitation in the Oak Flat area is likely to influence which species germinate and become established on site, irrespective of whatever seed mix is used. Under actual field conditions, only some of the species in the selected seed mix are likely to respond well during any seeding event. Thus, the plant mixture that becomes established in the field is likely to differ from that desired or planned. Continuing droughts are likely to lead to a high probability that conditions will not provide for the appropriate selection to germinate and become established. There appears to be no provision for irrigation of reseeded areas during the 20 years of planned mining and no provision for this after mine closure. However, assuming some irrigation during the early mine life, some plantings may be established after 20 years but the plantings of later years will not. Provision needs to be made to irrigate the reclaimed areas for a long period, for example 15-20 years after mine closure. Young plants will not survive without irrigation on dirt covered waste piles during long, hot, dry periods, which will occur yearly in this area. ( Witness the failure of the promised landscaping of the waste dumps north of the Duval Mine Road and east of La Canada. When the mine closed, the irrigation was turned off, and the new vegetation has since died.) "
"3.10.07","Public Health and Safety: Impacts from Pipelines","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","  Tailings pipeline 
The tailings pipelines for this proposed project would be huge (up to 36” in diameter). A pipeline that large would be comprised of lengths of (in this case) steel pipeline not longer than what could be trucked to the site and joined with couplings. This would result in many hundreds of couplings for the longer routes envisioned in Alternative 5 and 6. Coupling points are more prone to abrasion. The north pipeline corridor route which is the preferred route, traverses very rough country with many changes in elevation and hairpin turns. This route would be much more prone to pipeline failure than other alternatives. The DEIS is incorrect in assuming that, like a petroleum pipeline, a leak could be stopped simply by turning a valve. The pressure, volume, and pipeline size make that impossible. Instead, the shutdown procedure for repairing a tailings pipeline leak of this size is to first ramp down and finally shut off the flow of material at the West plant, allow the tailings slurry to drain out of the pipeline and then to blow out the line all before a repair can be made. This must be done in a very short time period or else the tailings would solidify in the pipeline (this is why it needs to be blown out). 
This results in a tremendous amount of toxic tailings on the ground as the volume of material in the pipeline has to be totally removed from the line. Only then can the pipelined be repaired. Once the repair is made, the line has to be chemically lubricated before tailings can then flow through the pipeline. If a rupture occurs in a sensitive area, like in a pipeline crossing of Ga’an Canyon, the result would be an environmental disaster. In order to get quickly to the site of a pipeline rupture and to get replacement material and pipe to the rupture site requires well maintained access roads large enough to accommodate large 18 wheel semi-truck capable of carrying replacement pipe. 
None of these environmental concerns were addressed in the DEIS. There is no assessment of the effects on the environment from the chemical lubricant used in these pipelines and how that lubricant is disposed of. Would it end up permanently mixed with the toxic tailings? Why didn’t the DEIS look at effects the lubricant would have on water quality? A new or supplemental DEIS must be written that address these concerns.

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety"," Wet versus Dry Closure
 Dry closure is considered safer than wet closure, because with a wet closure where containment is lost the tailings usually flush from the breach and travel downgradient with considerable force and for a great distance. In the case of wet PAG tailings, if containment is lost then oxidation of this material can be rapid and widespread. The closure scheme proposed for Alternative 6 – Skunk Camp would have a drain system under the NPAG tailings that could be utilized to keep these tailings largely unsaturated. Although the ideal dry closure would be with dry tailings, drained tailings is the next best choice. And, although the two PAG impoundments would be wet, they are also totally contained behind and buried by the NPAG tailings. This provides an additional physical barrier to release in the event of a structural failure.

Use of the 1:10,000 year return period earthquake as the design earthquake for the tailings dams, as is done for the Preferred Alternative, is the appropriate choice for the design event. Too many agencies use a lesser earthquake as the design event for a structure that is meant to function in perpetuity, so it is good to see the US Forest Service require the appropriate design earthquake. The seismic analysis for the EIS is largely based on a report by Wong et. al (2013). The Wong et. al (2013) report was focused on analyzing four specific sites that were under consideration at that time: the Far West Tailings Management Area: Far West 1 and Far West 2; the Near West Tailings Management Area; and, the Pinto Valley Operations (PVO) Tailings Management Area. 
The Proposed Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) was not analyzed in this report. The Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option, would occupy the upper portion of Dripping Spring Valley, the northeastern slopes and foothills of the Dripping Spring Mountains, and the southwestern foothills of the Pinal Mountains, including a 4-mile reach of Dripping Spring Wash, a 3.5-mile reach of Stone Cabin Wash, and a 4.8-mile reach of Skunk Camp Wash. Cornwall, Banks, and Phillips (1971), map an extensive fault structure running the length of Dripping Spring Wash. This fault is not mentioned in the Wong et al (2013) report or the DEIS (2019). This fault most probably bisects the dams and impoundments, so should merit further investigation and discussion in the DEIS. The DEIS does not specify the location of the 1:10,000 year event, or the assumed magnitude of this event. 
In the Wong et al report (2013) it is noted that the values calculated for the PGA are ""significantly lower"" than the values from the USGS Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA) and (USGS 2008). The USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps are typically used to develop the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA) for a mine location. The US Forest Service should require the use of the most conservative estimates for seismic events because of the extremely long time period for which tailings facilities are planned to function. In addition, the USGS has updated its National Seismic Hazard Maps (2014) since the Wong et. al. report (2013) was written. At a minimum the seismic study needs to be updated to reflect current information, and to include an analysis of the Preferred Alternative site, which was not included in the 2013 report. The EIS must use up to date information, make conservative assumptions about the size and location of the maximum credible earthquake, and must disclose the location and magnitude of the maximum credible earthquake used for the design earthquake for the tailings dam. In light of several recent earthquakes near Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico, just south of the Arizona border, the seismic analysis should be updated to assess whether this is a problem that could migrate north.

"CHAP2","Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives","CH2","Chapter 2"," Tailings Disposal Facilities 
The DEIS identifies tailings disposal facilities as tailings storage facilities.

As disposal facilities tailings sites are proposals with irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources. As permanent waste disposal sites, tailings disposal facilities alternatives should be subject to analysis of potential tailings facility risks and impacts in the event of maximum probable events for precipitation, flood, and earthquakes for all potential tailings sites. 
 Failure to consider peak and maximum probable events result in the tailings facilities being unable to demonstrate safety and stability through out the long-term, multi-century period where the wastes will present potential risks to people and the environment. "

In preparation for this DEIS, the Forest Service and Resolution Copper went to a great deal of effort to conduct Baseline Characterization tests of the Near West tailings alternative. Indeed, the agency successfully defended its action in federal court, saying such testing is needed as part of its review of the main mine. As the Forest Service stated to the federal court: Before consummating the land exchange, the Forest Service must first prepare an environmental impact statement (“EIS”) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) that assesses the potential environmental impact of the land exchange, the Proposed Mine and MPO, and federal actions to authorize associated operations and facilities on land that will remain federally owned.

 To prepare that EIS, the Forest Service must obtain baseline data on federal land in the Tonto National Forest that is not part of the land exchange. Federal Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Case 2:16-cv-03115-DGC Document 41 Filed 03/17/17, at p. 1 (emphasis added). In June 2013, Resolution submitted a Plan of Operations for the Baseline Project in an area of the Tonto National Forest located approximately one mile northwest of the town of Superior. AR17546. 
The purpose of the Baseline Project is to gather additional hydrological and geotechnical data that will be used in a forthcoming EIS to determine if the site is suitable for a proposed tailings storage facility, one part of Resolution’s Proposed Mine. Id. Id . at 2 (emphasis added). Despite the agency’s stated position that such baseline geotechnical and other baseline information is needed to support review of a tailings location in the DEIS, such analysis was not done for the other tailings locations – especially for the agency’s preferred location in Skunk Camp. In addition, regarding the tests/analysis that was done for the proposed tailings location, we have asked the Forest Service more than once for the results of those tests and they have not been provided. Nor are they provided in this DEIS.
 For example, the agency does not explain the likelihood that the tests showed that the water table was much higher and the ground was more fractured than anticipated. We do not know whether this is a factor in the choosing of the Skunk Camp alternative as the preferred alternative. This baseline characterization is a key piece of information to make decisions on the Near West alternative. The Tonto National Forest did not obtain similar baseline characterization data for the other 3 tailings alternatives. It is especially troubling that the Forest Service would choose a preferred tailings alternative without this key piece of information. 
Currently the Forest Service does not definitively know whether the Skunk Camp tailings alternative is physically viable, as it was required to do for the initial proposed location. What happens if the Forest Service does the baseline characterization at a later date and finds that for any number of reasons that would be answered by the baseline characterization, that the Skunk Camp site is not suitable? Or would the Forest Service simply pass the buck and approve that alternative and let another agency make that determination. NEPA requires a hard look at the project alternatives and not providing baseline characterization on all the alternatives violated NEPA. A new or supplemental DEIS must be written to answer these questions.

(See Emerman’s report with the same title in the Appendix) 
Hydrologic and geologic expert, Dr. Steve Emerman, conducted an evaluation of the Maximum design earthquake for the tailings storage facilities for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona. Four of the five alternatives (Peg Leg site, Skunk Camp site, and two at the Near West site) for the tailings storage facilities for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine, Arizona involve the storage of thickened tailings (50-70% solids), while one alternative (Silver King site) involves the storage of filtered tailings (86-89% solids). According to a wide range of dam safety standards, a dam for which the failure would result in the loss of human life should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE), the largest earthquake that is theoretically possible within a particular seismotectonic setting. Using a statistical model based on previous tailings dam failures, the runouts from the failures of the five alternatives would be in the range 200-370 miles. Although the flow potential of filtered tailings is less than that of thickened tailings, even if the failures of the dams for the filtered tailings caused only slumping of the tailings, they would travel at least 10,400 feet from the Silver King site, and would impact the town of Superior (population 2,837) at a minimum distance of 2,500 feet. The unincorporated area of Queen Valley (population 820) would be impacted by the failures of either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance 19,000 feet) or of the Silver King facility (minimum distance 8.2 miles). The town of Florence (population 26,074) would be impacted by the failures of the Peg Leg facility (minimum distance 10.3 miles), either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance 16.0 miles), or the Silver King facility (minimum distance 20.5 miles). The unincorporated area of Dripping Springs (population 235) would be impacted by the failure of the Skunk Camp facility (minimum distance 17,000 feet). Dripping Springs, Queen Valley and Superior are all well within what has been called the “self-rescue zone” in recent Brazilian legislation. On the above basis, the tailings storage facilities should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake, rather than the 5,000-year earthquake that was proposed by Rio Tinto. It is recommended that anyone interested in investing in the Resolution Copper Mine should enquire as to the additional cost of designing for the MCE.

In October of 2011 the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition implemented a wildlife camera project at Oak Flat to document wildlife and human activity. The study focuses on the Greater Oak Flat Watershed east of Superior, Arizona. The survey area is bounded on the west by Apache Leap, no more than 1 km north of Highway 60 on the north, 1 km east of Gaan Canyon (known as Devil’s Canyon on most maps) on the east, and an arbitrary southern limit. The survey area is primarily public land within the Tonto National Forest, managed by the US Forest Service. The primary human uses of the Greater Oak Flat Watershed include recreation, mining, and cattle grazing (Spangle 2008). The goal of the project aims to assist land managers and decision makers in understanding movement, behavior patterns, and distributions of species that use the watershed and to understand the frequency and movement of human recreational activities within the watershed. A secondary interest was the collection of data to provide a record of the survey area. Such a baseline could prove valuable to future research on the habitat, use, and migration impacts of development. [see letter submittal pgs 173 – 179 for additional information and camera data]

"3.9.01","Recreation: General","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","Recreation 
Adequate mitigation for the loss of recreation at Oak Flat does not exist. Recreation is a major factor in the overwhelming public opposition to RCM. As the TNF is acutely aware, rock climbing, camping, off-road vehicle use, hiking, and wildlife viewing are among the most popular uses of Oak Flat, Queen Creek, Apache Leap, Ga’an Canyon, and the proposed tailings location. Oak Flat has been Federally protected from all mining activity since 1955. In spite of being located in an established mining district, the Eisenhower administration realized the recreational importance of Oak Flat for camping and other recreational uses and specifically withdrew it from mining for those purposes by issuing PLO 1229. Oak Flat is an important and irreplaceable recreational resource for rock climbers and boulderers in Central Arizona. Over the last several decades, climbers from the Phoenix metro area, just 50 miles away, have developed the climbing potential at Oak Flat and turned it into a destination winter climbing area. The proposed Resolution mine project will result in the largest loss of recreational rock climbing in the history of the United States. This will be due to surface subsidence caused by the block cave mining method that Resolution proposes for this project. 
The rock climbing resources at Oak Flat are irreplaceable, and cannot be mitigated for or managed under a 1:1 replacement strategy common in mitigation and restoration plans. Oak Flat climbing is a high value, site-specific resource with significant historical value. For fifteen years running, until 2004, Oak Flat was the location for the world’s largest rock climbing competition—the Phoenix Boulder Blast. With eight hundred competitors and thousands of spectators, the annual event was attended by climbers from across the country and also drew a number of international competitors. Oak Flat is still heavily used by recreational rock climbers and boulderers and the out of print 400-page guidebook to the area by Marty Karabin routinely fetches $200 or more on eBay, due to high demand. The campground itself is also still heavily used and it is often full on weekends during the cooler months. In addition to climbers, hikers, bikers, bird watchers, off-road vehicle riders and others come to Oak Flat for the wonderful recreational opportunities the area affords. The loss of Oak Flat will diminish quality of life measures for those who currently recreate there and will also have negative financial impacts for Oak Flat users, the surrounding communities, and the entire State of Arizona. 
The consideration of alternative mining methods that would allow mining to coexist with ongoing recreational use of Oak Flat (as it has for many decades) was inadequate and must be redone. Methods apart from block or panel caving were rejected on the faulty reasoning that other methods would allow RCM to only extract a smaller percentage of the ore body to which they are legally entitled under the 1872 Mining Act. Any land exchange involving Oak Flat that effectively vacates PLO 1229 will, by definition, convey 100% of the Resolution copper deposit to RCM. RCM would therefore be legally entitled to extract 100% of the copper in question. As the USFS has said many times, it is not the job of the Forest Service to determine how much profit a mine is allowed to make or can make. That is their problem. The Forest Service should therefore perform a detailed mining study that evaluates other mining methods to block caving that would cause no surface subsidence and minimal surface disturbance—so that any future mining at Oak Flat would be compatible with continued recreational and cultural uses of Oak Flat. It is significant that the proposed Twin Metals mine project in Minnesota is envisioning exactly this scenario—backfilling mineworks with tailings to reduce the amount of above ground tailings storage.

"3.13.01","Socioeconomics: General","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics"," No proper socioeconomic study of the mine was done in the DEIS. The socioeconomic impacts of the mine that appear in the DEIS extend only through the lifetime of the mine. When evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of the Resolution mine project, the Forest Service should consider that outdoor recreation contributes more than twice as many dollars to Arizona as all of mining does—over $10 billion annually, compared to less than $5 billion for the entire mining industry. These figures come from the Outdoor Industry Association and the Arizona Mining Association, respectively. USFS should also consider that recreation is sustainable and can contribute to Arizona’s bottom line in perpetuity. That is why doing an economic study only for the life of the mine leads to an erroneously rosy looking picture for the project. The EIS needs to include an extended socioeconomic analysis for this mine project that goes far beyond the mine’s relatively short operating lifetime of roughly 40 years to include the time after mine closure when any financial contribution of the mine to the State will go to zero dollars in perpetuity.

"3.9.01","Recreation: General","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","The recreational significance of Oak Flat cannot be overstated. For more than 60 years it has been managed specifically for recreational use and is widely known as a place where one can picnic, camp, enjoy the scenery, watch wildlife, stargaze, hike, explore, or merely relax in a beautiful natural setting. Although it is nearly a backyard amenity for Superior, it is also used by residents of the Phoenix metropolitan area and by visitors from throughout the region and the nation. The easy access and the rustic, simple, no-fee campground provide an oasis of beauty, calm, and quiet that is open and available to anybody. The DEIS does not acknowledge the qualities that make Oak Flat a unique and meaningful recreational area rather than merely a replaceable commodity. 

Oak Flat and the surrounding region (including Ga’an Canyon, Queen Creek Canyon, and Apache Leap), an hours’ drive from the Phoenix metro area and less than that from the East Valley, has the potential to become a major regional recreational asset. The dramatic rock formations, high cliffs, plunging canyons, gentle valleys, streams, waterfalls, oak groves, and mixed desert and conifer are reminiscent of the Granite Dells area near Prescott and Chiricahua National Monument east of Tucson, both of which are high-value destination points by outdoor recreation seekers. The Oak Flat region could be to Phoenix what those areas are to Prescott and Tucson. The DEIS fails to adequately consider the social and economic value (both short-term and long-term) of the loss of these areas for recreational purposes as they are destroyed, diminished, or fragmented by large-scale industrial development and loss of access.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","Special Use Permits vs. General Plan of Operations for Tailings Pipeline \
As detailed above, the DEIS is based on the USFS’s fundamentally-flawed view of the proper regulatory structure governing Resolution’s proposal to use the remaining federal lands (i.e., lands not exchange away). The DEIS makes virtually no mention of how the Forest Service intends to permit miles of tailings pipelines across its land. The closest the DEIS comes to any discussion is when it says special use permits “may be needed for power lines built by SRP, access roads, or other features” (Volume 1, p. 15). “Other features” are not defined. Elsewhere the DEIS states that SRP power lines could be permitted either by special use permit or as part of the GPO (Volume 1, p. 9). 
The DEIS contains no discussion of the difference between special use permits and permitting as part of the GPO. This omission is major, as the various measures and requirements of the project proponent vary considerably between the two. The northern option for the pipeline route from the west plant site to the Forest Service’s preferred Alternative 6 at Skunk Camp, for example, is about 20 miles long with much of it on Forest Service land. Total facility disturbance and impacts to productivity for this pipeline is 16,116 acres (Volume 3, E-15). 
Impacts from tailings pipelines are obviously substantial. Corridors are 110 – 230 feet wide, and can be 1,000 feet wide in steep areas (Volume 1, p. 57). Corridors will include roads, pumps and apparently transmission lines. Discussion is limited to short sections on pipeline construction techniques and the possible diameter of pipes (Volume 1 p. 47, 51). No real discussion can be found on what the corridor will look like when construction is completed or impacts such as disruption of wildlife movement or loss of recreation opportunities. 
Failing to have identified the method of permitting the tailings pipeline, the DEIS at a minimum should have applied FLPMA and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR 251, the governing federal code for special use permits. 
As we know, Resolution Copper has abandoned its original plan (widely touted at first) to dispose of tailings in abandoned mine pits. At least five of these proposed disposal sites less than 15 miles away could remain in play, albeit with varying time schedules (Volume 3, Draft Practicability Analysis, p. 5). The DEIS makes no effort to expand on the idea of backfilling the Brownfield sites and basically takes a defeatist attitude and in effect says Resolution Copper does not want to do it anymore.
 Similarly, the DEIS refuses to seriously take on the issue of an alternative techniques to panel caving to mine the ore. 
The issue is dismissed in two or three pages in Volume IV, Appendix F, without facts or figures to show that another approach, while less profitable, might nonetheless be workable. 
The discussion on what is or is not reasonably justified goes to the heart of the matter. Is a pipeline that runs 20 miles reasonably incident when a shorter underground conveyor to the Pinto Valley Mine, as originally proposed, might still be possible? If Resolution Copper thought it was a good plan 15 years ago, have the company since approached Capstone to try to work out some arrangement or perhaps even purchase the mine? Is a delay in the start time of the Resolution Copper mine possible until a mine pit is available? While these might seem to be tough hurdles, how justifiable is a 4,000 acre, 450 foot high tailings dump that will likely pollute groundwater, blow tailings dust, and threaten inundation of downstream communities in comparison? What is more reasonable from a mining plan of operations standpoint, a 2 mile wide, 1,000 foot deep subsidence area at the Oak Flat that will forever be inaccessible, or a less profitable mine due to an alternative mining technique? 
The DEIS should be revised and include a thorough discussion of special use permits versus permitting under the GPO with respect to tailings pipelines, and explain its rationale for the approach it has chosen.

The BLM must have a decision making role, given the difference between regulations between the Forest Service and the BLM. At a minimum, the DEIS cannot simply refuse to discuss the BLM’s role in reviewing Alternative 5 just because it is not currently the proposed or preferred alternative.

"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","Reclamation Financial Assurance 
NEPA Section 102 (C) requires all agencies of the Federal Government to include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on: (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action ... For the purpose of this discussion focus on the words “ major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment ”. Although NEPA does not define “ the human environment ” it is clear that it is more than, but includes, the natural environment. NEPA directly addresses economic considerations a number of times, so it can be argued that economic considerations, which are clearly addressed in most EISs in the context of jobs, taxes, and community impacts. If a financial surety is required by law, which is required in Arizona, the EIS should also consider the potential economic impacts on the mining company of obtaining a financial surety for closure and/or a catastrophic failure, as well as the potential impacts to the public should the financial surety be absent, or inadequate. A financial surety for mine closure, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance, today typically runs in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. If perpetual water treatment is required, then the financial surety required typically doubles. If a company goes bankrupt during or after mining, the financial surety must be adequate to close the mine and perform post-closure monitoring and maintenance. If the financial surety is not adequate, then the public must either provide this money, or suffer the environmental damage associated with leaving the mine in its then-existing state. It is not atypical that hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake with a closure financial surety. This is clearly a potential impact on the economic and/or natural human environment, and should be disclosed/evaluated in a project EIS, as National Environmental Policy Act (42 USC § 4332) dictates. However, in the DEIS (2019) it is stated: “The cost estimates for the reclamation financial assurances are based on the final design of the facility, would be developed after the NEPA process, and would not be finalized until the final GPO is approved.” This is a failure to analyze a very significant potential impact to the public. In addition, it also means the public will have limited, or no, opportunity to comment on the size or adequacy of the financial surety.

"3.6.05","Air Quality: General","3.6","Section 3.6 - Air Quality","Wind Speeds 
Some measures to control dust due to operations have been described in the DEIS but the dust hazard due to high winds during and after mining operations has not been commented on by the USFS and no responsibility is established for dust control after mine closure. Although the tailings piles would be covered, the summer winds, and especially those preceding storms, will certainly whip up dust from the tailings dump. Heavy summer rains will eventually cause gullying of waste piles, a process which will continually expose fresh dust to the wind, and also contribute sediment , some of which could be acidic, to the water course. Plant and other work sites, laid bare by mining operations, will also become a source of dust after mine closure. The USFS needs to reassess the overall dust problem using wind speed measurements appropriate to each situation.

The DEIS must address employee safety. the DEIS says absolutely nothing about methods that will be used to prevent the occurrence of air blast. Air blasts are well known as a hazard in block caving. The air blast and associated fatalities that occurred at the Northparkes Mine in Australia in November 1999 led to a number of lessons learned, recommendations, and procedures to help prevent air blast. Precautions, such as air gap monitoring and control, that must be followed to help prevent air blast, are well known and documented, for example, in the “Cave Mining Handbook.” There is no apparent reason for the TNF to have completely ignored the subject of air blast in the DEIS. Considering the size of the proposed mine, air blast prevention must be a major consideration. A new or supplemental DEIS must include air blast effects as a possible environmental impact, and that mandatory procedures to help prevent air blast must be specified in the DEIS as a mitigation. The new DEIS should also address in using the block cave method, what will prevent vacuum pockets from developing in the orebody, thereby collapsing and creating concussion cave ins? What measures will be taken to ensure the safety of miners?

"3.10.07","Public Health and Safety: Impacts from Pipelines","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","Pipeline Safety, Maintenance, and Replacement 
DEIS Section 3.10.1.1 makes a serious mistake in equating petroleum pipelines with concentrate and tailings pipelines envisioned in the DEIS. The DEIS says: 
“The concentrate and tailings pipelines are also potentially susceptible to failure. Failures can occur from pipe damage due to geotechnical hazards such as rockslides or ground subsidence, from hydrological hazards such as scour or erosion, seismic hazards, human interference, or even lightning. Failure of these types of pipelines are not generally tracked.”
 While listing a good sample of external threats to concentrate and tailings pipelines, the DEIS fails entirely to account for internal causes of pipeline failure. Copper concentrate slurry and tailings slurry is essentially liquid sandpaper and all concentrate and tailings pipelines will need repair and replacement due to interior erosion, especially in pipeline bends and turns. While the HDPE plastic lining envisioned for these pipeline may retard the caustic or acidic effects of the slurried material, it will not withstand the abrasion of the slurry itself. While Resolution Copper may use chemical lubricants to lower abrasion of the HDPE liner, this would only slow the eventual need to repair and replace the pipeline. The amount of abrasion caused by the concentrate of tailings slurry is controlled by how coarse the material is, how fast it is moving, and how much pressure is in the line. The more pressure, the bigger the blowout. It is inconceivable that the authors of the DEIS could not find figures of concentrate and tailings pipelines. Members of the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition (who supplied much of the information in this section and collectively have many dozens of years working in miners, including working on pipeline repairs and replacement crews) can among themselves point to many instances of pipeline failure just at the facilities they worked. The DEIS is wrong to have so seriously discounted the problem of pipeline failure. As copper concentrate is a terribly toxic material, the safety measures for stopping concentrate pipeline leaks or breaks need to be substantially strengthened and revised. A copper concentrate pipeline failure would be problematic for the environment at any place, but especially when the pipeline crossed riparian areas.”

"IA01","Issues Analysis: Proposed New Issue","IA","Issues Analysis","  Perpetual water treatment and other liabilities
 Resolution Copper, if ever built, could become the largest copper producer in the United States and one of the largest in the world. The volumes of water needed are staggering, and so is the volume of potentially acid generating tailings and waste rock. The DEIS describes various methods of tailings disposal (segregating PAG and NPAG) and mentions rough timelines for tailings dewatering, yet makes no mention whatsoever of a timeline by which the mine, as a whole, could be considered stable and no longer require perpetual care. This is one of the biggest flaws of the entire DEIS; indeed, readers of it would not normally think of any of the alternatives as requiring care 1000, 2000, or even 10,000 years into the future, but this seems to be an inevitable reality under the current plan and alternatives. 
At a minimum, the DEIS should have included detailed summaries for each alternative regarding the expected timeline until no care would be required. Water treatment liabilities would be the largest component of this, but it would also relate to erosion control and vegetative cover to the extent possible. 
For water liabilities, the DEIS should have covered these items for each alternative: 
1. After the end of production, what are the expected volumes of tailings seepage and any other effluent source requiring water treatment over time, modeled out to 5,000 years? 
2. Using data from #1, calculate the approximate cost per year of maintaining such ongoing treatment using today’s costs for the technology, material inputs (such as lime) and energy requirements. Provide the methodology and background data and citations that supported this calculation. 
3. Provide an assessment of the availability to energy and material inputs required to run these operations in perpetuity.
 4. For ongoing consumptive water uses, namely dust suppression, calculate the amount of water that would be required to perform these functions, and for how long. How does the balance add up between effluent requiring treatment and water requirements?

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","The Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp)—North Option, would require a centerline sand dam for the NPAG tailings, and downstream sand dam construction for PAG tailings. The NPAG embankment would contain an underdrain system comprising sand and gravel blanket and finger drains (primarily along main drainages, with some extended beneath the NPAG beach) to maintain a low saturated surface in the tailings embankment and to intercept and direct seepage from the impoundment. The PAG cells would be behind (upstream) and ultimately covered by the NPAG tailings. 
Construction Type
 This is a safer approach to tailings disposal than the upstream dam with mixed NPAG and PAG tailings proposed by Resolution Copper. Centerline/downstream-type construction may be safer in terms of both potential static and seismic failures than upstream construction. However we ask that a 3rd party risk analysis be undertaken to justify centerline over downstream construction for all proposed tailings dams.

Rio Tinto standards and procedures require all its mines to conduct tailings and waste storage facility site risk assessments including risk hazard severity and tailings facility failure inundation zone identification and responses. Rio Tinto requires its mines to comply with its “D5 “Standard…” and “Group Procedure for the Management of Tailings and Water Storage Facilities,” among other mandatory guidelines. Rio Tinto’s “D5 Standard for Management of Tailings and Water Storage Facilities” approved August 2015 (Document HSEC-B-23) is cited in the Resolution DEIS at https://resolutioncopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/D05.-Management-of-tailings-and-wa ter-facilities2015.pdf . 
The more recently approved, currently applicable “D5 Group Procedures for Management of Tailings and Water Storage Facilities”, Approved March 2017 (Document HSEC-C- 14) is currently posted at https://www.riotinto.com/documents/RT_Management_tailings_water_storage_procedure.pdf . 
Among many other tailings facilities requirements identified in Rio Tinto mandatory tailings management standards and guidelines are a requirement for an Emergency Response Plan that, per pp. 15-16 of the Group Procedure, “must include:” 
 ●  “Response plans to triggers identified in the OMM manual related to uncontrolled release of tailings and/or water based on site observations (excessive seepage, cracking, settlement, loss of free board etc.) or an extreme event (large rainfall/flood event, large earthquake event etc.) 
 ●  Inundation map that identifies people, property, infrastructure and environment values at risk from a failure of the facility. The inundation map must be determined by a dam break analysis carried out by the Design Engineer, 
 ●  Sequence of response, notifications, role specifications and responsibilities of responders, both at site and in corporate Rio Tinto, 
 ●  A schedule of resources, mobile equipment, stockpiled materials, local contractors available to respond to an emergency, 
 ●  A community and government notification process with contact information. These must include local residents in the inundation area, police and emergency services, government agencies and departments with control over mining, environment and emergency services.”
 Projected tailings failure inundation zone typically affect lands and stream systems downgradient of tailings and waste disposal facilities, resulting projected impacts outside the disposal sites. 
The Resolution Copper DEIS does not identify tailings facility risk assessments, dam hazard ratings, failure mode analyses or inundation zone identification for potential tailings dam failures. These analyses, required by Rio Tinto procedures should be provided to stakeholders for review and analysis prior to the publication of a revised or supplemental DEIS or Final EIS.

"3.10.02","Public Health and Safety: Risk to Life and Property; FMEA (failure mode effects analysis)","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety"," At this point, it is appropriate to ask how quickly the local population centers could be overrun by mine tailings following the failure of a tailings dam. There have not been many measurements of the velocities of tailings flow slides, but they have ranged from 20-160 km/h (12-100 mph) (Jeyapalan, 1981). (The lower limit of 20 km/h apparently accounts for the equivalence between 10 km and 30 minutes in the Brazilian legislation.) According to Petley (2019), the tailings flow slide following the recent failure of the dam at the Córrego do Feijão Mine accelerated to 120 km/h (75 mph) and then slowed to 66 km/h (41 mph). Using the most conservative value of 12 mph and the above minimum distances between local population centers and tailings storage facilities, the tailings flood would arrive at Superior in 2.4 minutes, at Dripping Springs in 16 minutes, at Queen Valley in 18 minutes, and at Florence in 51.5 minutes. 
It should now be abundantly clear that, due to the probable loss of human life that would result from failure of the tailings dams, the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE), and not the 5000-year earthquake, is the appropriate design criterion for the proposed tailings storage facilities. The only remaining question is the additional cost of construction and operation of the facilities that would be necessary to accommodate the strengthened safety standard. The higher safety standard is not a minor change. Based on calculations presented in Table 3 of Appendix I in Resolution Copper Mining (2014c), at the Near West site, the predicted acceleration that would result from a 10,000-year earthquake is considerably greater (factor of 1.16-1.34 over the range 0.01-10 seconds for periodicity of seismic shaking) than what would result from a 5000-year earthquake (see Fig. Emerman, “At the Near West Site”) In fact, the predicted accelerations show no signs of approaching an asymptotic limit as the earthquake return period is increased from 100 years to 10,000 years (see Fig. Emerman, “At the Near West Site”) [see letter submittal pgs 236-238 for additional detail]

"NS02","Non-Substantive: General Opposition","NS","Non-Substantive","The ITAA and its parallel organization, the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (ITCA), have taken a position in opposition to Resolution Copper’s mine proposal and the various versions of the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act legislation since at least 2009. The potential acquisition by Resolution Copper Mine (RCM) of approximately 2,400 acres of public land near Superior, Arizona commonly known as “Oak Flat” for the development of a large scale and highly destructive copper mine is an ongoing matter of serious concern to many of our Member Tribes, since Oak Flat is a culturally and historically significant place to certain Western Apache, including members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, as well as members of the Yavapai and other Tribal cultures in the region. Over the years, ITAA and a significant number of ITAA Member Tribes have repeatedly passed formal resolutions, written letters, and testified before Congress opposing the land exchange and the proposed mine. 
The Land Exchange has also been opposed by many hundreds of tribal nations, Native organizations, and others across the United States, including as recently as last month, when the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) passed Resolution #ABQ-19-062 on October 20, 2019 titled “Support for the Protection of Oak Flat and Other Native American Sacred Spaces from Harm” (attached).

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","USDA NEPA regulations, 7 CFR Part 3407, provide for an objection period upon publication of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD). However, §3003(c)(10) of P.L. 113-291 diverts from the typical process, stating that “No later than 60 days after the date of publication of the final environmental impact statement, the Secretary shall convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Federal land to Resolution Copper.” The “Dear Reader” letter dated August 1, 2019 posted on the TNF website and enclosed with the DEIS states that although the ROD will be subject to an administrative review/objection process, “[t]he Land Exchange will be fully executed no later than 60 days after the release of the Final EIS” which is anticipated in summer 2020. Since the language permits that full execution of the Land Exchange may occur immediately upon release of the Final EIS (FEIS) (absent a court ordered injunction), Congress appears to have limited the normal objection process required by NEPA by providing for the exchange and thereby imposing irreparable harm occasioned by the transfer of this sacred site to private hands for mining purposes before the normal time frame and public process is completed under NEPA and before full remedies for any violation of NEPA can be pursued. "
"NP09","NEPA: Tribal Consultation","NP","NEPA Process"," In another deviation from the norm, Section 3003(c)(3) provides for additional consultation requirements with Indian tribes which supplement (not supplant) the existing consultation requirements under NEPA, NHPA, and other applicable law: 
(3) CONSULTATION WITH INDIAN TRIBES. – 
(A) IN GENERAL. – The Secretary shall engage in government-togovernment consultation with affected Indian tribes concerning issues of concern to the affected Indian tribes related to the land exchange.
 (B) IMPLEMENTATION. – Following the consultations under paragraph (A), the Secretary shall consult with Resolution Copper and seek to find mutually acceptable measures to – 
(i) address the concerns of the affected Indian tribes; and
 (ii) minimize the adverse effects on the affected Indian tribes resulting from mining and related activities on the Federal land conveyed to Resolution Copper under this section.
 Whether or not the TNF has fully complied with this specific and supplemental consultation requirement is not discussed in the DEIS and there is no evidence that TNF has met this statutory requirement. To the extent that the draft Programmatic Agreement is intended to address the obligations under §3003(c)(3), ITAA does not concur that consultation obligations have been met, nor are the attempts to minimize adverse effects “mutually acceptable” as required by law.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," Interestingly, §3003(c)(9)(B) of P.L. 113-291 also diverges sharply from the normal NEPA process by requiring that the Secretary “shall prepare a single environmental impact statement” under NEPA which “shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine and the Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions…” ITAA has repeatedly asked the TNF to explain how this unusual provision will be implemented as part of the NEPA process in this case. We have yet to receive an answer. Nevertheless, it is ITAA’s conclusion that any ambiguities or uncertainties about how this NEPA process will be conducted should be resolved in favor of meeting all NEPA obligations in full, as required by law.3 [Footnote: Throughout these Comments, all references to NEPA or to violations of NEPA intrinsically include but are not limited to: Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., and accompanying implementing agency regulations; 40 C.F.R. Parts 1500- 1518 (CEQ Implementing Regulations); 36 C.F.R. Part 220 (USFS Implementing Regulations); and 32 C.F.R. Part 651 (Army Corps Implementing Regulations).] "
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","because under the Act there is only a single NEPA document that can be used for the entire project – meaning that the Act does not allow any other meaningful opportunity for additional stakeholder comment prior to execution of the land exchange or conduct of mining activities – the Forest Service’s obligations (and those of the Army Corps of Engineers) to prepare a complete NEPA document in the instant DEIS are significantly higher than under a normal NEPA process (where, for example stakeholder comments on the EIS and ROD may be considered, and supplemental NEPA documents could be prepared to correct shortcomings). 
Accordingly, in this instance, it is crucial that all components of the General Plan of Operations and its related processes, and all scientific and other studies, must be completed and included in the current DEIS and not punted until a later point in time. Therefore, suggestions by the TNF that new components or considerations related to the mine can await the preparation of final EIS and ROD or future special use permit process (as has been alluded to in many instances in the DEIS) are improper and unlawful. 
The specific Congressional mandate at §3003(c)(9)(B) that “the Secretary shall prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)” applies to three different categories of federal actions. FIRST, Congress has stated that the single EIS “shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine.” SECOND, that the single EIS “shall be used as the basis for […] the Resolution mine plan of operations.” And THIRD, that this very same single EIS “shall be used as the basis for […] any related major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, rights-of-way, or approvals for the construction of associated power, water, transportation, processing, tailings, waste disposal, or other ancillary facilities.” §3003(c)(9)(B). 
In this regard, Congress has specifically designated each of the three above described categories of federal actions as connected actions under NEPA. Connected actions are “closely related and therefore should be discussed in the same impact statement. Actions are connected if they: (i) automatically trigger other actions which may require environmental impact statements. (ii) Cannot or will not process unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously. (iii) Are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for justification.” 40 C.F.R. Part 1508.25. 
Accordingly, Section 3003(c)(9)(B) does not permit, as the TNF suggests, the exemption of any connected action from the current EIS process. Power line construction and related substations and transmission facilities are but one example of the type of federal actions that, at the very minimum, must be considered in the current EIS under both the THIRD category of §3003(c)(9)(B) (as a major federal action) and under the FIRST category of §3003(c)(9)(B) (as a decision subject to Federal law) and as a connected action under NEPA. In addition to power infrastructure, examples of other connected actions under NEPA and § 3003 of the NDAA which are “required for the mine to be operational” and should not be simply “done later” as TNF and the Army Crops suggest, include, but are not limited to, § 401 Permit and § 404 Permit under the Federal Clean Water Act; any permitting decisions under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), Section 7 consultation required under the Endangered Species Act, necessary Air Quality Control Permits and other requirements under the federal Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act compliance, including any needed APP permitting, management of hazardous waste and other waste. TNF’s failure to abide by these requirements violates NEPA and the NDAA.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," the TNF is reminded that project segmentation is a violation of NEPA. Separation of analysis and staged approval processes for matters such as the construction of new or upgraded power transmission lines and substations outside of the scope of NEPA fails to consider the cumulative effects of those actions in light of the other mining and related actions currently under TNF consideration in the DEIS – a stark violation of NEPA. See, e.g., Thomas v. Peterson, 753 F.2d 754 (1985); see also Wetlands Action Network v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 222 F.3d 1105, 1118 (2000).

 ● Reasons for this request included, in part, woefully inadequate public notification about the DEIS release, comment period initiation, and scheduled public meetings. Pursuant to USFS Regulations, public notices “must clearly describe the action subject to notice and the nature and scope of the decisions to be made; identify the responsible official; describe when, where, and how the responsible official will provide opportunities for the public to participate in the planning process; and explain how to obtain additional information.” 36 C.F.R. § 219.16. USFS regulations also require that, “[t]he responsible official shall engage the public--including Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, individuals, and public and private organizations or entities--early and throughout the planning process as required by this part, using collaborative processes where feasible and appropriate,” and that “[t]he responsible official shall provide opportunities to the public for participating in the assessment process; developing a plan proposal, including the monitoring program; commenting on the proposal and the disclosure of its environmental impacts in accompanying National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents; and reviewing the results of monitoring information.” 36 C.F.R. § 219.4. 
 ● On August 9, 2019, the EPA listed the DEIS in the Federal Register as part of its weekly EIS receipt list only – this notice contained less than 20 total words and provided no information about the project, public meetings, or even where the public could go to access a copy of the DEIS itself. Even individuals who had registered for Forest Service or USDA notices in the Federal Register would not have received any notification about the release of this long awaited DEIS. The Forest Service itself has still failed to publish anything in the Federal Register about the DEIS release on this major project – contrary to years of prior practice.5 When asked, Tonto National Forest asserted6 that the practice of USFS publishing any ‘Notices of Availability of Draft 
● Environmental Impact Statements’ in the Federal Register had ended in 2017 – yet a quick search of the Federal Register.gov website shows that at least six have been published by the USFS since that time. 
 ● ITAA’s member tribes did not begin receiving mailed postcards from TNF regarding this comment period until almost two weeks after the start of the comment period – after almost 15 percent of the comment period had already elapsed. Additionally, public notice pursuant the “Resolution Copper Project and Land Exchange” email listserv was not delivered until August 13 – three days after the comment period began and less than 30 days before the first public hearing was scheduled to be held. 
 ● Meanwhile, on September 9, 2019, the Army Corps of Engineers released a Public Notice to collect public comments on Resolution Copper Mine’s application for a dredge-and-fill 404 permit. The deadline for that comment period was also scheduled for November 7, 2019, further stretching ITAA’s existing resources and those of other interested stakeholders for preparing and submitting comments on this project. Making matters worse, from ITAA’s review of the matter, it appears that no notice was ever received by any of ITAA’s Member Tribes from the Army Corps of Engineers regarding the initiation of their 404 comment period itself.7 To date, it appears that no Dear Tribal Leader letters were received by any of ITAA’s Member Tribes from the Army Corps, and when asked about the plans for tribal consultation on this comment period at the Tonto National Forest’s public meeting in Superior on September 10th, project officials indicated that the Corps had no plan in place for initiating tribal consultation. Also, despite having previously registered to receive public notifications via email from the Army Corps of Engineers, no email notice was ever received from the Army Corps of Engineers regarding initiation of this comment period. For these reasons, the comment period for the CWA 404 permit and the DEIS itself should be extended for at least an additional 90 days.

"NP01","NEPA: Public Comment Period","NP","NEPA Process","UNLAWFUL RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC PARTICIPATION  In addition to these inadequate deliveries of public notice, the restrictions placed on the submission options for public comments raises serious concerns about the adequacy of public participation under this process and of potential violations of procedural due process. USFS regulations at 36 C.F.R. § 219.4 state: 
 “When developing opportunities for public participation, the responsible official shall take into account the discrete and diverse roles, jurisdictions, responsibilities, and skills of interested and affected parties; the accessibility of the process, opportunities, and information; and the cost, time, and available staffing. The responsible official should be proactive and use contemporary tools, such as the Internet, to engage the public, and should share information in an open way with interested parties. (emphasis added).” 

 Here, the requirements set for in 36 C.F.R. § 218.8(b) for filing prohibits the incorporation of documents by reference, “except for the following list of items8 that may be referenced by including date, page, and section of the cited document, along with a description of its content and applicability to the objection. All other documents must be included with the objection.” (emphasis added). This requirement, when combined with the arbitrarily small file size (20 MB) accepted by the online portal provided to upload and submit comments, effectively bars the electronic submission of comments due to the extensive nature of all documents that must be included and, consequently large file sizes that exceed 20 MB. Because electronic submission is the most convenient submission method, these requirements make the public participation process less accessible, which violates USFS’s regulations at 36 C.F.R. § 219.4. 

Additionally, these submission requirements have the greatest impact on less technically sophisticated public participants who may be unaware that their comments may not be considered due to failure to comply with technical USFS regulations. 9 These participants will often fall into the categories that the USFS regulations specifically direct the agency to engage, such as “[y]outh, low-income, and minority populations,” and “private landowners whose lands are in, adjacent to, or otherwise affected by, or whose actions may impact, future management actions in the plan area.” 36 C.F.R. § 219.4(a)(1). In light of these serious deficiencies in the public participation process, the DEIS comment period should be extended to 180 days, the restrictions on comment submission corrected, and additional public meetings should be held in the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. Anything less violates NEPA.
 
[Footnotes: 8 This list consists of (1) All or any part of a Federal law or regulation; (2) Forest Service directives and land management plans; (3) Documents referenced by the Forest Service in the proposed project EA or EIS that is subject to objection, and (4) Comments previously provided to the Forest Service by the objector during public involvement opportunities for the proposed project where written comments were requested by the responsible official. 36 C.F.R. § 218.8(b). 9 During the scoping period in 2016, an email address was provided for submitting comments. However, an email address is not provided for commenting on the DEIS, further restricting the available methods for public participation, contrary to the requirements contemplated at 36 C.F.R. § 219.4. TNF’s decision to refuse to provide an email address for comments eliminates the opportunity to comment via one of the most commonly available communication methods in the contemporary era. Moreover, we are concerned that individuals who previously commented using the then existing USFS email address may find out too late that this option is no longer available or they may submit comments to this email address and, absent a bounce-back, may never know that their comments were not received by TNF, further violating 36 C.F.R. §219.4.]

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","RESOLUTION COPPER HAS NOT OBTAINED A § 401 CERTIFICATION.
 As a precondition to issuance of a § 404 permit, an applicant must provide the Army Corps with a § 401 certification. 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a) states, “[a]ny applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct any activity including, but not limited to, the construction or operation of facilities, which may result in any discharge into the navigable waters, shall provide the licensing or permitting agency a certification from the State in which the discharge originates or will originate…” Id. This certification, made by the state in which the discharge originates, declares that the discharge will comply with applicable provisions of the CWA, including state water quality standards. This certification is also required pursuant to the Army Corps’ Guidelines at 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(b)(1).

 In the “Mitigation and Monitoring Required by Other Regulatory and Permitting Agencies,” section of the DEIS, Resolution Copper states that is has not yet obtained a Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification: “Some of the other permits, licenses, and authorizations that would be required for the mine to be operational (and may include additional mitigations in addition to those noted here) include…Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification.” (DEIS at J-24). Therefore, as a matter of law, the Army Corps must deny Resolution Copper’s application for a § 404 permit. 
On March 16, 2016, Resolution Copper submitted “Resolution Copper Mining, LLC Baseline Hydrologic and Geotechnical Data Gathering Activities on Tonto National Forest - Application for Certification under the Clean Water Action Section 401.” Per Page 1 of the Application Supplement (materials received from ADEQ via public records request), this application is only for data gathering activities at potential tailings storage site “north and west of the town of Superior in Pinal County,” describing the rejected Alternative 2 tailings site only. Furthermore, via email sent from ADEQ on May 9, 2016: “On April 25, 2016 Resolution Copper withdrew their application for the CWA 401 certification therefore ADEQ will not be issuing a certification on this project.” To the best of our knowledge, this application has never been resubmitted, and no other CWA 401 application has been submitted by Resolution Copper to date.

"NP09","NEPA: Tribal Consultation","NP","NEPA Process"," Government-to-government consultation by the U.S. Army Corps is required by, among other things, the six USACE Tribal Policy Principles, (dated February 18, 1998), as affirmed by the Memorandum for Commanders, Directors, and Chiefs of Separate Offices, HQ USACE (dated May 10, 2010), and as affirmed by the current U.S. Army Corps Tribal Consultation Policy (dated November 1, 2012). This consultation responsibility is also affirmed by Executive Order No. 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments dated November 6, 2000, which requires all agencies, bureaus, and offices within the Federal Government to establish regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have tribal implications), and Presidential Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Tribal Consultation dated November 5, 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 57881), which supplements Executive Order No. 13175. The permit application states that, ""[t]he Corps will act as a cooperating agency to this government-to-government consultation being led by the USFS.” However, consultation must be specific to the § 404 permit. Additionally, for the reasons discussed in Section VII(D) of these Comments, the Tribal consultation conducted by the USFS was also inadequate. "
"NP10","NEPA: 106 Consultation","NP","NEPA Process","      	In addition, federal agencies are required to consult with tribes when considering the effects of undertakings on historic properties with tribal religious and cultural significance per the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 (36 CFR 800), National Park Service Bulletin No. 38 titled Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties dated 1990 (as revised), and Executive Order 13007 dated May 24, 1996 (requiring agencies to adopt procedures to “facilitate consultation with appropriate Indian tribes” related to agency actions on Federal lands which may adversely affect sacred sites). The Army Corps Regulatory Program’s procedures for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA consist of a regulation finalized in 1990, 33 CFR Part 325 (Appendix C), guidance issued in 2005,11 and a memorandum issued in 2007.12 
The NHPA expressly authorizes the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to issue regulations implementing section 106 “in its entirety.” 54 U.S.C. § 304108(a). In addition, the NHPA requires agency procedures for compliance with section 106 to be consistent with the ACHP regulations. 54 U.S.C. § 306102(b)(5)(A). Despite this, the Corps is currently implementing procedures through Appendix C of its regulations that have not been approved by the ACHP and may not be consistent with regulations developed by the ACHP for implementing section 106 of the NHPA.13 See Comm. to Save Cleveland’s Huletts v. United States Army Corps of Eng’rs, 163 F. Supp. 2d 776, 792 (N.D. Ohio 2001) (noting that “[a]ll parties agree that there is no record of the ACHP ever approving or concurring in the Corps’ regulations”). Notably, the Army Corps Regulations at Appendix C and associated Guidance allow for the delegation of Section 6 consultation to third parties; however, this is inconsistent with the implementing regulations of the ACHP. The Army Corps cannot meet its consultation obligation pursuant to § 106 while these unlawful inconsistencies are being implemented. 
Further, the permit application recognizes that, “the Project will adversely impact cultural resources that are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places,” and asserts that “Consultation between USFS, Native American Tribes, and the State Historic Preservation officer is currently occurring with respect to cultural resources impacts associated with this project.” It also states that, “Native American Tribes have also been consulted regarding the presence of any traditional cultural properties that could potentially be affected by this project."" This is the only information that Resolution Copper’s permit application provides regarding consultation, and it does not even reference the NHPA. For a full discussion of the significant shortcomings of the tribal consultation process, see Section VII(D) of these Comments. The Programmatic Agreement, which Resolution Copper is solely relying on to fulfill its consultation obligations, has yet to be finalized.

"APPC","Appendix C- CWA Alternatives Analysis","APP","Appendices","The Corps has Failed to Show the Proposed Project is the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a)). Under the Guidelines, the Corps must deny a Section 404 permit “if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.” 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a). An alternative is practicable “if it is available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purpose.” 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a)(2). Practicable alternatives include activities and discharges which do not involve discharge of dredged/fill material into waters of the U.S. 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a)(1). The Practicability Analysis in Support of Clean Water Act 404(B)(1) Alternatives Analysis is included as Appendix C of the DEIS.

It states, “[o]nce finalized, the Corps will use this practicability analysis to complete its 404(b)(1) alternatives analysis, which will be used in the Corps permitting decisionmaking process.” (p. 2). A full analysis should have been completed for inclusion in the DEIS for public comment, especially given the mandate (discussed in detail above) that this DEIS serves as the sole basis for all decisions under Federal law. The analysis of alternatives in Appendix C and in other sections of the DEIS is inadequate.

"NP11","NEPA: ESA 7 Consultation","NP","NEPA Process","Resolution Copper has failed to engage in Section 7 Consultation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (40 C.F.R. § 230.10(b)(3)). 
The Army Corp’s 404(b)(1) Guidelines prohibit the discharge of dredged or fill material if the discharge, “[j]eopardizes the continued existence of species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended,” or “results in likelihood of the destruction or adverse modification of a habitat which is determined by the Secretary of Interior or Commerce, as appropriate, to be a critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.” 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(b)(3). Pursuant to this section of the Guidelines, the permit application Public Notice states that consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is required ""at this time."" Pub. Notice/Application No.: SPL-2016-00547-MWL at 4. It is clear that Section 7 consultation is required as a pre-condition to issuance of a § 404 permit. 
Despite this clear requirement, Resolution Copper proceeded with submitting a § 404 permit application before it even initiated Section 7 consultation. The DEIS states that, ""[t]he Tonto National Forest will begin consultation with the [Fish and Wildlife Service] regarding species protected under Section 7 of the ESA once a preferred alternative is identified.” (Section 3.17.2.38 DEIS). Thus, it appears that Section 7 consultation has not yet occurred, and therefore the Army Corps must deny the § 404 permit application at this time.

(1) Significantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on human health or welfare, including but not limited to effects on municipal water supplies, plankton, fish, shellfish, wildlife, and special aquatic sites.
 (2) Significantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on life stages of aquatic life and other wildlife dependent on aquatic ecosystems, including the transfer, concentration, and spread of pollutants or their byproducts outside of the disposal site through biological, physical, and chemical processes; 
(3) Significantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on aquatic ecosystem diversity, productivity, and stability. Such effects may include, but are not limited to, loss of fish and wildlife habitat or loss of the capacity of a wetland to assimilate nutrients, purify water, or reduce wave energy; or 
(4) Significantly adverse effects of discharge of pollutants on recreational, aesthetic, and economic values. Id.
 Moreover, the Corps is required to analyze secondary effects, defined by the Guidelines as “effects on the aquatic ecosystem that are associated with the discharge of dredged or fill materials, but do not result from the actual placement of the dredged or fill material.” 40 C.F.R. § 230.11(h).

"APPD","Appendix D- CWWA Mitigation Plan","APP","Appendices"," The Proposed Project Fails to Take Appropriate and Practicable Steps to Avoid, Minimize, and Compensate Potential Adverse Effects (40 C.F.R. § 230.10(d)).

Pursuant to the 404(b)(1) Guidelines, “the district engineer may determine that a permit cannot be issued because of the lack of appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation options.” 33 C.F.R. § 332.1(c)(3). The 1990 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between EPA and the Corps14 established a three-part process, known as the mitigation sequence, to help guide mitigation decisions and determine the type and level of mitigation required under Clean Water Act Section 404 regulations: 
 Step 1. Avoid - Adverse impacts to aquatic resources are to be avoided and no discharge shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative with less adverse impact. 
Step 2. Minimize - If impacts cannot be avoided, appropriate and practicable steps to minimize adverse impacts must be taken. 
Step 3. Compensate - Appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation is required for unavoidable adverse impacts which remain. The amount and quality of compensatory mitigation may not substitute for avoiding and minimizing impacts. Id.        	With regard to Step 3, the Army Corps published the Final 2015 Regional Compensatory Mitigation and Monitoring Guidelines to standardize mitigation requirements. These Guidelines require the Corps to use a watershed plan or watershed approach to develop compensatory mitigation: 
“The ultimate goal of the watershed approach is to maintain and improve the quality and quantity of aquatic resources within watersheds through strategic selection of compensatory mitigation sites. It is expected that the use of a watershed approach will result in ecologically successful compensatory mitigation that more effectively offsets losses of aquatic resource functions and services. In undertaking the watershed approach, the Corps will consider watershed needs and how the location of compensatory mitigation sites would address those needs. The type of aquatic resource proposed for compensatory mitigation should be ecologically suitable to the location and complement the diversity (including spatial distribution) of aquatic resources in a project watershed (or alternatively: ecoregion, physiographic province, or other geographic area of interest). These considerations will include evaluation of the appropriate size watershed (e.g. Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 8 versus HUC 10 or 12 subdivisions, or the use of topographic watersheds) depending on the project size, type, and level of project impacts. (p. 11-12).”

 Further, the Army Corps is required to adhere to the following preference hierarchy for compensatory mitigation: (1) mitigation banks, (2) in-lieu fee programs, and (3) permitteeresponsible mitigation in consideration of a watershed approach. (p. 11). 
The proposed mitigation and description of the steps required by the above regulations is woefully inadequate. For the “Avoidance/Minimization” step, only a few paragraphs of information are provided between the permit application and a short section in the Conceptual Compensatory Mitigation Plan, included as Appendix D to the DEIS. In order for this aspect of the analysis required pursuant to 33 C.F.R. § 332.1(c)(3) to be sufficient, significantly more information about the project is required. As part of its review of the permit application, the Corps should fully describe all the construction and design best management practices for all of the project’s components and how these practices and designs minimize impacts. Although the Compensatory Mitigation Plan states that “an exhaustive evaluation of TSF alternatives was completed by the USFS and cooperating agencies, including the Corps,” this evaluation should be done specifically for the project components implicated by the § 404 permit application. See Section VII(C) of these Comments for a full discussion of why the DEIS evaluation of alternatives is inadequate.
 In addition, the Conceptual Compensatory Mitigation Plan is deficient for the following reasons: 
 On page 5, the Plan begins laying out the ten steps of the Mitigation Ratio-Setting Checklist (MRSC). However, it only lays out two steps. Full analysis of all ten steps is required pursuant to the South Pacific Division’s Standard Operating Procedure for the Determination of Mitigation Ratios.15 
 For the analysis of Step 2 on page 5, the full evaluation of the eleven functions identified in Table 1 should be published and available for public comment with the DEIS. This section of the analysis is thus incomplete. Further, factors from the list of assessed functions such as “Presence of Fish Habitat and Structure” should not be removed unless a full analysis is provided to demonstrate that there is no fish habitat at a particular ephemeral aquatic riparian habitat. 
The Plan does not discuss whether the Army Corps utilized a watershed plan or watershed approach, one of which is required. 
 The plan does not include any analysis discussing how the five Mitigation Opportunities were selected, or an analysis of how the required preference hierarchy was adhered to. This analysis must be included in the permit application in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation.
 The Plan states that the “details of the site-protection instruments to be recorded at these mitigation sites have not been finalized at this time.” (p. 20-21). The long-term site protection instruments must be finalized as part of the permit application.
 Further, the Conceptual Compensatory Mitigation Plan emphasizes that “[t]he aquatic resources at all of the TSF alternatives carried forward for evaluation in the DEIS and the practicability analysis are comprised almost entirely of ephemeral washes.” Conceptual Compensatory Mitigation Plan at 4. However, ephemeral aquatic resources are crucial to the ecological health of arid environments and require analysis and protection that is as stringent as that provided for perennial waters.16

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","THE 404 PERMIT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. 
The Public Interest Review is crucial to examining the cumulative impacts of a proposed permit. 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1). The public interest review is based on a range of factors, calling for the weighing of proposed impacts against the potential benefits of the proposed activity. The Corps issues a permit only if it concludes that the project is in the public interest. Id. The public interest review is a balancing test of factors that impact the cumulative effects, which may include “conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.” Id. § (a)(1). Under 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(2), the Corps must include the following factors in its public interest analysis: 
(i) The relative extent of the public and private need for the proposed structure or work; 
(ii) Where there are unresolved conflicts as to resource use, the practicability of using reasonable alternative locations and methods to accomplish the objective of the proposed structure or work; and 
(iii) The extent and permanence of the beneficial and/or detrimental effects which the proposed structure or work is likely to have on the public and private uses to which the area is suited. 
Here, the Army Corps states in Resolution Copper’s Permit Application Public Notice that it has not yet conducted a public interest review, but rather, is currently “soliciting comments from the public; Federal, state, and local agencies and officials; Indian tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.” Pub. Notice/Application No.: SPL-2016-00547-MWL at 3. These comments will then be used to assess the public interest factors above. Because the Army Corps has not yet initiated the public interest review as required by 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1), it may not issue a § 404 permit. The ITAA officially requests an opportunity to review the Army Corps draft Public Interest Determination once it is complete, before a final permit determination is made. Again, §3003(c)(9)(B) of P.L. 113-291 requires, in part, that the single EIS “shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine.” The decision by the Corp to punt this matter until a future date is not permitted by the NDAA or NEPA, among other authorities. 
The Corps regulations direct that “full consideration and appropriate weight will be given to all comments, including those of federal, state, and local agencies, and other experts on matters within their expertise.” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(3). Thus, upon consideration of the public interest factors as described below, based on the ITAA’s experience based on more than a decade of being engaged in the public debate over the proposed Resolution Copper Mine Project and its expertise advocating for Tribal governments in the state of Arizona, it is ITAA’s opinion that the proposed Resolution Copper Mine Project is contrary to the public interest and should not be permitted. 
The project would result in massive, irreversible, and negative impacts on the environment, surrounding community, religious, cultural, traditional and spiritual practices of the affected member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other ITAA Member Tribes. The basis of this project is the privatization of federal public land in order to make a profit for an international corporation at the expense of the health and welfare of the local environment and communities and the religious freedoms of Native American Tribes. No mitigation measures or permit conditions can be sufficiently implemented to lessen the negative impacts of the proposed Resolution Copper Mine in order to warrant a finding that the project would be in the public interest. Therefore, Resolution Copper’s permit application must be denied. For additional discussion of factors considered in the public interest review, see the Effects Analysis section of these Comments at VII(E), which are fully incorporated here by reference.

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","     	THE 404 PERMIT MUST BE DENIED FOR LACK OF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION AND PUBLIC NOTICE.
 One of the fundamental congressional goals and policy in enacting the CWA is to ensure full public participation in Corps and EPA permitting decisions: “Public participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of any regulation, standard, effluent limitation, plan, or program ... shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the Administrator and the States.” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(e). In line with Congress’ goals and policy, the Corps’ regulations require that all proposed discharges be subject to “public review and comment.” 33 C.F.R. §§ 325.2(a) & (d); 33 C.F.R. § 325.3; 33 C.F.R. § 332.4(b) (public review and comment on compensatory mitigation plans). “Public notice is the primary method of advising interested parties of the proposed activity for which a permit is sought, and of soliciting comments and information necessary to evaluate the probable impact on the public interest. The notice must, therefore, include sufficient information to give a clear understanding of the nature and magnitude of the activity to generate meaningful comment.” 33 C.F.R. §325.3(a) (emphasis added). 
Consistent with this Congressional intent, the 404(b)(1) Guidelines prohibit issuance of a permit where “[t]here does not exist sufficient information to make a reasonable judgment as to whether the proposed discharge will comply with these Guidelines.” 40 C.F.R. § 230.12(a)(3)(iv). In addition, under the Corps regulations, when a project is so speculative that alternatives and avoidance and minimization cannot be meaningfully addressed, the application may be considered incomplete. 33 C.F.R. § 325.3(a). Here, Resolution Copper’s permit application is missing so many key elements needed for review, the public has been effectively denied their lawful opportunity to fully consider and comment on it. Further, because the Army Corps is relying on the DEIS to satisfy its NEPA obligations and information about 404 permitting is included throughout the DEIS, the public is also being denied the opportunity to comment on a complete DEIS. 
Resolution Copper’s permit application is missing the following crucial requirements: 
Section 7 ESA Consultation pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(b)(3); 
Section 401 Certification pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a); 
Public Interest Review pursuant to 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1); 
A Complete Practicability Analysis pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a); 
A Complete Compensatory Mitigation Plan pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(d), allowing for public comment pursuant to 33 C.F.R. § 332.4(b); 
A Complete Programmatic Agreement for purposes of fulfilling federal Tribal consultation requirements; and 
A jurisdictional determination (See Practicability Analysis, DEIS Appendix C, p. 27-28 28).

The Practicability Analysis in Appendix C of the DEIS recognizes that the definition of WOTUS is uncertain. However, instead of fully assessing the impacts of these ongoing regulatory changes, the analysis instead “focuses more broadly,” (p. 28) without any detailed analysis. Without a full assessment of these regulatory uncertainties and a final jurisdictional determination, a 404 permit may not be issued. "

For reasons described herein, the DEIS in this case fails to meet nearly every single one of these criteria:
 “(a) Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.” This has not been done. See Section VII below. 
“(b) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.” This has not been done. See Section VII below. 
“(c) Include reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency.” This has not been done. See Section VII below. 
“(d) Include the alternative of no action.” Analysis of the no action alternative is dismissed nearly outright in the DEIS. See Section VII below. 
“(e) Identify the agency's preferred alternative or alternatives, if one or more exists, in the draft statement and identify such alternative in the final statement unless another law prohibits the expression of such a preference.” This basic requirement, at least, appears to have been met. 
“(f) Include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.” Discussion of mitigation measures is substantially inadequate. See Section VII(E)(8) below.

40 C.F.R. §1502.15 Affected environment requires:
“ The environmental impact statement shall succinctly describe the environment of the area(s) to be affected or created by the alternatives under consideration. The descriptions shall be no longer than is necessary to understand the effects of the alternatives. Data and analyses in a statement shall be commensurate with the importance of the impact, with less important material summarized, consolidated, or simply referenced. Agencies shall avoid useless bulk in statements and shall concentrate effort and attention on important issues. Verbose descriptions of the affected environment are themselves no measure of the adequacy of an environmental impact statement. “
The DEIS fails to meet this requirement, and a review of its contents fails to “succinctly describe” the environment to be affected or created by the alternatives. Matters raised in scoping are unaddressed, data and analysis is nowhere near the level required for this massive and unprecedent project, issues are not given full or even adequate consideration as part of baseline analysis, which separately and collectively fails to provide a complete picture of the affected environment. For example, many material issues raised during the scoping period (which had NOT been dismissed from consideration per Table G-1 of the Final Summary of Issues Identified Through Scoping Process published November 2017) are still missing from the DEIS. 
For example, critical information requested by SWCA in their preparation of this DEIS (such as details on the Drought Contingency Plan as a reasonably foreseeable action and necessary for analyzing water withdrawal impacts in Pinal County) has still been omitted from the document.18 The impacts from water use are still not meaningfully analyzed, despite having been raised during scoping. Impacts from the power infrastructure requirements are not analyzed in this DEIS, despite also having been raised during scoping and being required for consideration as a connected action under NEPA and under the unique terms of the NDAA. 
Attempts to research and understand the sources of the statements and conclusions in the DEIS by review of the cited supporting documentation (when a citation is given at all) are met with severe disappointment and frustration. As discussed herein, certain heavily relied-upon sources do not appear to even be included in the list of documentation on the project website (for example, the DEIS relies heavily on Newell & Garrett 2018d throughout the Water Resources chapter, but no such document with this citation appears to be posted on the project website). Careful review of sources cited in support of a statement in the DEIS too often reveal that those sources did not support or even mention the specific matter in that statement. In addition, attempts to navigate to and review specific points of interest within the document could not be accomplished due to the incomplete nature of the document. Conclusions on major issues of concern such as water modeling are actually incomplete (p. 363 DEIS), maps show only portions of analysis areas such as on the Desert Wellfield water model (p. 298 DEIS), key figures such as ones showing groundwater systems contain no scale depth or distance (p. 305 DEIS), along with other inexcusable failures in the document in violation of standards for the preparation of a DEIS under NEPA.

This conclusion is further supported by the appearance of unfinished editing comments throughout the DEIS such as “We are doing it. LOL.” (p. 310), as well as the existence of a completely unfinished section (DEIS p. 363) where conclusions as to the reasonableness of water models is left off mid-sentence. These things are more than just a failure to proofread the final DEIS, they reflect the gross lack of care and consideration on the part of the TNF that is normally required by NEPA and other federal laws for such an important and consequential project.

This alternative was not introduced to the public until August 2018, after the scoping period had ended and after the Scoping Report was published. The Skunk Camp tailings site is also notably absent from the 2017 Alternatives Evaluation Report. Alternative workshops and presentations through 2017 stated affirmatively that “[t]ailings disposal is proposed to take place approximately 5 miles northwest of Superior”.19 This means that public comment on this alternative (including any parties which may be impacted) was neither solicited nor received by the TNF.

"3.14.01","Tribal Values and Concerns: Ethnographic Study","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns","THE PROJECT VIOLATES THE AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT (AIRFA) AND THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT (RFRA).
 The American Indian Religious Freedom Restoration Act (AIRFA) states, “it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1996. These protections extend to the ability to access sacred sites, the use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through traditional ceremonies or rites. Id. In addition to AIRFA, Executive Order 13007 of 1996 seeks to further protect and preserve Indian religious practices. It directs agencies to “(1) accommodate access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious practitioners and (2) avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites. Where appropriate, agencies shall maintain the confidentiality of sacred sites.” Id. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) recognizes that even “laws neutral toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise,” and that “governments should not substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(a) (internal quotations omitted). There are two required elements to establish a claim under RFRA: (1) the actions alleged to be burdened by the government must be an “exercise of religion,” and, (2) the government must “substantially burden” the plaintiff’s exercise of religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). If the plaintiff successfully establishes that the government action placed a substantial burden on their exercise of religion, the burden shifts to the government to show that the burden was in the furtherance of a compelling interest and is being implemented by “the least restrictive means.” Id. at § 2000bb-1(b). In considering whether a compelling state interest justifies the substantial burden of religious exercise, the Supreme Court held “[i]t is basic that no showing merely of a rational relationship to some colorable state interest would suffice” Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406. Government interests such as the extraction of mineral resources, job creation, and economic growth are not compelling enough to justify the total and permanent destruction of Oak Flat, and with it, the religious freedoms of those tribal members whose religious practices are directly tied to this sacred place. Thus, the land exchange and the mining activities to be conducted at this place are unlawful. The current NEPA process cannot move forward until these impacts are fully assessed and avoided. The passage of the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act (National Defense Authorization Act § 3003, P.L. 113-291) places a permanent, irreparable, and substantial burden on the exercise of the sincerely held religious beliefs of the tribal members for the San Carlos Apache Tribe – one of the ITAA’s Member Tribes – who are tied to the Oak Flat area. The government cannot meet the compelling interest test and has not implemented the Act through the least restrictive means. Thus, the land exchange and mining activities authorized in the NDAA and pursuant to this NEPA process are unlawful. The Arizona tribes, including Apache and Yavapai, have lived in and used this area since time immemorial as an integral part of certain tribal religious ceremonies and actions and to gather culturally significant plants and related materials. Much of this is well documented by Arizona’s Member Tribes through their statements about this project, and in the various cultural resource surveys, ethnographic work and other documentation prepared or gathered by the TNF over the years. In short, the tribes’ religious, historical, and cultural connection to the entire Oak Flat area, including its water features, plants and animals, and other physical landmarks is indisputable. Transferring the Oak Flat area into the private ownership for mining and eventual destruction creates pressures on tribes to alter the foundation of their religious practices by ceasing access to the Oak Flat area. Without access to the land, many important religious materials only found or grown in the Oak Flat area will be erased from the religion. Once transferred, the land would become private property. Tribal members attempting to access this private property to conduct religious activities may risk criminal trespass charges. A second more severe threat would be the risks to life, health and physical safety that would come from trying to access land that that is subject to significant subsidence once the current form of mining activity (vs. other alternative mining techniques not considered in the DEIS) begins. Indeed, Resolution Copper may not be able to control or predict areas of subsidence with much accuracy. Even accessing supposed “safe” areas may still be unsafe. The DEIS fails to analyze any of these aspects of the land exchange, the proposed mine, or those potentially less destructive mining technics, relative to AIRFA and RFRA, in violation of law. 
"
"NP03","NEPA: Purpose and Need","NP","NEPA Process","     	The purpose and need statement contained in the DEIS is far too narrow to suffice as an adequate purpose and need statement for the public’s review and comment. The statement that TNF is required to “respond to parties who submit proposed plans to conduct mining operations on or otherwise use NFS lands in conjunction with mining for part or all of their planned actions” (DEIS p.ES-5) reduces the purpose and need to a description of the administrative responsibilities of that agency. Essentially, it says that the TNF is required to respond to their “inbox.” This falls far short of what is required by NEPA. The “purpose and need” section asserts a “twofold” purpose and need of the mine and the land exchange, without providing detail as to why the two connected actions are separated (DEIS p. ES-5). It is also unclear what is meant to be included or excluded by “reasonably incident” as used in the statement of “reasonably incident to extraction, transportation, and processing of copper and molybdenum.” This statement fails to describe the purpose and need of the actual proposed project in this region of Arizona. First, the DEIS needs to be redone for reasons described herein. If and when that threshold determination is made, a new purpose and need discussion should include an analysis of how the development of these mineral deposits contribute to a need for copper in the United States, particularly in light of publicly available information stating that a significant percentage of the copper concentrates will be transported out of the United States. In light of that fact, the DEIS should also discuss whether development of these copper deposits actually support “domestic mining, minerals, and metal and mineral reclamation industries” or whether they are best left in reserve for domestic use – or – whether mining is incompatible with the current existing uses of the area. "
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","       	THE DEIS IS BASED ON INCORRECT AND UNSUPPORTABLE ASSUMPTIONS AND POSITIONS REGARDING RESOLUTION COPPER’S ALLEGED ENTITLEMENT TO HAVE THIS PROJECT APPROVED UNDER THE MINING LAW. Improper Interpretation of the “No Action Alternative” The DEIS (p. ES-10) states that while the no action alternative is required by regulation, “this alternative cannot be selected by the Forest Service.” The DEIS (p. ES-10) further cites the Notice of Intent published March 2016: “The EIS will analyze the no action alternative, which would neither approve the proposed GPO nor complete the land exchange. However, the responsible official – the Forest Supervisor, Tonto National Forest – does not have the discretion to select the no action alternative.” The DEIS (p. 67) also states that “the Forest Service is unable to refuse approval of the GPO within their regulations and guidance.” Thus, the DEIS is based on the misguided belief that, since the company has filed mining claims, Resolution Copper has some inalienable right to conduct all of its mine activities. This belief is inherently inaccurate, as controlling caselaw has well-established that TNF has the authority and responsibility to regulate the use of Forest Service lands and where mining activities disturb these lands, the Forest Service may regulate the mining activities and activities incidental to mining to, among other things, prohibit unreasonable destruction of surface features and resources, including by limiting the permissible methods of mining in order to reduce environmental damage, even if this will result in increased operating costs for the mine. See Clouser v. Espy, 42 F.3d 1522, 1528-29 (9th Cir. 1994) (""there can be no doubt that the Department of Agriculture possesses statutory authority to regulate activities related to mining - even in nonwilderness areas - in order to preserve the national forests.""); see also Public Lands for the People, Inc. v. US. Dep't of Agriculture, 697 F.3d 1192, 1197-98 (2013 (9th Cir. 2012) (“The 1872 Mining Law does not strip the U.S. Forest Service of its authority to limit methods of mining or activities incidental to mining. Forest Service may prohibit the use of motor vehicles to access mining claims due to impacts on quiet recreation opportunities, wildlife, water quality, air quality and other Forest Service resources”); see also Kuruk Tribe of Cal. v US. Forest Service, 681 F.3d 1006, 1023 (9th Cir. 2012) (observing that while the 1872 Mining Law gives miners a statutory right to mine on Forest Service lands, the federal government ""retains substantial regulatory power"" over these mining activities). "
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","The DEIS Fails to Assess the Validity of Resolution Copper’s Mining Claims Additionally, despite being an express requirement (see 30 U.S.C. § 22 which states that only “valuable mineral deposits” are covered by the Mining Law; see also 30 U.S.C. § 611 which states that “common varieties” of minerals are not locatable under the Mining Law), there is no evidence in the record that any analysis has been done on whether any of Resolution Copper’s mining claims, including unpatented mining claims, are valid. See Center for Biological Diversity, 162 IBLA 268 (2004). “[T]he location of a mining claim does not render a claim preemptively valid and the Department may require a claimant to provide evidence of validity before approving an MPO or allowing other surface disturbance in connection with the claim.” Even further, project lands contain many mining claims not belonging to Resolution Copper and the DEIS (see, e.g., p. ES-22, p. 134, p. 157) notes that under Resolution Copper’s mine plans, access to those other claims “may be inhibited.” Yet no analysis appears anywhere in the DEIS discussing these other claims or reconciling issues with inhibiting access to those claims. Under the Mining Law, in order to be valid, mining claims must contain the “discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.” 30 U.S.C. § 22. The U.S. Supreme Court has endorsed at least two tests for determining whether a claim qualifies as a “valuable mineral deposit.” The “marketability test” outlined in United States v. Coleman, 390 U.S. 599, 600 (1968) requires a showing that the mineral “can be extracted, removed, and marketed at a profit.” The “prudent person test” requires a showing that the discovered deposits “must be of such a character that a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labors and means, with a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a valuable mine.” Id. at 602. The Court has held that profitability is “an important consideration in applying the prudent-man test and the marketability test” and noted that “…the prudent-man test and the marketability test are not distinct standards, but are complementary in that the latter is a refinement of the former.” Id. at 602-603. Further, the USFS Minerals Manual states that “[a] claim unsupported by a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit is invalid from the time of location, and the only rights the claimant has are those belonging to anyone to enter and prospect on National Forest lands.” Forest Service Manual (FSM) § 2811.5. The term “valid claim” is often used loosely and incorrectly to indicate only that the boxes have been checked, including posting of notice, monumentation, discovery work, recording, annual assessment work, payment of taxes, and so forth, have been met. This overlooks the basic requirement that the claimant must discover a valuable mineral deposit. Generally, a valid claim is a claim that may be patented. FSM § 2811.5. No information has been made public to date on the appraisal process required by §3003 of P.L. 113-291, despite the statement that the project apparently hinges on this very appraisal, since Resolution Copper allegedly “may or may not choose to undertake the exchange after receipt of the appraised value.” (DEIS p. 66). Information regarding this process should have been included in the DEIS. Additionally, the DEIS (p. 66) says that “It is possible that mining under the proposed action or action alternatives could also take place without the land exchange occurring.” This is a major statement and would radically change the characteristics of the entire project and would, at the very least, require the Forest Service to go back to the drawing board on all aspects of the mine and the DEIS. This would also potentially violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and the 1872 Mining Law (as amended) by not requiring Resolution Copper to pay Fair Market Value (FMV) for the use of public lands not covered by valid mining claims. 43 U.S.C. §1701(a)(9) requires that “the United States [must] receive fair market value for the use of the public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided for by statute.” "
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","No Consideration is Given to Other, Non-Mining Land Uses Similarly, the USFS position also violates provisions of FLPMA and the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act, National Forest Management Act, 1897 Organic Act, and other laws mandating that agencies manage (or at least consider managing) these lands for non-mineral uses. The USFS has refused to even consider exercising its multiple-use authority, an arbitrary and capricious decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The USFS cannot simply assume that the lands to potentially be used for tailings or other mine infrastructure are covered by valid mining claims. The U.S. Supreme Court in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) states that an agency rule “would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” The DEIS’s review and the agencies’ proposed approval of this project are based on the overriding assumption that Resolution Copper has statutory rights to use all of the lands associated with this project (including both lands which would be acquired under the exchange legislation, and lands which would remain in the public domain), under the 1872 Mining Law. However, where project lands have not been verified to contain, or do not contain such rights, the USFS’ more discretionary multiple-use authorities apply. See Mineral Policy Ctr. v. Norton, 292 F.Supp.2d 30 (D.D.C. 2003). The USFS’ multiple-use, public interest, and sustained yield mandates should have been applied to the areas of this project not covered by valid mining claims. Such analysis should have been done in this DEIS. USFS should have inquired in this DEIS as to what portions of its lands which would be used for the project (including and particularly those which would remain under federal jurisdiction after the land exchange is executed) contain “common varieties” or “valuable mineral deposits.” The USFS’ assumption of rights or entitlement by Resolution Copper should be investigated and supported by detailed factual evidence in a new DEIS. "
"AO01","Alternative Opposition: Alternative 1- No Action","AO","Alternative Opposition","The DEIS completely fails to adequately discuss potential alternative mining techniques which would not result in the permanent destruction of the land surface and which would have substantially less impact on the human environment as a whole and potentially, on the religious freedoms of affected tribal members. The DEIS merely states in conclusory fashion with no discussion or elaboration: “The Forest Service assessed alternative mining techniques in an effort to prevent subsidence, but alternative methods were considered unreasonable.” (p. ES-3). The DEIS further admits that alternative mining techniques were not even considered in detail and were “dismissed from detailed analysis” (DEIS p. 29). This is not sufficient under NEPA to support the dismissal of credible alternative mining technics that have been presented to the TNF. The DEIS notes that the “cutoff grade” by which the mine can be profitably operated informs the decision on alternative mining techniques. Table F-2 (DEIS, Appendix F, p. F-3) reveals that the sole source of data for these cutoff grade calculations is “Resolution Copper.” The TNF is wrongfully dismissing its duty to analyze alternatives based solely upon unverified data provided by Resolution Copper. It is evident that that the finding of alternative methods as “unreasonable” was not made by TNF in the first place, but rather, was made by Resolution Copper and adopted whole cloth by TNF without analysis or question. This is unacceptable. A more complete and verified explanation of the rationale for the rejection of other alternatives (not just using conclusions provided by the company) should be included in a new DEIS. Anything short of this violates NEPA. "
"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","Inadequate Baseline Analysis Under the “No Action” Alternative Analysis of the mandatory “no action” alternative in the DEIS is totally inadequate. Section 2.2.3 of the DEIS states that under the “no action” alternative, the GPO would not be approved, and none of the activities in the GPO would be implemented including no mining. At the minimum, the “no action” alternative is intended to serve “as a point of comparison for the proposed action and action alternatives” (DEIS p. 66, emphasis added). However, the DEIS lists several major ongoing actions of Resolution Copper which TNF has, essentially, baked into their environmental baseline analysis, which results in these impacts not being analyzed at any point in the current DEIS process or during the TNF’s prior consideration under NEPA of the pre-feasibility activities at Oak Flat. This includes, but is not limited to, the ongoing and “continued dewatering” of the mine shafts, including shafts No. 9 and No. 10, among other shafts and tunnels. (DEIS p. 300). Other actions and impacts that have been ignored by the TNF in the DEIS include “reclamation of the historic Magma Mine; exploration; monitoring of historic mining facilities such as tailings under existing State programs and permits; maintenance of existing shaft infrastructure, including dewatering; and water treatment and piping of treated water along the MARRCO corridor to farmers for beneficial use.” (DEIS pp. 65-66). Regarding this last point, the DEIS unfairly considers Resolution Copper’s water recharge efforts which include delivery of dewatered water to New Magma Irrigation and Drainage District as “an applicant-committed environmental protection measure” (p. 341) while failing to analyze the actual environmental impacts of that same dewatering which will occur at the mine and throughout the well corridor (p. 300). As discussed further below, this is the very definition of greenwashing, and a failure under NEPA to properly analyze environmental impacts. Because the “no action” alternative includes (and does not analyze) a huge slate of ongoing actions by Resolution Copper related to Oak Flat, including those discussed above and dewatering and other underground activities, TNF is not able to credibly conclude (as it does without support) that the project will have “no impacts from subsidence, induced seismicity, increased potential for landslides or rockfall, impacts on caves, karst, or paleontological resources, or impacts on mining claims” (DEIS p. 148); “impacts on soils, vegetation communities, special status plant species, and noxious weeds would not occur” (DEIS p. 183); “there would be no impacts on air quality from proposed mining and associated activities” (DEIS p. 282); “no perennial streams are anticipated to be impacted” (DEIS p. 317); many shallow domestic and stock water supply wells in the area are “unlikely to be impacted” (DEIS p. 325). These conclusions are also undermined by the DEIS itself, which states that since 2009, groundwater levels in the deep groundwater system within the Resolution Graben below Oak Flat have declined “more than 2,000 feet,” by “about 400 feet” outside the graben, and by “up to 50 feet” near Superior (DEIS p. 306). First, this data is partially provided by Resolution Copper and may be an underestimation – even at these levels, it is spectacularly difficult to imagine how such water level declines could not impact any of the listed resources described in the DEIS at pp.65- 66. And yet, these impacts are not adequately addressed or considered in the DEIS, particularly where TNF has allowed gradual, but significant, adverse impacts to the environment to take place as the result of, inter alia, Resolution Copper’s pre-feasibility activities at Oak Flat and related actions which have now been included in the environmental baseline in the current DEIS. These actions, which violate NEPA, essentially assure that the full scope of impacts on the human environment in relation to this project will never be meaningfully analyzed. In the absence of full analysis of ongoing actions, such impacts can’t be known and these claims in the DEIS are meaningless. This violates NEPA, among other laws and requirements. "
"3.16.01","Livestock and Grazing: General","3.16","Section 3.16 - Livestock and Grazing","In addition, grazing activity at Oak Flat by Integrity Land & Cattle Company (a subsidiary
company owned by Resolution Copper) has been ongoing for many years. As the TNF is well
aware, cattle grazing can have significant impacts on environmental sustainability, causing
erosion, loss of plant variability, downcutting, and loss of habitat, among other adverse impacts.
The DEIS failed entirely to analyze how ongoing grazing activities (particularly by Resolution
Copper subsidiary company Integrity Land & Cattle) have contributed to a degraded
environmental baseline at Oak Flat."
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS states that “[b]etween 14 and 16 GDEs, mostly sacred springs, would be anticipated to be impacted by dewatering” (DEIS p. ES-27). However, as noted above, TNF has done nothing to date to analyze or disclose the impacts of prior pre-feasibility pumping and other activities on the numerous springs that have been impacted by Resolution Copper’s pre-feasibility activities at the site that date back at least a decade. As a result, the number of springs that have been dewatered over this period of time are NOT being considered as part of the TNF’s analysis of direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts because these impacts have been, essentially, baked into the new environmental baseline through the “no action” alternative. This problem extends to the associated direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on cultural and historic resources, religious practices, as well as the monitoring or mitigation requirements for GDEs, among other matters. The requirement for the “no action” alternative exists as a mechanism for comparing the environmental and related social and economic effects of the affected environment in the absence of the proposed action, as compared to all of the proposed action alternatives. These goals have not been met. "
"CU02","Cumulative: RFFA - Reasonably Foreseeable Future Activities","CU","Cumulative","The DEIS also fails to recognize the substantial changes in the region that will occur in the near term, including ecological changes, substantial population growth and population distribution in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, a worsening drought and associated measures being taken both by the State of Arizona and the larger southwestern region on water management, changes in land use and resource use patterns. To realistically project conditions in the affected area without the proposed mine requires TNF to evaluate the aggregate of local government plans, policies, population projections, capital improvement plans and similar documents, as well as the plans for other relevant Federal, State, and local agencies. These, and all baseline conditions, should have been considered in the DEIS. "
"NP09","NEPA: Tribal Consultation","NP","NEPA Process","TRIBAL CONSULTATION HAS BEEN INADEQUATE. The specific legal responsibility of the U.S. Forest Service to engage in government-togovernment consultation with Indian Tribes is codified in the Federal regulations. Specifically, 36 C.F.R. § 219.4(a)(2) states: (2) Consultation with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations. The Department recognizes the Federal Government has certain trust responsibilities and a unique legal relationship with federally recognized Indian Tribes. The responsible official shall honor the government-to-government relationship between federally recognized Indian Tribes and the Federal Government. The responsible official shall provide to federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations the opportunity to undertake consultation consistent with Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, and 25 U.S.C. 450 note. The TNF, U.S. Army Corps, and other agencies appear to be relying nearly exclusively on a still-not-yet-executed Programmatic Agreement (PA) for their tribal consultation responsibilities developed under Section 106 of the NHPA. This was confirmed by U.S. Army Corps representatives in attendance at the September 10, 2019 public meeting in Superior, Arizona who simply referenced the PA when asked if the Corps had any plans to engage in tribal consultation on the 404 permit. New drafts of the PA are still being written even to date, and yet when asked by Tribal Leaders on October 28, 2019 to extend the comment due date to allow for additional time to review and comment upon the current draft, the TNF refused. This PA process improperly separates tribal consultation into a separate closed box, outside of the comment process and outside of analysis from the DEIS, which is improper. Analysis of project impacts and effects, plans for monitoring and mitigation to cultural resources must be considered in the DEIS as a critical component of the NEPA process (this can certainly be accomplished without disclosure of any protected sensitive information) – and yet, the TNF has made it clear that it has bifurcated this responsibility. 36 C.F.R. §800.8(a)(3) Inclusion of historic preservation issues requires agency officials to ensure that preparation of an “EIS and record of decision (ROD) includes appropriate scoping, identification of historic properties, assessment of effects upon them, and consultation leading to resolution of any adverse effects.” These requirements have not been met in the current DEIS. The draft Programmatic Agreement provided in the DEIS states: “Identification of cultural resources has yet to be completed for the Skunk Camp Tailings location (Alternative 6), pipeline routes for Alternatives 5 and 6, main 230-kilovolt power lines for the GPO and power line routes for Alternative 6 and any remaining areas not covered by earlier surveys due to project adjustments, and is scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2019.” (DEIS Appendix O, p. 10). And yet – TNF confirmed, at its public meetings on September 10, 2019 in Superior and September 12, 2019 in San Tan Valley, that these cultural resources surveys had still not yet been completed – long after the DEIS had been published for public comment. Thus, none of the findings of those surveys could have been considered in the DEIS. If only partial survey findings were considered in the DEIS, then the DEIS is incomplete. The DEIS should not have been rushed out the door without this critical information - which was not unavailable but was being prepared and was forthcoming. NEPA procedures used by agencies “must insure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b). In fact, the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) has documented serious concerns regarding the tribal consultation process. Following a meeting on August 29, 2019 (after the comment period on this DEIS had begun), the State Historic Preservation Officer Kathryn Leonard wrote a letter to TNF Supervisor Neil Bosworth reiterating SHPO’s ongoing concerns with the PA process. The full text of that letter is reproduced below and it is expressly incorporated here by ITAA: [see comment letter for pull text] Additionally, the draft PA as attached to the DEIS is also incomplete as it does not contain any of its appendices (listed at Appendix O, p. 24): A. Area of Potential Effects; B. Maps; C. Definitions; D. NAGPRA Plan; E. Key Staff Contact Information; or F. Programmatic Agreement Process. Meaningful comments cannot possibly be solicited on partially provided materials. This violates NEPA. "
"3.12.04","Cultural Resources: Traditional Cultural Properties","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","The DEIS fails to Analyze and Mitigate Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Impacts to Religious, Cultural, Traditional, Archaeological & Historic Resources As discussed in the RFRA section, supra., Chi'chil Biłdagoteel (Oak Flat), as well as Apache Leap and Gaan (Devil’s) Canyon, are sacred and holy places. As testified to by Wendsler Nosie, former chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe before the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands on November 1, 2007: 
""In our native language Oak Flat is called Chich’il Bildagoteel, and it lies in the heart of T’is Tseban country. The Oak Flat area is bounded in the east by Gan Bikoh or Crown Dancers Canyon, and in the north by Gan Diszin or Crowndancer Standing. These canyons are called “Devil’s Canyon” and “Queen Creek Canyon” by non- Indians. For as long as may be recalled, our People have come together here. We gather the acorns and plants that these lands provide, which we use for ceremonies, medicinal purposes, and for other cultural reasons. We have lived throughout these lands, and the Apache People still come together at Oak Flats and Apache Leap to conduct religious ceremonies and to pray or take rest under the shade of the ancient oak trees that grow in the area. The importance of these lands has not changed. These are holy, sacred, and consecrated lands which remain central to our identity as Apache People.20""
 As stated verbatim in our project scoping comments submitted to the Tonto National Forest on July 18, 2016 (which are attached in full and incorporated herein): “Oak Flat is a place of religious, cultural, traditional, archaeological and historic importance to certain of ITAA’s Member Tribes. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a Traditional Cultural Property under Section 106 of the NHPA and it qualifies as an “Indian sacred site” under E.O. 13007.” The fundamental importance of Oak Flat stems, in part, from its continued existence as a natural place within the natural world. Oak Flat has, for countless generations, played a crucial role in the exercise of certain Apache and Yavapai religious, traditional, and cultural practices, and these practices continue to this day. The water sources at Oak Flat, including its springs, seeps and surface water are fundamental to the integrity of Oak Flat. The oak groves at Oak Flat have always provided an abundant source of acorns that serve as an important food source. There are also hundreds of traditional plants and other living things in the Oak Flat area that are crucial to certain Tribal practices and life ways. Some of these plants are common and some are medicines known to and harvested only by qualified Tribal practitioners. While some of these plants can be gathered in other areas, only the plants within the Oak Flat area are imbued with the unique power of this sacred area. For certain Western Apache, including certain members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, Oak Flat is also the home of important Gaan (or holy spirits) that are directly associated with this place. Furthermore, Oak Flat sits in the context of the surrounding Tonto National Forest, which also contains features and sites important to a number of Tribes. Archaeological resources have been found throughout the area, while certain seeps and springs located within the footprint of one of the Alternative tailings sites have been identified to TNF as significant to Tribes.

"3.14.01","Tribal Values and Concerns: Ethnographic Study","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns","The Oak Flat area is also important habit for Bald and Golden Eagles. While the DEIS entirely failed to conduct meaningful analysis of the project impacts on Bald and Golden eagles (or with regard to mitigation as a result of such impacts) with respect to their legal obligations under BGEPA, it also wholly failed to examine the direct, indirect, and cumulative impact of the project on the cultural, religious, and traditional importance of Eagles to Tribes. Bald and Golden Eagles play a deeply rooted role in Tribal religion, traditions and culture, and indeed, in the very identity and health of Tribal people. For purposes of clarification, while ITAA Member Tribes may refer to both Bald and Golden Eagles collectively as “Eagles” or “the Eagle” in general conversation, the Tribes distinguish between the two for more specific conversation, ecological reference, and ceremonial practice. Indeed, the Tribes recognize the characteristics, qualities, ecological function, place and power specific to each Eagle. 
To further illustrate the importance of Eagles, certain populations of Eagles remain under the watch and protection of ITAA Member Tribes due to the location of Eagle nests and wintering and foraging habitat on the Member Tribes’ reservations. Certain of ITAA’s Member Tribes are also expressly charged under their Tribal Constitutions with the responsibility and authority to manage and regulate the wildlife and habitat found within their Reservations, including Eagle habitat. While each of ITAA’s Member Tribes may perceive Eagles quite differently or rely on the Bald and Golden Eagle for different aspects of their religious, traditional or cultural practices, Eagles in general are and remain important beings, whose lives are inextricably intertwined with the continued existence of all human beings on this Earth. For many of ITAA’s Member Tribes, the Eagle figures prominently in their oldest creation songs and stories, and in almost all of the ancient prayer song cycles. Indeed, many of these songs can be regularly heard today during the Tribal ceremonies that are conducted throughout the year, sung word-for-word the way they have been sung for generations. In fact, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has also recognized the importance of Eagles to the religious, traditional and cultural practices of Tribes, stating in 2009: 
""Some Tribes and tribal members may consider eagle nests sacred sites provided for in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. § 1996) (some are frequently referred to as Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs), and as potential historic properties of religious and cultural importance under the NHPA. […] In addition, some tribes may consider all eagles and eagle nests as TCPs or sacred sites, and potential historic properties of religious and cultural significance which must be considered under Section 106 of the NHPA.21"" 
The DEIS (Table 3.8.4-2, pp. 466-468) notes that hundreds of thousands of acres of Eagle habitat “potentially would be impacted under each action alternative” (referencing only the tailings alternative sites and not the mine site) but no analysis appears anywhere on how the project activities - including but not limited to dewatering and water use and transmission lines – will directly, indirectly, and cumulatively impact Eagles and Eagle habitat or the traditional, cultural or religious practices of the Tribes. This is a violation of NEPA. See 36 C.F.R. § 220.4(f).

"3.8.05","Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species: Special Status Wildlife Species","3.8","Section 3.8 - Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species","While the DEIS says that the Resolution Copper mine project, including already-ongoing activities like dewatering, will or is likely to deplete water supplies and harm or destroy the streams, springs, seeps and other water features that are needed to preserve Oak Flat and support its animals and plants, discussion and analysis of the impacts of specific direct, indirect and cumulative and impacts is woefully inadequate and mitigation plans are left undefined. The DEIS (p. ES-27) states: “Between 14 and 16 GDEs [groundwater-dependent ecosystems], mostly sacred springs, would be anticipated to be impacted by dewatering. Although mitigation would replace water, impacts would remain to the natural setting of these places.” The DEIS contains no meaningful or detailed description as to these impacts, including on species such as Eagle. "
"3.12.03","Cultural Resources: Archaeological Sites","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","For over ten (10) years, the ITAA and its Member Tribes have expressed specific, detailed concerns about the various likely and inevitable impacts of the proposed Resolution Copper Mine to the Forest Service on these specific religious, cultural, traditional, archaeological, and historical values. This has been well-documented through extensive communications and actions taken regarding this project, including Congressional testimony submitted by tribal leaders including former San Carlos Apache Tribal Chairman Wendsler Nosie and current Chairman Terry Rambler, among other tribal leaders. In addition, extensive background on the specific religious, cultural, traditional, and religious importance of the Oak Flat area was discussed in the ITAA scoping comments submitted on July 18, 2016 (attached). There have also been ethnographic studies performed for this area by TNF[22] and Oak Flat is listed as a Traditional Cultural Property under the NHPA (Chi’chil Bildagoteel Historic District, listed on April 3, 2016, NPS#16000002). 
The DEIS (p. 678) acknowledges that “Loss of the culturally important area of Oak Flat would be a substantial threat to the perpetuation of cultural traditions of the Apache and Yavapai tribes” and that “Native American communities would be disproportionately affected by the land exchange.” Still, the DEIS (p. 6) states that the Forest Service is still working “to better understand the historical, cultural, and religious importance of the [project] area.” First, this section does not contemplate any other “area” other than the land surface overlying the copper deposit although many other lands have the potential to be impacted by the project. 
Second, the draft Programmatic Agreement attached to the DEIS (p. 4) indicates that cultural resource surveys of the tailings alternatives are still ongoing, and that no cultural resource surveys have been done on the pipeline alignments. 
Third, TNF has violated NEPA by releasing the DEIS without all of this work having been done already. Federal regulations (see 36 C.F.R. § 800.8(a)(3) and §800.8(c)) require that identification of historic properties, assessment of impacts, and resolution of adverse effects through avoidance, minimization, or mitigation be completed prior to – in order to be included in – the NEPA documents. Because this work is apparently still ongoing, a full analysis of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts is missing from the DEIS (a failure which violates NEPA, among other federal laws and requirements). In the absence of this analysis, a reasoned decision cannot be made. Alternatively, if this work has already been done but has not been included or considered in this DEIS – this is also a glaring failure that violates, inter alia, NEPA.

"3.15.02","Environmental Justice: Mitigation","3.15","Section 3.15 - Environmental Justice","The DEIS (p. 686, et seq). concludes that tribes with cultural, social, or religious ties to the project area “will be affected permanently from direct, permanent impacts on these sites and values” and that these impacts “cannot be avoided or fully mitigated,” but also states that “at this time, no mitigation measures have been identified what would be solely pertinent to environmental justice.”[23] Pursuant to Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” and accompanying Guidelines,[24] federal agencies are required to consider environmental justice in their analysis under NEPA. According to the EPA, environmental justice (EJ) is defined as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies,” where fair treatment “means that means no group of people should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, governmental and commercial operations or policies.”[25] Mitigation measures with regard to EJ and the other specific topics discussed above, which are required by law to be included in the DEIS and subject to public comment, are absent from this DEIS. 
[Footnotes: 23: At 3.17.2.34, the DEIS states: “Environmental Justice There would be irretrievable socioeconomic impacts under all action alternatives because existing land uses, including recreation opportunities, would be precluded within the project area during the life of the project. All action alternatives would potentially cause irreversible impacts on the affected area with regard to changes in the local landscape, infrastructure and tax base funding, community values, and quality of life for residents of the town of Superior.” This is the only analysis regarding environmental justice that is provided by the DEIS.

"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","Finally, the TNF should have considered the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Declaration) in the NEPA process. In its Final Summary of Issues Identified Through Scoping Process published November 2017, the TNF wrongfully dismissed this issue, stating that since the United States “was not a signatory” to the Declaration, then it “must therefore be considered beyond the scope of the Forest Service decision.” In fact, on December 16, 2010, President Obama announced that the United States was reversing its negative vote on the Declaration and it now supports the Declaration in full.[26] As such, the United States, while not a “signatory”, fully supports the purposes of the Declaration and has for nearly a decade. Consideration of the Declaration was dismissed on incorrect grounds and should have been considered by TNF in preparing this DEIS. Additionally, the ACHP adopted a plan in 2013 to support the Declaration and encourages Federal agencies to utilize its contents “specifically in carrying out their Section 106 responsibilities.”[27] Article 11 of the Declaration makes clear that “...Indigenous peoples have the right to practice and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies…” Similarly, Article 12(2) calls for the United States to “…seek to enable the access and/or repatriation of ceremonial objects and human remains in their possession through fair, transparent and effective mechanisms developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned…”, while Article 25 emphasizes the right of indigenous peoples to “maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other resources…” TNF wrongfully dismissed consideration of the Declaration from scoping, and should have considered and applied the Declaration in preparation of this DEIS.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS is Radically Insufficient with Respect to Water. In ITAA’s scoping comments submitted July 18, 2016 (attached), the contents of the General Plan of Operations (GPO) (also referred to in these comments as the “Mining Plan of Operation” or “MPO”) were very carefully analyzed with regard to water. There is only a single place in the GPO, where Resolution Copper provides a number for its total water needs for the life of the mine. Specifically, Resolution Copper states, “[a] current estimate of the total quantity of water needed for the life of the mine is 500,000 ac-ft.” GPO, Volume 1, Sec. 3.6.1, Water Balance, Sources, and Management at 174. Yet, as ITAA specifically demonstrated in its scoping comments, close analysis of the Tables and Figures contained in the GPO – figures that were prepared by Resolution Copper – shows that Resolution Copper actually believes its total water usage over the life of the mine will be closer to 786,626 AF. This is more than enough water to serve over 1 million households in Phoenix for at least 3 years. A summary of these figures taken directly from the GPO is reproduced below. This figure is far more than the water usage numbers that are contained anywhere in the DEIS. Nevertheless, it appears that the TNF has failed to consider these comments as part of the DEIS process. Certainly, they have not in any way disputed the larger number of 786,626 that was arrived at by using Resolution Copper’s own tables and figures from the GPO. Instead, much like elsewhere in the DEIS, TNF appears to have generally adopted the assertions of Resolution Copper about their water usage, with little to no scrutiny or analysis. This violates among other things the “hard look” requirements of NEPA. Additionally, the TNF has done nothing in the DEIS to address the clear disconnect between Resolution Copper’s own water usage figures. In fact, the DEIS (p. ES-24) simply concludes with no analysis or support that for the life of the mine, “87,000 acre-feet of water would be pumped from the mine, and between 180,000 and 590,000 acre-feet of makeup water would be pumped from the Desert Wellfield in the East Salt River Valley.” Additionally, as noted in ITAA’s scoping comments, ITAA considers the figures from Resolution Copper’s materials to be an overly conservative estimate of the amount of water actually needed for the mine. This is demonstrated by the analysis of Dr. Steven Emerman (report attached here), who reported that water estimates for this mine are “about one-third of industry standards.” However, Industry standards are never addressed in the DEIS. These failures do not meet multiple requirements under NEPA and show that the Forest Service has no intention of taking a hard look into the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to Arizona’s water supplies from this project. Given the critical importance of water to a wideranging number of local, regional, and state interests, these failings plainly demonstrate that the TNF needs to go back to the drawing board on all water and water-related issues. Anything short of this violates NEPA. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.24 requires agencies to “insure the professional integrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussions and analyses in environmental impact statements.” See also Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, Chapter 20, §23.33. For a multitude of reasons including as discussed in this section, the DEIS is radically insufficient with regard to water including groundwater, surface water, water quality, all of the water models, direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of water usage, mitigation, and analysis of ongoing dewatering. "
"3.7.01","Water Resources: Groundwater Pumping","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS Fails to Analyze and Mitigate the Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Impacts of Water Usage. As noted above, ITAA’s July 18, 2016 scoping comments included several concerns and questions regarding the substantial water demands and use of water sources for the Resolution Copper mine project. Most if not all of those have not been included in this DEIS and are still unanswered. It is clear that TNF has done little to nothing in the DEIS to meaningfully consider Resolution Copper’s ability to develop a virtually unlimited number of wells for its project under Arizona’s groundwater laws to support the water consumption and dewatering needs of the proposed Resolution Copper mine. Unlike other users of groundwater in Arizona (i.e. industrial, agricultural, and residential) mines are essentially unregulated water users. Groundwater extraction permits for mines are “must issue.” As a result, mining companies often face little to no legal restrictions or limits on the amount of water they can pump from the aquifer. See, e.g., A.R.S. § 45-514. While it is not the obligation of the TNF to assert a view one way or another on the suitability of Arizona law in this regard, it is TNF’s obligation in the DEIS to consider potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of the project that would arise from the use of mineral extraction permits and other authorizations under state law that permit the mine to deplete (virtually unregulated) Arizona’s existing water supplies. The net effect is that, notwithstanding the representations made today, Resolution Copper can pump as much water as they want at any point in the future and as such, the DEIS must consider this in its evaluation of impacts. Although the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) has been a cooperating agency in the NEPA process, the DEIS fails entirely to contemplate the actual availability of water resources - or the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from withdrawing such large volumes of water from the various undetermined sources (groundwater, surface water, banked water, etc.). In fact, the DEIS (p. 18 and elsewhere) states that the water sources “would be” (have not yet been) determined by ADWR. This determination should have been made and included in the DEIS for full analysis of its direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts, as well as mitigation. The failure of the TNF to do this violates NEPA. The DEIS (p. 59) further states that “[r]egardless of the authority for obtaining the water, the water is pumped from the same wells.” Given this assertion, a full analysis should also have been done in this DEIS to consider impacts of the mine’s proposed water usage on Arizona’s water supplies at the local, regional, and state level, regardless of what “paper” source are legally ascribed for that water. This points were made in some detail in the ITAA scoping comments, but they are disregarded in the DEIS. Furthermore, given ADWR’s status as a cooperating agency, the DEIS should have (but completely failed to) analyze the water management actions by that agency and how those may affect and be affected by this project, including the Management Plans required under the 1980 Groundwater Code which was enacted to “aggressively manage the state’s finite groundwater resources.” 28 Under the Groundwater Code, areas of the state with “heavy reliance on mined groundwater” were designated as Active Management Areas (AMAs), and for many AMAs including the Phoenix AMA, the primary management goal is to achieve safe-yield by the year 2025. The current mine infrastructure “lies almost entirely within the Phoenix AMA” (DEIS p. 312), and the Desert Wellfield is located within “the East Salt River valley subbasin of the Phoenix AMA” (DEIS p. 18). Incredibly, no discussion or analysis is included anywhere in the DEIS on the relationship between the large amount of water proposed to be used by this project and the Phoenix AMA safe-yield goals. This is inconsistent with NEPA, which requires, at a base, a “reasonably thorough discussion of the significant aspects of probable environmental consequences.” Oregon Natural Resources Council v. Lowe, 109 F.3d 521, 526 (9th Cir. 1997). The DEIS (p. 335) states that “the amount of groundwater in storage in the East Salt River valley subbasin (above a depth of 1,000 feet) is estimated to be about 8.1 million acre-feet.” The amount of water in storage (meaning in water storage facilities) is NOT the same thing as the amount of water which actually exists in the subbasin. These well document aspects of Arizona Water Law have been discussed by ADWR in the past and these are documented quite clearly in the ITAA scoping comments. Yet without analysis, the DEIS adopts and presents this 8.1 million acre-foot figure as the amount of water “estimated to be physically available in the aquifer.” (DEIS p. 342). The DEIS never confirms where this estimate of how much water is physically available in the aquifer actually comes from, whether it has been independently verified, what the range of uncertainty is, or any of the discussions which would otherwise accompany verifications being done as a proper part of NEPA analysis. This is a major point of concern which falls far short of the basic requirement for a “hard look” under NEPA. The DEIS further spends astonishingly little time analyzing the cumulative impacts of the Resolution Copper Mine water usage on regional water supplies – regional water supplies that are already limited by growth and pumping. In fact, the DEIS (p. 342) sets up and immediately dismisses its obligation to consider cumulative impacts, stating that although “groundwater demand is substantial and growing,” and that “the total demand on the groundwater resources in the East Salt River valley is substantial and could be greater than the estimated amount of physically available groundwater,” “it is not possible to quantify the cumulative water use in the area” due to “uncertainties.” Despite documented instances of residential wells in Pinal County already beginning to dry up at certain depths,29 no consideration is given to the steep costs to residential well owners in this region when they are forced to deepen their wells to access water in lower depths, an impact which Resolution Copper water use would contribute to potentially directly but also indirectly and cumulatively. This impact should have been considered but was absent from this DEIS. The DEIS is fundamentally flawed without these important discussions, since all of the proposed mine’s activities, in one way or another, involve water. "
"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","Impacts of activities in the desert wellfield (MARRCO corridor) including water pumping have not been fully considered under NEPA. The DEIS (p. 19) states that the water pipeline corridor to the New Magma Irrigation and Drainage District (NMIDD) irrigation canal is authorized under an existing Special Use Permit, but the next sentence also states: “Future activity within the MARRCO corridor potentially could be covered under the final mining plan of operations, rather than a special use permit.” Future activity in the MARRCO corridor includes at least the drilling of several dozen wells, construction of major power line infrastructure, new pump stations, grading and sloping, access roads, and an additional 50-foot easement (DEIS, Appendix G, p. G-10), all of which are major connected actions as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25, and which should have been fully analyzed in this DEIS. This is also required by the single environmental impact statement requirement of the NDAA as discussed at the beginning of this comment letter. "
"3.7.01","Water Resources: Groundwater Pumping","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","the DEIS fails to provide a full and fair discussion of the direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts of groundwater pumping in the MARRCO Corridor desert wellfield. There are many different problems that stem from this inadequate approach under NEPA. For example, it is well-documented that excessive, long-term extraction of groundwater can cause subsidence and fissures in the earth. These occurrences have been particularly concentrated in the East Salt River Valley subbasin, where over 500,000 AF of water would be pumped under the preferred Alternative 6. Regarding the East Salt River Valley subbasin, ADWR’s Water Planning Atlas states: “Earth fissuring and subsidence have occurred in the ESRV sub-basin due to localized pumping. These occurrences are found near Apache Junction and in the vicinities of Queen Creek, North Scottsdale and Paradise Valley (Rascona, 2005).”30 The University of Arizona’s Water Resources Research Center states: “Within the Salt River Valley are various locations where subsidence is occurring.”31 The DEIS (p. 334) contains no meaningful analysis of the potential subsidence from its large water uses, saying only that while groundwater pumping has already caused land subsidence in the wellfield area, a detailed analysis of land subsidence caused by withdrawals from this project is “not feasible” and that the impacts from one pumping source “cannot be predicted or quantified.” This is not a full nor a fair discussion of the potential environmental impacts caused by the large volume of proposed pumping in this area as required by 40 C.F.R. § 1502.1. Nor does any part of this discussion cite to supporting evidence, as required by 40 C.F.R. § 1502.1 (requiring that statements “shall be supported by evidence that the agency has made the necessary environmental analyses.”). Since subsidence due to water use is not analyzed in this DEIS, the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from that subsidence (such as the impacts of subsidence on the U.S. 60, S.R.79, and other nearby roadways, ground instability, impacts to wildlife, impacts to existing and planned infrastructure, etc.) are all absent from the DEIS. Drawdown contours are shown in Figure 3.7.1-2 (DEIS p. 298) which overlay nearby roadways and developed areas, but the impacts of these drawdowns on those features are never analyzed in the DEIS. The DEIS (p. ES-24) states that desert wellfield pumping in the East Salt River Valley MARRCO corridor “would incrementally contribute to the lowering of groundwater levels and cumulatively reduce overall groundwater availability in the area” but the DEIS contains no meaningful analysis of impacts or plans for mitigation. As discussed further in these comments, Resolution Copper’s water recharge and storage credits, which are “not required under Arizona water law” and a “voluntary measure” (DEIS p. 341) are non-binding by definition. They can be freely sold or exchanged at any time and thus, TNF cannot rely on the potential use of these credits for mitigation. Nevertheless, this is exactly what TNF does. See DEIS p. 333, stating “[t]he applicant-committed environmental protection measures include remedying any impacts on water supply wells caused by drawdown from the project.”). "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The groundwater model for the MARRCO wellfield is deficient. Although Resolution Copper purportedly intends to pump 540,000 acre-feet of water from groundwater resources (under the preferred Alternative 6, DEIS p. 99), the DEIS makes no attempt whatsoever to model or estimate groundwater resources and thus, makes no attempt to study the direct, indirect or cumulative impacts to these resources. This is a glaring deficiency in the DEIS and a plain violation of NEPA. The DEIS (p. 303) states that the groundwater flow model to predict pumping impacts from the MARRCO corridor desert wellfield was built by Resolution Copper “from an existing, calibrated, regulatory model prepared by ADWR” and, since the original model had been used for planning purposes since the 1990s, the modified model “did not require as extensive a review as the models prepared specifically for the mine.” This is wrong. TNF is required to review and fully understand models used in its DEIS, including any modifications to the existing model that has not been meaningfully described. Whether or not the original model is reliable or sufficient for current conditions is a question that TNF must independently verify. Further, to the extent this model has in some way been modified by Resolution Copper, these changes also must be subjected to the same thorough review in the DEIS. Overall, insufficient data is provided regarding the groundwater flow model on the MARRCO wellfield. The DEIS (p. 303) under the section titled “Model Used for Mine Water Supply Pumping Effects” indicates that Resolution Copper built a model from an existing ADWR model for this area. The DEIS states that a less extensive review was given to this model, yet TNF does not give an explanation why, or what this lower-level review supposedly entailed. As discussed above, it appears that Resolution Copper has taken an ADWR model and modified it or updated it in some way and no discussion appears anywhere in the DEIS about how this model was changed. This violates myriad requirements of NEPA. It is also noteworthy that ADWR has recently finalized a new groundwater model for this area, correcting errors and shortcomings in the older model. The model reflects a “major update” performed by ADWR in 2014 - “structural modifications” made in order to “address differences found between the simulated thickness of the aquifer materials and the thickness described in numerous well drillers’ logs.”32 According to the 2019 Pinal Model Technical Memorandum, “[c]hanges were also made in the East Salt River Valley (SRV) portion of the SRV model” based on significant structural modifications.33 Given the shortcoming in the modeling performed or used under this DEIS, TNF should perform a complete analysis of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of pumping using this new and updated model. If it requires modifications or recalibration for this purpose, this should be justified and disclosed for public review and scrutiny. The DEIS (p. 300) says that groundwater model results “could be reasonably assessed up to 200 years” but this statement is couched in multiple qualifiers with no explanation given for why only 200 years is the threshold. Additionally, although it is common scientific practice to do so, no range of uncertainty (such as ± 10-15 years, for example) accompanies this figure. This figure is relied upon as the basis for all quantitative results in the DEIS, but it is not a reliable figure. Furthermore, the vague expression of the estimated point of maximum groundwater drawdown or impact as “decades or even centuries” is a huge unusable range, and completely unreliable. A map (or discussion) of the groundwater model area boundaries for the East Salt River Valley analysis area are never provided. The DEIS (p. 298) claims that figure 3.7.1-2 shows the groundwater model boundaries/analysis area of the East Salt River valley model. However, figure 3.7.1-2 (p. 298), below, shows only a zoomed-in, limited portion of this groundwater model area – making it impossible to know what the analysis area does or does not include. The DEIS also contains no meaningful discussion whatsoever about the accuracy of the groundwater model. The DEIS contains multiple assurances that the groundwater model is precise since it produces results with “many decimal points” (p. 301). The DEIS states that the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup only assessed the groundwater model results for precision. This is not a scientifically sufficient way to evaluate results – both accuracy and precision are required which are totally independent concepts and not to be used interchangeably (as is done in BGC Engineering USA Inc. 2018d). “Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1. This DEIS fails to meet this requirement in violation of NEPA. As shown below, the analysis area of the water quality model omits critical segments of Queen Creek. Figure 3.7.2-1 shows what is included in the water model analysis area studied under this section (supposedly encompassing where groundwater or surface water quality changes could potentially occur under the project). The area studied is extremely insufficient for many reasons, including that only about half of the length of Queen Creek between the block-cave zone and Whitlow Dam is included in the analysis area, despite Resolution Copper having an AZPDES permit No. AZ0020389 that allows them to dewater Shafts 9 and 10 and to discharge mine wastewater into the unstudied portion of Queen Creek. An excerpted copy of Figure 3.7.2-1 (DEIS p.347) is inserted below with an arrow showing the approximate location of discharge under AZ0020389. The DEIS does not address why this study failed to include such a large portion of Queen Creek, but this is another glaring omission that is contrary to science and which fails to comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 1502.16 and the very first requirement on the list of requirements for an EIS at Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA (P.L. 91-190). Also, as noted briefly above, Resolution Copper’s water recharge and storage credits, which are “not required under Arizona water law” and a “voluntary measure” (DEIS p. 341) are not a requirement by definition and should not be relied upon by the TNF in any part of the DEIS. Therefore, it is improper for the recovery of these credits to be considered in any part of this water model. Yet the ADWR/Desert Wellfield Modeling Meeting minutes (cited as Garrett 2018a) contain the following statement: “Estimate that 10-30 feet of drawdown in the regional aquifer at Desert Wellfield has been avoided because of the long-term storage credits enabled by Resolution.” This estimate is inaccurate. Resolution Copper has stored water in multiple storage facilities located in various different sub-basins, many of which are nowhere near the Desert Wellfield.34 The DEIS lists the various storage facilities in vastly different locations in which Resolution Copper has banked, recharged or acquired credits but still concludes that “this offsets” its pumping (p.342). It does not. The drawdown will be the drawdown in this area, regardless of water credits voluntarily stored many miles away. Incorporation of any voluntarily acquired recharge and storage credits (which are not mandatory and can be resold at any time) into any water model for this project is an improper consideration under NEPA. This failure permeates much of the TNF’s water modeling and its analysis of the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of the pumping on local wells and regional water supplies. This violates NEPA.

"CU02","Cumulative: RFFA - Reasonably Foreseeable Future Activities","CU","Cumulative","The DEIS fails to mention or consider the increased water pumping facilitated by the Drought Contingency Plan in the East Salt River valley as a reasonably foreseeable future action and as part of a cumulative effects analysis. Under the Drought Contingency Plan (DCP), there is a widely known major federal action being implemented in Arizona via specific DCP approval legislation involving the same area where Resolution Copper’s new well fields will be located. That is, under the impending Tier 2 shortage, farmers in East Salt River Valley aquifer will develop new pumping infrastructure that will facilitate the new extraction of up to 70,000 AF of groundwater from the region – the very same region where Resolution Copper intends to develop its recovery well fields and potentially, significant mineral extraction wells under Arizona law. These reasonably foreseeable activities are in no way speculative. The DEIS fails to consider or even mention this. "
"3.7.01","Water Resources: Groundwater Pumping","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Significantly, the DEIS also does not state anywhere exactly how much water is already being pumped from groundwater resources in Pinal County, or how much more groundwater resources will be used over the next several years from this already-strained area under the actions facilitated under the DCP. "
"CU02","Cumulative: RFFA - Reasonably Foreseeable Future Activities","CU","Cumulative","Despite the prevalent nature of the State’s DCP actions in the media, the existence of federal legislation associated with DCP, and the subject specifically being raised in scoping by ITAA35 and subsequent information provided to SWCA representative Charles Coyle on April 2, 2019, the DEIS does not meaningfully address the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to Arizona’s water supplies and to Arizona’s water users stemming from Resolution Copper’s water pumping in the context of the past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions required for a cumulative impacts analysis. The contents of the April 2, 2019 email to SWCA are cited here below. Linked materials are incorporated into these comments. As part of the implementation of the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan in Arizona, water stakeholders, including the State of Arizona, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) cities and Tribes in the state, agreed to fund the development of groundwater infrastructure in Pinal County to supplant the loss of Colorado River water under DCP and during shortage on the Colorado River. The stakeholders agreed to help fund rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of new wells sufficient to provide 16,500 Acre-Feet of water in 2022 and 70,000 Acre-Feet of water in 2023 and thereafter. (See slide 10 of this presentation for a useful chart). In January, the Arizona legislature approved, and the Governor signed, a $9 Million appropriation from the state specifically for rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of new wells as part of the DCP approval legislation. In addition, CAP authorized the use of $5 Million of its revenues to be used for groundwater infrastructure. CAP also justified their appropriation as an investment in stored CAP water currently in Pinal County, with the expectation that the water will be called upon during shortage. This recovery of stored water should also be considered a Reasonably Foreseeable Activity. The Pinal County farmers currently expect to raise $25 Million, including the appropriations from the state and CAP, with the goal of seeking federal funding for an additional $25 Million through NRCS, USDA and possibly Reclamation. In the meantime, their supporters in the legislature continue to seek additional state funds to be used if the federal funding does not materialize (see video of the hearing, here). Analysis of reasonably foreseeable actions and reasonably foreseeable future actions (RFFAs) with potential to impact East Salt River Valley water supplies is virtually nonexistent from the cumulative impacts analysis in this DEIS. In addition to having been previously provided to TNF and SWCA, this information (which is also widely and publicly available) should have been considered in this DEIS. Regarding impacts to East Salt River Valley water supplies, the DEIS (p. 340-341) devotes one paltry paragraph to setting up a handful of vague actions and dismissing them all from consideration, stating that: Several reasonably foreseeable future actions were identified during the NEPA process but were determined too speculative to analyze for cumulative effects without detailed plans. These include potential housing developments in the town of Florence, and the ASLD’s planned Superstition Vistas development area. A number of approved, assured water supplies were also identified in the East Salt River valley, and these describe future use of water in enough detail to be considered for cumulative effects. All of these potential future actions have the potential to be cumulative in combination with the impacts from the Desert Wellfield, resulting in greater drawdown than projected from the Resolution Copper Project. Analysis of “Affected Environment” with regard to groundwater quantity in the East Salt River valley is a superficial three-paragraph overview which does not meaningfully discuss past and present actions in the region. The brief content does not meaningfully describe or the affected environment at all. Considering the enormous quantity of project water, which is planned to be extracted from this region, the DEIS must be corrected to properly analyze existing environmental characteristics as well all past, present and future reasonably foreseeable actions. The failure to do so violates NEPA. "
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","As discussed by hydrologist Bob Prucha in his expert report (attached in full here), analysis of groundwater in the DEIS is insufficient for many reasons, including but not limited to the following findings: 1. The formation of a pit lake wasn’t evaluated and is a major oversight of the DEIS (see Section 2.7.7). 2. Identification of impacted Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems (GDEs) is lacking (see Section 2.1). 3. Groundwater model development and calibration are flawed and predicted impacts to GDEs are unreliable and highly uncertain (see Sections 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7). 4. Groundwater and Surface Water models were created in virtual isolation from each other, despite clear evidence that the two are coupled in key GDE locations. Evaluation of impacts to stream-aquifer flows was not assessed, partly because hydrologic modeling software selected doesn’t have the capability of simulating this critical dynamic flow process. Inappropriate codes were used to assess impacts (see Section 2.4). Additionally, the DEIS (pp. 368-369) wrongfully attempts to draw meaningful conclusions about surface water quality characteristics for two sampling locations for which only one surface water sample has been collected (the Gila River below Donnelly Wash, and the Gila River below Dripping Spring Wash). Additionally, the DEIS notes that an undisclosed number of monitoring wells have been constructed in the Near West area in 2016 and 2017, but that “[g]roundwater quality results from these wells have not yet been submitted” (p. 367). Furthermore, the DEIS contains no information at all about what levels of contaminants from mine discharges, runoffs, seepage, or otherwise may be, or how and where these may impact surface waters and to what levels (DEIS pp. 369-370). Finally, the DEIS fails to independently study or even closely evaluate Resolution’s surface water sampling – rather, it accepts its conclusions about surface water chemistry without question which is entirely contrary to the foundational purpose of NEPA. All of this is inadequate, unscientific, and indicates a major failure to collect necessary data to conduct a reliable NEPA analysis. The DEIS should be redone to correct these failings. "
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Assessment of water quality degradation in the DEIS is inadequate. The DEIS (p. 364) wrongly says that “Resolution Copper is not proposing any direct discharges to surface waters.” A similar incorrect characterization can be found at p. 370. This is simply not correct. Resolution Copper has applied for and holds Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (AZPDES) Permit No. AZ0020389 issued by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Resolution Copper has applied for this permit to discharge up to 3.6 MGD of water into Queen Creek, an impaired water body which is listed on the CWA 303(d) Impaired Waters List as required by the EPA. Per the ADEQ Public Notice circulated on June 8, 2016: Resolution Copper Mining, LLC applied for a renewal AZPDES permit for discharge of mine site stormwater from Outfall 001 and treated mine drainage water from Outfall 002 from the Resolution Copper Mining, LLC – Superior mine. The discharge for both Outfall 001 and 002 is to an unnamed wash, tributary to Queen Creek. As ADEQ is the very first listed cooperating agency included in the DEIS (p. 6), information is readily available from ADEQ showing that RCM intends to and has sought a permit for directly discharging to surface waters. The DEIS (p. 364) incorrectly states that “assimilative capacity is the ability for a perennial water to receive additional pollutants without being degraded.” This is not correct. Per the Arizona Administrative Code Section R18-11-107.01(A), Tier 1 antidegradation criteria applies to: “a. A surface water listed on the 303(d) list for the pollutant that resulted in the listing, b. An effluent dependent water, c. An ephemeral water, d. An intermittent water, and e. A canal listed in Appendix B.” Regarding Tier 1 antidegradation protections, R-18-11-107 states: “The level of water quality necessary to support an existing use shall be maintained and protected. No degradation of existing water quality is permitted in a surface water where the existing water quality does not meet the applicable water quality standards.” As an impaired water body on the 303(d) Impaired Waters List, Queen Creek is subject to the heightened Tier 1 antidegradation criteria but this analysis is absent from the DEIS. Meaningful, full, and fair discussion should have been included in the DEIS on the potential for this project to degrade water quality. "
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS fails to analyze the impacts of the project on impaired waters. Queen Creek Reach No. 15050100-014A, (headwaters to the Superior Wastewater Treatment Plant discharge), has been listed on Arizona’s 303(d) list as impaired for dissolved copper since 2002. Reach No. 15050100-014B, (Superior Wastewater Treatment Plant discharge to Potts Canyon) has been listed as impaired for dissolved copper since 2004. Reach No. 15050100-014C (Potts Canyon confluence to the Whitlow Dam) has been listed as impaired for dissolved copper since 2010. As a condition of these listings, ADEQ is required to prepare a TMDL analysis for Queen Creek to identify the amount of pollutants the water body can receive and still meet water quality standards. On October 4, 2017, a draft TMDL analysis was released for public comment and comments were collected. This TMDL is still not complete. The DEIS (p. 370) claims that “only two reaches with the potential to receive additional pollutants caused by the Resolution Copper Project are Queen Creek below the Superior Wastewater Treatment Plant, due to runoff or seepage from Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, and the Gila River from the San Pedro River to Mineral Creek, due to runoff or seepage from Alternative 6.” This is incorrect. Resolution Copper holds AZPDES permit No. AZ0020389 to discharge dewatered mine project water into Queen Creek, and has held this permit since 2010. Although the DEIS (p. 365) acknowledges that TNF is required to identify which waters have been determined to be impaired, identify specifically where contaminants from the project could enter those waters and further pollute waters, and estimate the loading from that impairment, this analysis was not done as required by law. Additionally, no discussion at all is provided in the DEIS about the exact location(s) where contaminants could enter those waters as seepage or runoff from these tailings alternatives, nor is there any discussion of attempts to avoid or mitigate such runoff or seepage, impacts, or the potential levels of loading into each water body resulting from each of those discharges. Instead, after simply stating that runoff “could be captured by the subsidence crater” (p. 370), discussion in the DEIS on impacts to impaired waters concludes and is never meaningfully revisited. This is entirely unacceptable and fails to comply with the requirements of NEPA at 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14 to “rigorously explore and objectively evaluate” all reasonable alternatives. "
"CU01","Cumulative: Resource Impacts","CU","Cumulative","No Analysis was done regarding ongoing dewatering. 
In 1998, the Magma Mine was abandoned as a business decision.36 Ongoing dewatering in the existing shafts ceased and the shafts filled with water. Dewatering began again in 2009. As discussed earlier in these comments, the Oak Flat area groundwater model “no action” does not truly reflect baseline environmental conditions since it includes these ongoing dewatering activities. This is not a true representation of the groundwater features of the region. Additionally, impacts from these ongoing dewatering are never analyzed in the DEIS, since they are incorrectly assumed to be part of the “no action” alternative and their impacts are subsumed or baked into the environmental baseline. The decision to bake the impacts of dewatering into the environmental “no action” baseline and not analyze the impacts of dewatering is improper and violates NEPA. 
When an agency is evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse effects and there is incomplete or unavailable information, the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 1502.22 requires that “the agency shall always make clear that such information is lacking.” §1502.22(a) states: “If the incomplete information relevant to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, the agency shall include the information in the environmental impact statement.” Pursuant to §1502.22(b), if that information cannot be obtained because, “the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known, the agency shall include within the environmental impact statement,” the following: 
(1) A statement that such information is incomplete or unavailable; 
(2) a statement of the relevance of the incomplete or unavailable information to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment; 
(3) a summary of existing credible scientific evidence which is relevant to evaluating the reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment, and
(4) the agency's evaluation of such impacts based upon theoretical approaches or research methods generally accepted in the scientific community. For the purposes of this section, “reasonably foreseeable” includes impacts which have catastrophic consequences, even if their probability of occurrence is low, provided that the analysis of the impacts is supported by credible scientific evidence, is not based on pure conjecture, and is within the rule of reason.
 Regarding the decision to include continued dewatering as part of the no action alternative and supposedly disclosing effects of past dewatering, the DEIS (p. 300) cites Garrett 2018c, which states that conditions prior to the re-initiation of dewatering in 2009 is “historic” and that “stakeholders did not provide specific suggestions for how to obtain this historic information.” No discussion as required under 40 C.F.R. §1502.22 appears anywhere in the DEIS about any attempt to obtain this information. It appears that no discussion was ever even held with ADWR or ADEQ regarding the possibility of obtaining this information. The CEQ NEPA regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7 require an assessment of impacts. Despite the fact that dewatering is likely to cease at a point after mining operations, both of the DEIS groundwater modeling scenarios included ongoing dewatering in their baseline conditions (pp. 299-300) thus producing misleading modeling results. Furthermore, the DEIS refused to look at baseline groundwater conditions as they existed prior to Resolution Copper’s dewatering activities related to this project. This “moves the goalposts” (so to speak) in a very misleading manner as it does not present an accurate snapshot of true baseline groundwater conditions. This improperly places the impacts of dewatering outside the scope of NEPA review, which is unlawful. The USFS incorrectly attempts to rationalize this by claiming that even if the mine is not built, Resolution Copper would keep dewatering indefinitely “to preserve its infrastructure investment” (DEIS p. 300). This statement is factually unsupported for several reasons, only one of which is that dewatering ceased previously for business reasons in 1998 and nothing prevents Resolution Copper or its parent companies from unilaterally deciding again to cease dewatering operations for business or any other reason. This does not excuse the requirement to analyze all environmental impacts. Impacts from dewatering should have been fully analyzed in the DEIS. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The groundwater model for the Oak Flat parcel area “mine site” is deficient. Chapter 3.7 on Water Resources is full of assurances about the water model but fails to meaningfully address or remedy any of its weaknesses or failures. This is incredibly problematic, since the same model failed to predict the existence of 500-1000 GPM of 170-degree water encountered while drilling the #10 mine shaft in 2014.37 The groundwater model limitations were not meaningfully analyzed. The DEIS contains no discussion at all about the limitations of the chosen groundwater model. Assessments of the groundwater model selected for this project and its underlying assumptions are reportedly contained in the report cited as BGC Engineering USA Inc. 2018a (p. 296) – yet – this cited report is not about water at all – it is about geological data and subsidence and contains no discussions whatsoever about hydrology or groundwater modeling. A review of the other cited BGC Engineering studies (in an attempt to “guess” what the DEIS intended to cite) shows that while one report was published on the groundwater model, it addressed only the mine subsidence area and did not address the MARRCO wellfield, any of the tailings alternatives, or any other project areas at all. Review of this study is disappointingly inadequate, as several of the meaningful conclusions and concerns in this study are disregarded and not adopted in the DEIS. This violates requirements under NEPA for the preparation of EIS documents and it fails to provide the public with sufficient information to meaningfully comment on the proposal. This also indicates, once again, the rushed nature of the DEIS and the failure of the TNF to take the requisite “hard look” under NEPA. In addition to the foregoing, no meaningful analysis has been done regarding potential groundwater drawdowns. The DEIS (p. 334) asserts the following: “[P]redicted groundwater level trends indicate that the maximum drawdown would not occur […] for roughly 500 to 900 years” and cites a document referred to as Morey 2018c in support of these figures. If Morey 2018c is reviewed in an attempt to understand why this such large, rough range is given for a very important issue like groundwater drawdown, the reviewer finds that no meaningful, reliable scientific support exists for this figure. Morey 2018c consists of rough, unedited “meeting minutes” with incomplete phrases and sentences in which no particular speaker is even listed for points raised. Assertions in the DEIS about groundwater drawdown cite this document, but a review of its contents indicate that it does not lend scientific support to this statement. Again, “[a]ccurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1. This has not been done in this case. Nearly all of the background environmental groundwater descriptions for the East Plant Site (pp. 304-306) are copied from Resolution Copper’s GPO with no additional citations or discussions about the veracity of the data in the GPO. In comparing this section of the DEIS to the same section in the GPO, it is evident that the DEIS copied and pasted this section from the GPO. No independent verification or study to corroborate the information is cited anywhere in this section. This is contrary to the purpose of NEPA, which in part, requires the TNF to independently evaluate the environmental impacts of a proposed action. It is disturbing that the TNF would forego its clear obligations under NEPA and simply adopt Resolution Copper’s text on the nature of groundwater features in the project area without conducting any independent verification, particularly since (as previously discussed), RCM’s water model failed to predict 600 GPM, 170 degree hot water when sinking shaft #10. The Conceptual Cross Section of the Groundwater Systems (see figure 3.7.1-4, DEIS p. 305, reproduced above) shows no scale on either the X or Y axes. There is no way at all of knowing what depths or distances across, the data is meaningless without any of this. Despite a title referring to “Groundwater Systems,” the figure shows primarily geological features and only a thin floating line segments (with no axes to indicate location) to show water table locations. This image was taken from the General Plan of Operations and used here in the DEIS without any of these shortcomings being addressed.  "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Assessment of water quality on Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) is severely deficient. Water quality data for Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) tailings site is both incomplete and severely inadequate. Regarding Skunk Camp tailings site, the DEIS (p. 358) reveals the following: “Background groundwater quality is derived from a single sample in November 2018 from a well located adjacent to Dripping Spring Wash. Background surface water quality is derived from a single sample in November 2018 from the Gila River at the confluence with Dripping Spring Wash.” “Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1. Agencies are “under an affirmative mandate to ‘insure the professional integrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussions and analyses in environmental impact statements[,] identify any methodologies used and . . . make explicit reference by footnote to the scientific and other sources relied upon for conclusions[.]’ 40 C.F.R. § 1502.24.” Environmental Defense Fund v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 515 F. Supp. 2d 69 (D.C. Dist. Ct. 2007). As such, no meaningful analysis can be done or conclusions drawn based upon a single sample. No explanation was given as to why only single samples were collected. This is extremely deficient and fails on its face to meet any level of integrity or scientific reasonability, let alone proper analysis under NEPA.
The DEIS (p. 363) states: “Alternatives 5 and 6 not only meet water quality objectives as modeled but have substantial additional capacity to do so, and flexibility.” This section on “Conclusion as to reasonableness of models,” a critical section, is unfinished in the DEIS and ends with this truncated sentence.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of the mitigation requirement: “Omission of a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures would undermine the ‘action forcing’ function of NEPA. Without such a discussion, neither the agency nor other interested groups and individuals can properly evaluate the severity of the adverse effects.” Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. at 352. Regarding limitations of the mine site groundwater model, the DEIS (pp. 295-296) says that “regardless of what the model might predict, a monitoring plan would be implemented to ensure that actual real-world impacts are fully observed and understood.” First, “would be implemented” is not as affirmative as stating that it “would” or “shall” be, which is a matter of concern. Further, no timeline is given at all here for what the monitoring plan is, who would oversee it and for how long, or even when it would be implemented (1 year? 10? 100?). Additionally, no explanation is given about what is meant by “real-world impacts.” Finally, what steps would be taken if an impact occurs which is not predicted by the model? None of these points are addressed. This is insufficient under NEPA. The monitoring plan, if indeed one even exists at all, has not been provided as part of this DEIS for public comment. The groundwater models in this project, for reasons including as discussed herein, are flawed and based upon problematic assumptions which raise concerns about the reliability of their predictions. Monitoring and mitigation plans should have been meaningfully discussed, analyzed, and included in the DEIS in full for public review and comment. Anything short of this violates NEPA. Regarding limitations of the East Salt River Valley groundwater model, the DEIS (p. 303) says again that “if monitoring identifies real-world impacts that were not predicted by the modeling, mitigation would be implemented.” Since mitigation plans have not yet been written, the DEIS failed to outline any mitigation details or analyze their sufficiency. Again, it is still unclear what is meant by “real-world impacts.” Additionally, the groundwater models in this project, for reasons including as discussed herein, are flawed and based upon problematic assumptions which raise serious concerns about the reliability of their predictions. This is insufficient pursuant to notice and comment requirements under NEPA. Monitoring and mitigation plans should have been included in the DEIS for public comment. Appendix D of the DEIS, the Draft Conceptual Compensatory Mitigation Plan, should have analyzed these concerns pursuant to Army Corps 404 permitting. "
"3.8.05","Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species: Special Status Wildlife Species","3.8","Section 3.8 - Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species","The DEIS fails to analyze specific project impacts on Bald and Golden Eagles or other raptors, discuss mitigation, or the potential necessity of a take permit under BGEPA, MBTA, or other applicable law. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (“BGEPA”), 16 U.S.C. § 668-668d, protects eagles by prohibiting unauthorized take (which includes to pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb) of eagles, unless allowed by a permit. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”), 16 U.S.C.§§703-712, similarly protects certain migratory birds by prohibiting unauthorized take, possession, import, export, transport, sale, purchase, barter, or offer for sale any migratory birds or bird parts, nests, or eggs except under the terms of a permit. As discussed above, Eagles also play a significant role in the religious, cultural, and traditional practices of many Tribes and are TCPs. Table 3.8.4-2 of the DEIS (p. 466) notes that modeled habitat acreage for the Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) appears in all alternatives. The word “Yes” is marked next to BGEPA, yet the remainder of the DEIS does not contain any information about whether a take permit for RCM has been discussed, applied for, evaluated, or otherwise by any of the involved parties in this project. Failure to apply for and obtain a take permit violates BGEPA. Additionally, as discussed above, eagles are considered traditional cultural properties (TCP) subject to NRHP § 106 and impacts to those TCPs must be considered as part of the NEPA process. This has not been done in the DEIS. While the Resolution Copper mine is likely to impact eagles, raptors, and avian species, specific analysis of these impacts (including avoidance, mitigation, or otherwise) is largely missing from the DEIS. The DEIS (p. 460) states vaguely that concentrations of certain constituents in tailings seepage ponds above chronic and some acute exposure limits may “lead to short- and longterm impacts on some avian species” and cites a document titled Screening of Geochemistry Predictions for Effects on Wildlife Process Memorandum by Newell 2018k. However, this citation poses several concerns, namely: 􀁸 There is no study with that title posted on the project webpage under the Documents Cited page. 􀁸 There is no specific reference in this section to what types of avian species would be affected, what levels of mortality are anticipated, and if any threatened/endangered/protected species may be impacted. 􀁸 Additionally, there is no reference at all to any take permits, or any mitigation of the impacts to avian species from the constituent levels in these tailings seepage ponds. 􀁸 Finally, there is no data on how much higher constituent concentrations are expected to be above these chronic and acute exposure levels. 􀁸 A different document titled Wildlife Resource Analysis: Assumptions, Methodology Used, Relevant Regulations, Laws, and Guidance, and Key Documents by Newell 2018i notes that “Bald and golden eagle habitat occurs within the Resolution Copper Project analysis area for wildlife” but no actual analysis on this is done either in this document or the DEIS. Additionally, the “analysis area” does not cover the entire project area and notably excludes power line corridors and rights-of-way. The DEIS (p. 461) notes that project operations and maintenance may result in “electrocution of birds and from striking electrical distribution lines,” but asserts vaguely and without support that impacts will supposedly be minor, and not significant. 􀁸 Table 3.8.4-2 (p. 466) does not contain any information whatsoever about species occurring in the main project area (East Plant Site or West Plant Site), the MARRCO well recovery field, the filter plant and loadout facility, any pipelines and transmission lines, etc., only for the tailings alternatives. The DEIS (p. 458) adopts RCM’s promise verbatim that electric power transmission and distribution line towers will be designed and constructed “to avoid raptor electrocutions” and cites the GPO and Appendix X, Wildlife Management Plan, Resolution Copper 2016c. 􀁸 First, the word “raptor” does not appear anywhere in the document cited as Resolution Copper (2016c). Section 3.1.1 of Resolution Copper (2016c) on Avian Species does not name any specific avian species. 􀁸 The DEIS makes no effort to define what species of raptors would be impacted or avoided. 􀁸 The DEIS improperly excluded power line analysis from the NEPA review process, as discussed further herein. Review of these construction designs should have been done as part of this DEIS and failure to include this is contrary to NEPA. No information is provided here about which types of raptors, how RCM plans to design its facilities to avoid electrocutions while still complying with other design requirements. Finally, although many project activities have the potential or likelihood to pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb, the DEIS fails to analyze any other direct, indirect, or cumulative project impacts on Bald and Golden eagles, protected migratory birds or other avian/raptor species from project activities such as project light and noise, vibration, air quality issues, water quality issues, construction, subsidence, dewatering and water withdrawal, and otherwise.

"IA02","Issues Analysis: Resource Surveys","IA","Issues Analysis","Sonoran Desert Tortoise & Gila Monster The DEIS (p. 458) indicates only that pre-construction surveys for Sonoran desert tortoise and Gila monster will be conducted “before surface ground-disturbing activities start,” which means that they have not been done. This is improper under NEPA since these surveys should have been done during the NEPA process and subject to public comment. A vague promise to conduct important surveys after-the-fact on lands which, in part, will likely have already been transferred out of state and federal jurisdiction and into private ownership of Resolution Copper is grossly inadequate for the purposes of NEPA review. Regarding mitigation and avoidance, the DEIS (p. 458) merely states that project crews will be “instructed” to look below construction equipment for these species and to move them out of harm’s way if observed. This insufficient for the purposes of mitigation under NEPA. "
"3.8.01","Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species: General Wildlife","3.8","Section 3.8 - Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species","“Habitat Blocks” are used to discuss wildlife, this term is undefined. The DEIS (p. 454, 459, and Table 3.8.4-1 at pp. 464-465) refers to something called a “habitat block,” citing Perkl 2013 as a supporting document for more information about this term. However, the Perkl 2013 document does not contain the phrase “habitat block” anywhere. Table 3.8.4-1 references “Habitat Block 1” and “Habitat Block 2” and cites Morey 2018a, but these terms are not defined anywhere in the DEIS, nor does it appear anywhere in the cited document (Morey 2018a). Table 3.8.4-1 is useless for purposes of NEPA without any supporting information about the meaning and scope of its contents. The inaccurate and incomplete citation work in this DEIS makes it impossible to meaningfully research and comment on matters in the document such as this. This sort of failure under NEPA permeates the entire DEIS. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.24 requires agencies to “insure the professional integrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussions and analyses in environmental impact statements. They shall identify any methodologies used and shall make explicit reference by footnote to the scientific and other sources relied upon for conclusions in the statement. An agency may place discussion of methodology in an appendix.” See also Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, Chapter 20, §23.33. The DEIS (p. 481) also states that thousands of acres of “various habitat” would be forever impacted, “may never return to pre-mining conditions” and irreversibly reduce habitat quality. TNF claims to know the specific habitat acreage of all individual species for all of the tailings alternatives (Table 3.8.4-2), yet does not make any attempt to list any of the species whose habitat would be forever diminished or how these impacts would be mitigated. Again, this is insufficient under NEPA. "
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","The USFS jurisdiction is mischaracterized. The DEIS inaccurately states that the Forest Service will no longer have jurisdiction over forest lands impacted by the land exchange (p. 14). This is inaccurate. The land exchange will impact a significant area of Forest Service lands remaining under Forest Service jurisdiction, including but not limited to pipeline rights of way, roads, power line corridors, and areas which will experience water and air impacts. The TNF cannot legally cede this jurisdiction or avoid consideration of direct, indirect, and cumulative actions associated with the project on these lands under existing laws and NEPA. Any attempt to do so is inconsistent with Federal law. "
"CU02","Cumulative: RFFA - Reasonably Foreseeable Future Activities","CU","Cumulative","Long-Term Effects and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions It is established that “an agency cannot defer analyzing the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of an activity past the point when that activity can be precluded.” WildEarth Guardians v. Zinke, 368 F.Supp. 3d 41 at 65 (D.C. Dist. Ct. 2019). Analysis of reasonably foreseeable future actions or RFFAS (defined as “[t]hose Federal or Non-Federal activities not yet undertaken, for which there are existing decisions, funding, or identified proposals” at 36 C.F.R. § 220.3) is a mandatory component of the cumulative impact analysis required as part of NEPA. 40 C.F.R § 1508.7 further specifies that this is required “regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.” Therefore, an incomplete analysis of RFFAs indicates that the legally required cumulative impacts analysis is also incomplete. The DEIS (pp. 476-477) lists only a handful of reasonably foreseeable future actions as likely to occur in conjunction with the mine project, and omits major actions which the TNF was or should have been aware of at the time this DEIS was released. For instance, as discussed earlier in this comment document, the Arizona Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan with extensive media coverage and political discussions leading up to the signing of approval legislation in January 2019. Among many other provisions, approximately $14 million was appropriated by the State of Arizona and Central Arizona Project for rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of new wells, particularly by agricultural users in Pinal County who will begin pumping using groundwater resources. An additional $25 million in federal funding for these purposes is being pursued, for the purpose of recovering stored groundwater in Pinal County. As has been widely, extensively, and publicly discussed, inevitable shortages on the Colorado River in the coming years will result in cuts to CAP allocations. For Pinal County agricultural water users, this loss of CAP water will be replaced by pumped groundwater from the East Salt River valley. Both existing decisions and funding exist on this plan (requirements under 36 C.F.R. §220.3) and yet it was improperly omitted from analysis in the DEIS. The DEIS (p. 479) states that other projects “not yet planned” are expected to occur in this portion of Arizona, but fails to list what those projects are, or acknowledge whether any decisions have been made or funding appropriated for those projects. If so, then those projects have been improperly omitted from the DEIS as potential RFFAs. "
"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","Proper analysis has not been done on the power infrastructure, rights-of-way, and associated transmission infrastructure required for this project. The DEIS specifies that two new 230kV transmission line corridors will be required for the Resolution mine project. One will run from the Silver King substation to the Oak Flat substation and the other will run from the RCM West Plant site to the Oak Flat substation. The DEIS lists activities which would be included in mine operations and says (p. 9) that “the Forest Service can approve SRP’s construction and operation of new power lines on NFS lands by either a special use permit or as part of the GPO.” The document continues on to say that the line rightsof- way are analyzed in the DEIS. This is untrue. No discussion appears anywhere in the DEIS looking at impacts of these new and expanded rights-of-way on things such as wildlife and vegetation, visual impacts, cultural resource, air quality or other resources found within these rights-of-way. More power infrastructure than just rights-of-way will be constructed. The DEIS (p. 42) states that auxiliary facilities would be constructed to support underground mine workings, including “electrical substations, along with transmission and distribution systems, to provide power to the underground facilities and equipment.” The DEIS (p. 56) states: “[s]ubstations also would need to be upgraded and/or new 230-kV substations would need to be constructed.” First, upgrading the existing 115kV transmission lines is impossible since those existing lines must remain in place, and so new rights-of-way will need to be constructed. Second, even if the existing 115kV transmission lines were to be replaced with 230kV transmission lines (which they are not), the total footprint for 230kV lines is much larger than 115kV lines and thus, new analysis would be required in either case. An entirely new transmission line would be required for Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) tailings location, if chosen. As the DEIS (pp. 97-98) states: “A new power line would be constructed from the existing Silver King substation north of U.S. 60 and Oak Flat that would follow a southeast alignment for 11.7 miles to the Skunk Camp location. Preliminary assessment of line voltage options show that either a 69-kV or 115-kV voltage level would be adequate to supply power to Skunk Camp. Further assessment by the electrical utility operating Silver King substation would be needed to determine the adequate voltage and construction engineering, including access roads to service Skunk Camp.” The DEIS fails entirely to analyze this obvious requirement that a new substation would also be required at this site to convert the high-voltage power being transmitted through the transmission lines into distribution voltages for use. As discussed earlier, since only a single EIS is being done for all components of this project, details regarding this new transmission line including “construction engineering” should have been fully analyzed in this DEIS and subject to public review and comment, including by those who may be affected by it. In a similar way, the new 69kV transmission line along the MARRCO corridor and the new 69kV substation near the loadout facility also requires (and currently lacks any) thorough NEPA analysis for possible impacts to wildlife, air, water, cultural and historic resources, and other possible impacts. The DEIS vaguely mentions these requirements, but fails completely to consider their impacts or any other required treatment under NEPA. Section §3003(c)(9)(B) specifically referenced power infrastructure as a component of the single EIS, stating that the granting of any “permits, rights-of-way, or approvals for the construction of associated power” shall be based on this single EIS. As noted in some detail at the outset of these comments, all of this must be included in the current EIS under the NDAA and as a connected action. The failure violates existing law and NEPA. "
"CU01","Cumulative: Resource Impacts","CU","Cumulative","Cumulative Effects Analysis is Insufficient. There is also an inadequate scope of inquiry and analysis into the cumulative effects. As discussed throughout ITAA’s comments, in many sections of the DEIS, some listing of actions is provided for the purpose of a cumulative effects analysis but there is a failure to provide the actual analysis. Mere identification of other actions affecting the resources which would be affected by the proposed action (as is done in many places in this DEIS) is only the first step toward an actual analysis. However, there is scant substantive and meaningful analysis in the text of this DEIS, and in many places, analysis is missing entirely.

Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.” As described throughout this comment letter, the DEIS fails in several ways to evaluate the cumulative impacts of the proposed mine on the environment. First, there is insufficient identification of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions that continue to have, are having, or likely to have an impact on the same resources that would be affected by the proposed Resolution Copper mine. The DEIS never discusses these in any comprehensive or meaningful way, and only lists a few reasonably foreseeable future actions in piecemeal, stating in several places that “As noted in section 3.1, past and present actions are assessed as part of the affected environment.” (DEIS pp. 206, 233, 269, 292, 340, 419, 444, 476, 509, 554, 572, 582, 619, 636, 656, 668, 684, and 700). No comprehensive analysis of the “Affected Environment” ever appears in the DEIS, instead is confusingly segmented under specific topics for no apparent reason (DEIS pp. 134, 165, 215, 246, 280, 303, 366, 424, 451, 484, 520, 562, 576, 588, 625, 641, 661, 675, 689).

"MIT01","Mitigation: General","MIT","Mitigation","Monitoring and Mitigation is Insufficient.
 The identification of possible mitigation measures is an integral and important part of NEPA analysis. While NEPA does not require mitigation, it does require the identification of possible mitigation measures for adverse environmental impacts. As the U.S. Supreme Court has said: Implicit in NEPA’s demand that an agency prepare a detailed statement on ‘any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,’ 42 U.S.C. §4332(C)(ii), is an understanding that the EIS will discuss the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided. [cite omitted] More generally, omission of a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures would undermine the ‘action forcing’ function of NEPA. Without such a discussion, neither the agency nor other interested groups and individuals can properly evaluate the severity of the adverse effects. An adverse effect that can be fully remediated by, for example, an inconsequential public expenditure is certainly not as serious as a similar effect that can only be modestly ameliorated through the commitment of vast public and private resources. Recognizing the importance of such a discussion in guaranteeing that the agency has taken a ‘hard look’ at the environmental consequences of proposed federal action, CEQ regulations require that the agency discuss possible mitigation measures in defining the scope of the EIS, 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(b) (1987), in discussing alternatives to the proposed action § 1502.14(f), and consequences of that action, § 1502.16(h), and in explaining its ultimate decision, § 1505.2(c). Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. at 352 (1989). A mere perfunctory description of mitigation measures is inconsistent with the “hard look” the USFS is required to take under NEPA. Rather, “[m]itigation must ‘be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.” City of Carmel-Bythe- Sea v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 123 F.3d 1142, 1154 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 353 (1989)). “A mere listing of mitigation measures is insufficient to qualify as the reasoned discussion required by NEPA.” Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n v. Peterson, 795 F.2d 688, 697 (9th Cir. 1986) (rev’d on other grounds), 485 U.S. 439 (1988). As noted earlier, the DEIS’s identification of mitigation measures for the many severe adverse impacts identified in the document is extremely deficient. The DEIS (p. 159) even states that the USFS’ mitigation plan is not yet complete but that it is “in the process of developing” that plan. Appendix J Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is actually not a plan at all, but rather is described in the DEIS (p. 159) as merely “descriptions of mitigation concepts being considered.” Furthermore, any voluntary mitigation and protection measures proposed by Resolution Copper are uncertain by definition: 􀁸 The “voluntarily” raised suggestion to move the process water pond (DEIS p. 100); 􀁸 Resolution Copper’s promise to “voluntarily” follow industry best practices (DEIS p. 520); 
􀁸 “[R]echarging water and acquiring storage credits […] is a voluntary measure by Resolution Copper” (DEIS p. 341); 
􀁸 Groundwater sampling and ongoing cleanup at the West Plant Site is “voluntary” (DEIS p. 367); 􀁸 Study and remediation of contaminated soils at the West Plant Site is being done “under the authority of the ADEQ Voluntary Remediation Program” (DEIS p. 577); 
􀁸 Resolution Copper “would voluntarily commit to conservation actions” with regard to stock tanks, AZGFD wildlife waters, and the conservation needs of proposed or candidate species of wildlife including the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, and bats (DEIS p. 480; Appendix J, pp. J-11, J-12). 
None of these should be considered as reliable “concepts” (let alone plans) for mitigation under NEPA. 
For a number of serious impacts, there are simply no mitigation measures identified in the DEIS. This is particularly true with regard to cultural and historic resources and the religious freedom of impacted tribal members. Also, in several sections, such as water, the mitigation that is proposed is severely inadequate. Since mitigation is currently only in the “consideration” phase as a discussion of “concepts,” the enforceability of certain measures for a number of types of impacts is never addressed, and where addressed, is meaningless without an actual, identified, mitigation plan. Again, this violates NEPA. 
Similarly, there is little to no discussion of monitoring for many affected resources in the DEIS (including but not limited to the impacts of water use in the MARRCO wellfield). Thus, the public has no way of commenting on whether and how the TNF, other involved public agencies and the affected communities could determine whether any mitigation “concepts” (if ever even selected and developed as mitigation plans) would ever actually be implemented and, if so, what their effectiveness might be over the lifetime of the proposed mine and following its shutdown. These failures violate NEPA and the USFS obligations. See Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. U.S. Forest Service, 137 F.3d 1372 at 1381; see also Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 387 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2004) (rejecting as insufficient an environmental assessment that failed to meaningfully analyze mitigation measures where the agency concluded that the “[i]mpacts are being avoided by project design,” because “[t]he EA[s] are silent as to the degree that each factor will be impacted and how the project design will reduce or eliminate the identified impacts.”). 
An essential component of a reasonably complete mitigation plan must include an assessment of whether the proposed mitigation measures can be effective. Compare Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. U.S. Forest Service, 137 F.3d 1372, 1381 (9th Cir. 1998) (disapproving an EIS that lacked such an assessment) with Okanogan Highlands Alliance v. Williams, 236 F.3d 468, 477 (9th Cir. 2000) (upholding an EIS where “[e]ach mitigating process was evaluated separately and given an effectiveness rating”). The Supreme Court has required a mitigation discussion precisely for the purpose of evaluating whether anticipated environmental impacts can be avoided. See Methow Valley, 490 U.S. at 351-52 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(ii)). 
A mitigation discussion without at least some evaluation of effectiveness is useless in making that determination under NEPA. None of these requirements were met in the DEIS and they are not being met today. In short, broad generalizations and vague references to mitigation “concepts being considered” by the USFS in the DEIS do not constitute the requisite detail that is required by NEPA and other applicable laws, since they fail to disclose at any level of specificity what mitigation measures would be undertaken and the potential effectiveness of these measures. At this phase in the Project, USFS’s failed approach to mitigation is simply unacceptable. The DEIS must be redone for these reasons stated herein. 
The broad generalizations and vague references in the DEIS to potential monitoring and mitigation measures that may be used in the future also do not address all of the known impacts of the project, and thus fail to provide sufficient detail and certainty relative to mitigation measures. "

(See Emerman’s full report in the Appendix with the same title)
 Hydrologic and geologic expert, Dr. Steve Emerman conducted a study into land subsidence due to panel caving at the proposed mine site. The Resolution Copper Mine that is being proposed would process up to 150,000 metric tons of ore per day from an ore body at a depth of 5,000-7,000 feet. The mining would be carried out using block caving, a type of underground mining that involves controlled cave-ins of overlying rock. Panel caving, the particular variation of block caving that would be used at the Resolution Copper Mine, divides the ore body into smaller panels that are mined sequentially. Land subsidence is a typical consequence of block caving. Rio Tinto has predicted that the maximum depth of the crater will be 984 feet, but that the subsidence zone will reach only 1,500 feet from the sacred escarpment of Apache Leap. Rio Tinto has provided a description of the types of data used to predict subsidence, but not the actual data or the details of the modeling. The only exception is a map of the geological faults, which are the most important structures that transmit deformation. In that case, it can be shown from satellite imagery and aerial photography that the West Boundary Fault, which connects the footprint of the ore body with Apache Leap, was mapped in the wrong location with an offset of 2000 feet. Rio Tinto has described an extensive program of subsidence monitoring that relies on the assumption that “subsidence is a slow and gradual process that is predicted…and controlled.” However, unanticipated subsidence occurs in 20% of block caving projects and the manual relied upon by Rio Tinto emphasizes the known risks of rapid subsidence and rockbursts. No error bounds have been provided on the limits of the subsidence zone. However, based upon the uncertainty in the prediction of maximum crater depth (coefficient of variation = 20%), the probability that the subsidence zone will reach Apache Leap is 5.3%, not taking into account any incorrect data used by Rio Tinto. By any standards, this is regarded as an unacceptable risk for the destruction of irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.
 Emerman notes in his study of the evaluation of predictions of land subsidence due to panel caving at the proposed RCM that the DEIS estimates for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine a maximum crater depth of 800-1,115 feet with closest approach to Apache Leap of 1,115 feet. The previous estimates were maximum crater depth of 656-984 feet with closest approach to Apache Leap of 1,500 feet. There is no explanation as to why these two estimates have changed. There is still no estimate of the uncertainty in the closest approach to Apache Leap. There is also no explanation as to the statistical interpretation of a range of 800-1,115 feet for the maximum crater depth. A possible interpretation is 800-1,115 feet means (957.5 ± 157.5) feet, where the uncertainty is the standard deviation. In this case, the coefficient of variation would be 16.4%.

"3.2.01","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Surface Subsidence","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence"," The conclusions of the study entitled, Evaluation of Predictions of Land Subsidence due to Panel Caving at the Resolution Copper Mine, Arizona, can be summarized as follows: 
● The predictions of land subsidence due to panel caving at the proposed Resolution Copper Mine cannot be verified because Rio Tinto has provided neither the data, the details of the modeling, nor the reports from the consultants. 
● The only exception to the lack of data is the map of geological faults, which is inconsistent with the aerial photography and satellite imagery that show a pronounced lineament nearly parallel to and offset by 2000 feet from the mapped West Boundary Fault. This lineament would most likely be the zone of structural weakness that would transmit deformation from the caved rock zone to the sacred escarpment of Apache Leap. 
● The subsidence monitoring program proposed by Rio Tinto explicitly assumes that subsidence will be slow, predictable and controlled, which is inconsistent with the past history of block caving and authoritative manuals on block caving. 
● Rio Tinto has provided no error bounds on the predictions of the lateral extent of the subsidence zone. 
● Based on the range in predictions of the maximum depth of the subsidence crater, the probability that the subsidence zone would reach Apache Leap can be estimated as 5.3%. This probability is about 500 times greater than what would be generally regarded as an unacceptable risk for the loss of irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.

Rio Tinto is a primary partner in Oyu Tolgoi, LLC, the operator of the Oyu Tolgoi mine being developed in southern Mongolia. Underground mine operations at Oyu Tolgoi are being planned as a block cave mine. 
An announcement during the first half of 2019 of “ground instability problems” at the Oyu Tolgoi site encountered during construction of the underground mine and associated infrastructure are correlated with a severe drop in the share price of Turquoise Hill Resources, Rio Tinto’s corporate partner in Rio Tinto’s majority ownership share in the OT project. 
The relatively undefined “ground instability problems” are severe enough to result in projection of a two-three year delay in underground mine ore production and a projected $1-2 billion dollar expense to address the “ground instability problems.” 
As Resolution is proposed as a block cave mine, an analysis of the implications of the Oyu Tolgoi ground instability problem should be incorporated into a revised or supplemental DEIS and FEIS for the Resolution project to verify that the ground instability problem that RTZ’s Oyu Tolgoi geoanalysts failed to identify until after significant construction had begun at OT.

While Fig 3.7-1.6 P. 308 359/1338 shows the Apache Leap Tuff (Tal) groundwater level prior to mine operation, the DEIS fails to illustrate the impact of the block cave subsidence zone on the Tal groundwater system. As the block cave mine will cause large, permanent collapse and fracture zone in the Tal and underlying geologic structures down to the ore zone, all groundwater in the Tal, and underlying geologic structure affected by block cave mine subsidence and fracturing will permanently drain to the mine eliminating flows through the Tal to any of the groundwater discharge points, along with eliminating surface flows in the Oak Flat and Devil’s Canyon stream systems. The DEIS should be revised to illustrate and describe the irreversible and irretrievable damage to surface water and groundwater current stored in or flowing on the Tal and other subsided or fractured geological structure likely to be affected by the proposed operation of the block cave mine.

While there is mining in the region, the area around Oak Flat is still a place of beauty that is used by hikers, campers, climbers, birdwatchers, and more. 
As noted above, the DEIS fails to consider and analyze the impacts to recreation from this visual blight. People going to Picketpost Mountain, the Boyce Thompson Arboretum State Park, the southeastern portion of the Superstition Wilderness Area, and the White Canyon Wilderness Area, among other important recreational areas, will be assaulted by this industrialization of the landscape. Many of these areas would suffer visual impacts from tailings pile locations, making them less attractive for those seeking to get away from development and blight and to enjoy the beauty of the Arizona landscape.

Only a total of 15 monitoring stations were used to determine background noise levels. Monitoring was only done at some locations once over the course of a week in June of either 2015 or 2016. In addition, some locations also monitored for an additional week in November. As there was no discussion of why those dates were chosen, we wonder whether the were selected to skew the data. For Example, June was used to monitor for “summer” conditions, but as June is still moderate enough for outdoor recreation and other activities, perhaps July or August would be a better time period. For “winter” monitoring, January or February would be better than November, which is still a shoulder month. In any case, the monitoring periods were too short and should have been conducted either continuously or at least in each month over the course of a year to get a more representative sample.
 We also question why the monitoring at Oak Flat was done so close to the East Plant facility and to several drilling rigs operating in that area. There were certainly other areas at Oak Flat that would have given a more representative sampling of background noise.

The DEIS estimates in quantitative detail, often expressed in dollar terms, the projected socioeconomic “benefits” to the local and regional economies associated with the construction, operation, and reclamation of the proposed RCM project. However, when it comes to discussing the socioeconomic costs that would be associated with the project, the DEIS asserts that the negative socioeconomic impacts of the RCM project are mostly difficult or impossible to quantify, especially in monetary terms. The DEIS quantifies only a tiny part of the potential negative impacts on what the DEIS labels the “nature-based tourism economy,” namely the reduction in hunter spending in the local economy or the reduction in revenue to the state of Arizona because of reduced sale of hunting permits. Both of these are only tiny fractions of the damage to the “nature-based tourism economy” that will be caused by RCM. In addition, “nature-based tourism” is only a part of the overall value of the environmental services provided to residents, not visitors (“tourists”), by the natural landscapes that will be threatened by the RCM. Both the impact on residents and visitors are important components of the economic base supporting local economic vitality. High quality of life is not a benefit only enjoyed by visitors nor is it only visitors to whom recreational opportunities are important. 
 This imbalance in the treatment of the commercial “benefits” of the RCM and the commercial and non-commercial costs associated with the RCM distorts the socioeconomic analysis provided in the DEIS in a way that exaggerates the benefits and understates the costs. It represents a “thumb on the scales” in the evaluation of the positive and negative impacts of the proposed mine. 
The well-being of residents may be directly improved by natural services provided by the natural environment: clean air and water, scenic beauty, open-space, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, etc. Many of these natural environmental services are not commercial products but, rather, flow from high quality natural environments and are available to all residents or visitors to such areas without any commercial transaction. The availability of these natural environmental services in particular areas, however, trigger behaviors of commercial significance as people seek access to high quality natural services or flee areas where natural environments have been degraded. 
The DEIS and studies it cites documents the large positive socioeconomic impacts of “Travel and Tourism” on Pinal County where the RCM project would be located and adjacent areas. In particular the DEIS documents the high level of visitor spending, the large number of jobs associated with that spending, the huge flow of visitors to the Tonto National Forest and the high spending levels of the visiting parties. The Tonto National Forest is identified as one of the most heavily used National Forests for motorized recreation. Wildlife viewing, by itself, contributes substantially to Pinal County’s economy. (Appendix D, Deficiency No. 1, Sections 1 and 2) 
The DEIS in its conclusions to the Socioeconomic section (3.13) states that while there may be some permanent losses of jobs and income associated with recreation and amenity-supported economic vitality, the losses are not quantified and are discussed in qualitative terms: 
“Loss of jobs in the local tourism and outdoor recreation industries cannot be avoided or fully mitigated. Likewise, loss in property values for property close to the mine would constitute an impact that cannot be avoided or fully mitigated.” ………………………….. “Some changes in the nature of the surrounding natural setting and landscape would be permanent, including the tailings storage facility and the subsidence area. The action alternatives would therefore potentially cause irreversible impacts on the affected area with regard to changes in the local landscape,  community values, and quality of life.” 
3 8 As indicated by the summary statements quoted above, the DEIS does recognize that the construction and operation of the RCM will damage the natural landscapes on which the recreational economy depends and, for that reason, will have negative impacts on an important part of the local and regional economy. The DEIS, however, does not quantify those negative RCM impacts in the same way it quantifies the positive RCM socioeconomic impacts. As a result, the RCM’s negative socioeconomic impacts, the “costs” are understated and the positive impacts, the “benefits” are overstated.

"3.13.07","Socioeconomics: Economic Modeling and Assumptions","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","DEIS Deficiency No. 2: The Socioeconomic Section of the DEIS Exaggerates the Positive Impacts of the RCM 
RCM will provide little or no financial improvement in the Superior area and will undermine the quality of life and economic future of the area. Superior will face a serious net loss and any gain will flow quickly to the large urban areas of the state. Although the DEIS provides a socioeconomic analysis that appears to suggest significant positive economic impacts in the Superior area, that analysis does not provide an accurate and balanced look at the socioeconomic impacts associated with the RCM. The socioeconomic analysis in the DEIS does not focus on Superior or the Copper Triangle. Instead it focuses on a study area that is dominated by the state’s two largest metropolitan areas, Phoenix and Tucson. See Appendix D, Deficiency No. 2, Sections 1 and 2. 
This is important because the town of Superior has 2,999 residents and the counties of Maricopa and Pima have a combined 5.5 million people. When impact analysis is done, as it was in this RCM DEIS, economic models like IMPLAN are used to measure the impact of the mine on the economies that surround the mine. Clearly the town of Superior does not have the same ability to supply the mine and the mine workers with the same breadth of goods and services as the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson can. For example, when we look at Table 3.13.4-1 in the DEIS (p. 649), we can see that 91 percent of the secondary labor income will go to areas outside of the town of Superior and 86 percent of secondary jobs will go to workers outside of the town of Superior. The reality of the proposed mine is that most of the people that will see a benefit from the mine will not be from Superior, and in large part cannot live in Superior, but will carry the vast majority of wealth that is created at the RCM out of Superior. Although all of the workers will be using many of the municipal services of Superior, they will be taking the money that they get as a mine worker back outside of the local area to spend. In addition, residents of Superior and surrounding areas who own residential property will see the value of that property decline if they live in the vicinity of whatever site is chosen for the tailings storage facility. This unfortunate reality is shown in the DEIS in Table 3.13.4-5 (page 655). In this table, it is clear that all property that is within a 5-mile radius of the proposed tailings storage facilities will suffer permanent loss of value. For three of the five action alternatives this loss of property value conservatively ranges between a little more than $3 million to a little less than $5.5 million dollars. 
It is very unlikely that the increased property values and increased housing in Superior which might result because of the proposed mine will bring an increase in property taxes for the Town. In fact, the opposite is likely to be true. What we do know is that there will be an increase in the services that Superior will have to provide because of the proposed mine and it associated activities. The increased services are currently estimated to cost Superior almost $1 million per year.
 One might assume that the town of Superior would simply be able to tap into the massive revenue stream that is predicted to come from the proposed mine in the form of various different taxes. The problem is that most of the taxes that are collected will be distributed to the cities and counties of Arizona based on population. The Town of Superior has just under 3,000 people while the state’s population is estimated at about 7 million people.
 Superior is projected to receive only a tiny portion of the total estimated taxes the RCM project would pay. The combination of the different taxes could bring the Town of Superior revenues of about $341,000 a year from “an average of between $88 and $113 million per year” (DEIS p. 650) in taxes collected from the proposed mine. As a result, there will be a shortfall that will have to be picked up by the citizens of Superior of $659,000 difference between the $1 million per year cost of services. See Appendix, Deficiency No. 2, Sections 3 and 4.
 The BBC research reported in the “Socioeconomic Effect Technical Report” laid the basis for the DEIS socioeconomic analysis. When critically analyzed, that BBC report establishes that few mine employees will live in Superior, providing little increase to Superior's tax base, while increasing the costs of municipal services. See Appendix D, Deficiency No. 2, Sections 1 and 2.

"3.13.01","Socioeconomics: General","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","DEIS Deficiency No. 3: The Socioeconomic Impacts of the Resolution Copper Mine’s High Demand for Water The DEIS does not discuss the socioeconomic impacts of the large quantities of water that will have to be imported to operate the RCM, process the ore, and transport the tailings to storage areas. This leads to an understatement of the socioeconomic disruption, i.e. costs associated with the RCM. The proposed Resolution Copper Mine (RCM) will require large quantities of “fresh” water to be imported for the mining operation. The DEIS estimates that for the Preferred Action, (Alternative 6), approximately 550,000 acre-feet of water will have to be delivered for the mining operations during the 40-year life of the mine. An acre-foot of water is approximately the amount of water that three average Phoenix metro households use in a year. The amount of water needed under the DEIS Preferred Action for the life of the mine would provide water for 1.66 million average households in the Phoenix area for a year or 166,000 households for ten years. See Appendix D, Deficiency No. 3, Section 1. In the context of regional water shortages and reductions in CAP access, it is misleading for the DEIS to mention without comment that RCM Project will “use water…directly from the Central Arizona Project (CAP) canal”. DEIS, page ES-3. The efforts by RCM to physically procure a very large amount of additional water for a new use will unavoidably drive up the price of Arizona water as well as ensure that some users will have to give up water they have used in the past. Those people are very likely to be those that cannot afford an increase in the price of water and are already the most economically stressed. The Bureau of Reclamation has announced the reduction in allocations of Colorado River water to Arizona for 2020 because of low water levels in Lake Mead. This mandated reduction of Arizona’s share of CAP water will only make RCM’s procurement of water more challenging. See Appendix D, Deficiency No. 3, Section 2. A pair of recent studies by Arizona State University concluded that the average real impact of CAP water to Arizona was about $40,000-$50,000 per acre-foot. At that rate, the loss of 15,000 af per year of water would lead to a loss of $600 to $750 million per year. Cumulatively, over a forty-year period, i.e. the life of RCM, the lost economic activity due to the reduction in CAP water available for use would be $24 to $30 billion. See Appendix D, Deficiency No.3, Section 3. Water supply in Arizona and the Lower Colorado Basin states is out of balance with water demand and has been for a relatively long time. Adjustments will have to be made. The physical reality of the shortage of water cannot be ignored. It is unlikely that the adjustment will be smooth. Different water users’ water rights have different priorities, so the impact of adjustment will fall unevenly on different individuals and organizations. In most rural areas, agriculture is not just another type of industry where workers can earn a living. It is also a way of life that is considered important to maintain and support. It has roots in the history and culture of the region. Its loss can contribute to the depopulation of rural areas and the loss of local schools and communities. Alternatively, the availability of the land can encourage ongoing ex-urban sprawl and loss of historical and cultural roots. (See Appendix D, Deficiency No. 3, Section 3.) "

The Socioeconomic Analysis in the DEIS Assumes the RCM Will Have Almost Perfectly Stable Positive Impacts on Employment and Payroll. One important explanation for the poor economic performance of local economies specializing in metal mining - despite the very high wage characteristics of that industry - is the instability of employment and income associated with mineral development activity. Arizona has had over a century of economic history with copper mining. During that time, the demands for American copper has constantly fluctuated. Over the last 110 years, at least seven major booms followed by busts occurred in which copper production fell by as much as 75 percent and most recently fell by 54 percent from 1998-2011. Those “busts” almost always involved declines of 25% to 33% or more in copper production. With those declines in copper production, of course, came declines in employment, payrolls, mine purchases of supplies, and payments of state and local taxes. The source of these declines in American copper production was the constant fluctuation in the price of copper that regularly changed the profitability of existing copper operations. These repeated fluctuations in the demand for and the price of copper led to ongoing fluctuations in copper industry employment, payroll, supply and equipment purchases, and tax payments. Analysts have come to call this irregular but ongoing instability in the economic impact of metal mining on local communities a “flicker” effec t. Arizona copper industry employment over the last forty-six years dramatically demonstrates this volatility in copper industry employment. Employment regularly increases by 5,000 to 15,000 jobs and then tumbles downward in the same dramatic way. These periodic booms and busts in copper production and employment have disruptive impacts on the communities in the vicinity of the copper mines. This volatility prevents the high wages associated with copper mining from having a reliable positive impact on local economic vitality and stability. The DEIS recognizes this: The “overview” of the socioeconomics section (3.13) ends with the statement that “Historically, mining in Arizona has followed a ‘boom and bust cycle, which potentially leads to great economic uncertainty.” (DEIS p. 640) See. Appendix D, Deficiency No. 4, Section 1. 
The DEIS, however, does not incorporate these important economic characteristics of copper mining into its analysis of socioeconomic impacts. It depicts the socioeconomic impacts associated with additional copper mining as large, stable, and positive which ignores a century of Arizona copper mining experience.
 Despite the DEIS recognizing the past volatility of Arizona copper mining, the DEIS assumes that the RCM Project will operate with perfectly stable employment and payrolls. See Appendix Deficiency No. 4, Section 2. The DEIS asserts that RCM will be able to continue operating even when international copper prices tumble downward. In projecting likely economic impacts associated with a proposed copper mine, fluctuations in production and employment similar to the historic record need to be incorporated into the projected impacts. Accurately projecting operating costs decades into the future before a mine is constructed and brought into operation is very difficult. As both the slow downs on Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia and the unexpected large volume of water in the No. 10 shaft show, the actual costs being incurred can be quite different than the General Operating Plan projected. See Appendix D, Deficiency No. 4, Section 4. 
The DEIS ignores these risks and changes in mining plans and costs while confidently projecting quite low mine production costs that are expected to last for decades. This may cheer investors, but such overly optimistic projections do not support good decision making by the public and public land managers.

Social Costs Associated with Mining The DEIS does not discuss the social disruption associated with 1,500 mining jobs being filled by in-commuting workers arriving in or leaving from Superior every day of the year. Such flows of workers into and out of small communities are known to be associated with significant social costs that undermine quality of life in small communities in the vicinity of the industrial facilities such as mines in small towns and rural areas. Not all changes that come with mining can be quantified in the same way. Some things are easy to quantify, such as the direct payments to the miners or the direct employment of the miners at the mine site. These jobs and payroll are generally the first things that are touted when a new mine is proposed in a local area. What may not be as clear are the costs to the local town of having a large, predominantly male, transient, and high paid work force come to town and then leave 365 days a year. The DEIS has not looked at some of the darker costs associated with mining towns. Some of those costs are associated with a transient work force that is not invested in the local community, increased calls to the local police, increased alcoholism, increased drug use, prostitution and trafficking, and increased domestic violence and abuse. In the Appendix, Deficiency No. 5, we provide a review of the literature that has linked mining to many of these social maladies that are often completely left out of the discussion of the potential costs to the local communities closest to the mine. Those costs are not considered and certainly not quantified in the DEIS. One should not be shocked by these findings of significant social costs associated with mines in rural areas. A large group of single, transient, males who work long hours out of sync with the local standard workday and workweek, who have a large amount of money to spend and long blocks of idle time, can be expected to be difficult to integrate into a small community. BBC Research & Consulting, who prepared the “Socioeconomic Effects Technical Report” that was the basis of the socioeconomic impact section of the DEIS, characterized the current RCM workforce in the following way: “Currently, Superior is primarily attracting the mining “transient” population, largely consisting of unmarried skilled trades workers on 3-to-4-year shifts.” (BBC, Section I, Page 14.) According to the DEIS, RCM will create about 1,500-1,600 jobs in Superior. BBC estimates that limited housing in Superior would initially lead only 10 percent of the RCM workers to choose to live in Superior. For the Town of Superior this would be a very large impact. The total workforce in Superior now is about 1,200. The number of workers in Superior would more than double from about 1,200 to about 2,800 as a result of the RCM. But the vast majority of these new workers would commute in and out of Superior each and every day as RCM schedules workers to operate mine and mine facilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. One study seeking to understand the level of substance abuse in resource-based communities, focused on the undermining of community structure and fragmentation of the populations in small mining communities: 
“Specifically, the linkages between social structure, community fragmentation, and family dysfunction offer a way of understanding differential resistance and susceptibility to substance abuse. Five thematic areas were linked to susceptibility in this study: (1) an economy based on multiple divergent sectors, which gives rise to income disparity and social inequality; (2) a highly transient population, which results in social distancing and lack of social support; (3) shift work, which prevents opportunities for consistent and productive family and community relationships; (4) high incomes, which lead to material competition and financial stress; and (5) a culture of entitlement, which produces certain expectations a nd perceived privileges among some workers and their families.”3 9 

Mining communities are likely to have all of these characteristics which at least partially explains the social costs associated with large inflows of miners into small towns and rural areas. The DEIS ignores these social costs while emphasizing the social benefits of additional high-paid jobs.

"CHAP2","Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives","CH2","Chapter 2"," No environmental analysis has been done on the two 230kV transmission line corridors that will run across USFS land. SRP and Resolution Copper are planning for major new 230kV and 69kV transmission lines and power substations for this mine project. In the Federal Register dated March 18, 2016, under “Nature of Decisions to be Made” the Forest Service contemplates issuing a special use permit or these activities. It is unclear from this language whether the Forest Service intends to exempt the power lines and substations from full EIS analysis and instead only require the special use permit alone. If so, this is improper, as the construction of these transmission lines and substations constitute major environmental actions by themselves and are also connected actions directly related to the overall mine project. The cumulative impacts from these facilities must all be fully reviewed in the revised DEIS for public review. 
This is clearly evidenced by the Resolution mining plan of operation dedicating an entire section to the provision of power for the project (section 3.5.1., in the version of the mining plan currently appearing on the Forest Service website) and also evidenced in Section 3003 of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, specifically stating that “approvals for the construction of associated power” must be included in the EIS: 
“ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. — Prior to conveying Federal land under this section, the Secretary shall prepare a single environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 25 seq.), which shall be used as the basis for all decisions under Federal law related to the proposed mine and the Resolution mine plan of operations and any related major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, including the granting of any permits, rights-of-way, or approvals for the construction of associated power, water, transportation, processing, tailings, waste disposal, or other ancillary facilities.” 
New 230kV transmission lines from the existing 115kV substation to the mine will have to be run through a new corridor or right-of-way through the Tonto National Forest and cannot be run through the existing power line right-of-way. That is because the existing 115kV lines will also need to remain in place. The Forest Service therefore must study all environmental issues associated with allowing a new power line corridor. These issues include possible impacts on existing wildlife, air and water quality, among others. The environmental impacts associated with the new, larger 230kV substation also need to be carefully studied by a full EIS. 
In a similar way, the new 69kV transmission line along the MARRCO corridor and new 69kV substation near the load out facility also need to be thoroughly studied for potential impacts to wildlife, air and water quality issues and other possible environmental impacts. This aspect of the mine project deserves a full EIS treatment.

The DEIS references Garrett, 2019, “Process Memorandum to File—Power Requirements of Mine, Mine Facilities, and Alternative Tailings Storage Facilities,” which gives maximum electricity consumption of 6.45 MW for dewatering and 6 MW for refrigeration. None of these estimates are accompanied by any explanation. "
"CHAP2","Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives","CH2","Chapter 2","                	It has been quite surprising that the 2395 pages of the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) do not include any estimate of total power requirements or any source of power (besides emergency power) except for the local grid of the Salt River Project. A previous report (Emerman, 2018) provided some insight as to why this lack of projected electricity consumption could be a concern for investors. In 2007 drilling began for the 6943-foot-deep, 28-foot-diameter No. 10 shaft, which was intended for both exploration and as the primary access point for the underground mine (E&MJ, 2014). However, in December 2012, geothermal water at a temperature of 170°F began entering the shaft at a rate of 460 gallons per minute (gpm). According to Tom Goodell, general manager – shaft development for Resolution Copper, “Productivity flattened out at 6500 feet…The consultants told us that we would have little or no water below 4000 feet…They kind of missed that call. We hit it all in one spot and it was quite dramatic” (E&MJ, 2014). The Arizona Daily Star confirmed, “Shaft-sinking equipment had reached a depth of about 6,500 feet when water from an underground aquifer began rushing in. The miners were prepared to handle 80 gallons per minute, which is what core samples from 30 feet away predicted” (Bregel, 2016). The result of the unexpected discovery was a two-year delay in drilling for the installation of upgraded pumping, refrigeration and ventilation equipment. The shaft was completed in 2014 and is now the deepest single-lift shaft in the U.S. (EM&J, 2014; Resolution Copper, 2018c). Later reports indicated that the entry rate of geothermal water into the No. 10 shaft had increased by over a factor of three to 1400 gpm and that the temperature of the geothermal water was 180°F (Bregel, 2016; Phillips, 2016). 
Neither the existence of the geothermal water, nor the additional costs associated with geothermal water, are mentioned anywhere in the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c). The geothermal water is not even mentioned in any of the discussions of regional hydrology or the potential impacts of mining upon groundwater. This is again surprising, since the document states a publication date of May 9, 2016 (title page) with an initial submittal date of November 2013 and a revision date of September 23, 2014 (page ii). The additional costs include the electricity required to dewater, refrigerate, and ventilate the mine. (Additional ventilation would be required due to the gases exsolving from the geothermal water.) An additional cost unrelated to consumption of electricity would be the cost of replacing mine equipment that is subject to corrosion by the persistent saturated atmosphere. The report by Bloomberg Businessweek (Phillips, 2016) emphasized that the latter is a real concern. According to the report, “Steaming hot water pours off the rocks…It’s like standing in a tropical rainstorm. A digital hydrometer on the wall registers 100 percent humidity” (Phillips, 2016). Emerman (2018) calculated an additional power requirement of 24 MW solely for the additional mine dewatering and refrigeration that would result from the geothermal water under a best-case scenario. The best-case scenario was based upon the following assumptions
● The flow of geothermal water into the No. 10 shaft has achieved a steady-state. 
● The aquifer has uniform transmissivity (product of aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity).
 ● The recharge rate of the aquifer does not exceed 0.1 inches per year. 
● All mine dewatering can be carried out through a single vertical pipe. 
● The mine can be refrigerated with maximum theoretical efficiency. [See letter submittal pgs 281 for additional detail]

DEIS at 59. At the outset, the “either/or” and “and/or” aspect of the water sources is unacceptable from a NEPA and public review standpoint. Resolution and the USFS have had years to develop and review this project and the DEIS must determine the sources of the water and not rely on vague assertions of possible sources.
 For all of the potential sources, the DEIS fails to analyze the environmental, economic, cultural/historical, and other impacts from removing this water. The DEIS also fails to analyze the baseline conditions of the areas that will suffer such massive water withdrawals. The DEIS’ brief mention of the groundwater removal (DEIS at 341-342) does not contain any details of the impacts from this water withdrawal on the source areas. This is despite the DEIS’ acknowledgement hat “Loss of this water from the East Salt River valley aquifer is an irretrievable impact; the use of this water would be lost during the life of the mine.” DEIS at 345.
 For example, the DEIS does some analysis of the impacts from the water withdrawal/loss at/near the mine site (albeit inadequately as shown herein), yet no analysis was done regarding the similar loss of Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDEs), wildlife habitat, etc., for the massive quantities of water removed from further-away areas. The fact that Resolution may have water rights to this water does not satisfy the USFS/Corps’ duty to fully review all of these impacts – as both connected actions under NEPA and as unavoidable cumulative impacts under NEPA.

It is unacceptable to divide a large action into a series of smaller actions or to not consider the proposed action in context with other actions taking place, called “connected actions.” Here, there can be no doubt that (a) the Mine project justifies and is the exclusive reason for Resolution’s request for a reallocation of CAP NIA Water; (b) it is both unreasonable and unwise for Resolution to develop its Mine without having secured the water supplies it needs for the Mine, which includes the CAP NIA reallocation; (c) the Mine undoubtedly triggers the request for reallocation to BOR; and (d) Resolution’s acquisition of CAP NIA is committed solely to the use of the Mine. It is therefore a connected action that must be fully reviewed in the revised DEIS. In addition, regardless of whether the Mine and other projects/activities are “connected actions,” NEPA and other laws require the agencies to review the indirect and cumulative impacts from these projects/activities.

(See Emerman’s full report in the Appendix with the same title) 
Hydrologic and geologic expert, Dr. Steve Emerman evaluated the ability of Rio Tinto to profitably operate the mine, regardless of the social and environmental impact of the mine. The objective was addressed by considering unanticipated costs, in particular, the encounter of geothermal water (180°F) in a 6943-foot-deep exploratory shaft at a flow rate of 1400 gallons per minute (gpm). The additional costs of mine dewatering and refrigeration were estimated using all best-case scenarios. The Thiem Equation for steady-state groundwater flow was used to estimate an entry rate for geothermal water of 3800 gpm for the completed mine. The Hazen-Williams Equation for pipe flow was then used to estimate a power requirement of 12 megawatts (MW) for dewatering. The theoretical maximum coefficient of performance for exchange of heat between the surface and the geothermal water was used to estimate a power requirement for refrigeration of another 12 MW. The minimum total power requirement for mine dewatering and refrigeration of 24 MW is equivalent to the average power requirement of 20,000 U.S. households. The worst-case scenario is difficult to estimate, but if more highly fractured rock is encountered during construction of the underground mine, the additional power requirements could easily be 100 times greater. Additional costs of ventilation, due to gases exsolving from the geothermal water, and corrosion of mine equipment, due to the persistent saturated atmosphere, were not considered. The most disturbing issue is the failure of the General Plan of Operations to estimate the total power requirements of the proposed copper mine or to seek any source for power besides the local grid of the Salt River Project.

Further, the DIES does not identify what other mine-related shipments will arrive by rail and whether there will be additional HAZMAT risks associated with the area. Additionally, signatories to these comments have repeatedly heard Resolution Copper officials say in public forums that the copper concentrates will be shipped from the loadout facility to a port near Guaymas, where they would be put on a ship for overseas delivery to a smelter or sent by rail to some other smelting facility. The DEIS needs to identify the route the copper would take from the loadout facility to the railroad head and the capacity of commercial rail to handle these shipments. Analysis then needs to extend to the proposed routing area. For example, east-west traffic in heavily populated Rio Rico and at more than thirty-two other major road-railway intersections will be blocked at least twice daily for the additional trains along the line between Phoenix and the border.

Downtown Nogales already has a serious problem with automobile and truck traffic due to long delays at the border for trains traveling to and from Mexico. Downtown traffic stops when a train crosses the border and there is only one bridge crossing the railroad tracks. Clearly, there would be additional traffic delays due to trains carrying concentrate. The analysis of impacts on air quality, traffic, safety, and any other relevant issues then needs to extend to the same types of issues in Nogales, Mexico and south of the border. Should the mine go forward, these types of transboundary impacts will be caused by a federally- approved action within the United States for which reasonably foreseeable effects will occur in Mexico. NEPA requires agencies to include analysis of reasonably foreseeable transboundary effects of proposed actions in their analysis of proposed actions in the United States. Officials of environmental and transportation agencies in the State of Sonora and the federal government of Mexico should be engaged in helping to provide information for this analysis.

U.S. Forest Service , 351 F.3d 1291, 1306-07 (9th Cir. 2003). The Cumulative Effects Sections are, in general, cursory. A few major projects (Pinto Valley Mine Expansion, Ripsey Wash Tailings Project) are mentioned in many Sections but discussion of probable cumulative effects is brief. The only cumulative effect noted in the “Geology Minerals and Subsidence Cumulative Effects Section is that mining may “exhaust the supply of desired rock materials….” (158). The Transportation and Access Cumulative Effects Section lists 9 projects which could each have a cumulative effect with Resolution Copper’s mine but never considers whether the combination of all 10 projects might have an impact greater than the sum of its parts. [see letter submittal pgs 294 - 299 for additional detail]"

The DEIS sets forth a set of assumptions regarding the proposed project, including, but not limited to, that the operation of the proposed project would occur over a 40-year period, that operation would be uninterrupted, that the price of copper would remain constant, and that the mine would operate at full capacity/full employment for the entire time period. Obviously this is an unreasonably overly optimistic assumption, since no mining operation has ever achieved such a constant level of production. This assumption is challenged elsewhere in these comments and should be addressed in a revised or supplemental DEIS. But if, after further analysis, the USFS comes to the conclusion that this assumption is logically appropriate, because the demand for copper is sustained at this level over the 40-year projected lifetime of the proposed project, this exceptionally strong demand for copper would clearly apply to the other Resolution Copper holding adjacent to Oak Flat -- and at a bare minimum, at least one of the additional mines would enter production during this period of time.

 Meaningful discussion and analysis of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from the loss of recreational resources at Oak Flat in the DEIS is woefully inadequate. The DEIS describes a variety of recreational uses in the Oak Flat area, but stops short of anything resembling meaningful analysis of these uses. The DEIS looks only at acreage, failing entirely to include specific, meaningful analysis of recreational use details (including things like recreational use numbers for these activities, seasonal variations in use, expected increases in recreational use due to population growth). Permanent loss of Oak Flat will push recreational users onto other areas. These direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts must be analyzed, but are conspicuously absent from the DEIS beyond a mere passing mention. 
Rock climbers, hikers, backpackers, campers, and non-motorized users also use public and private areas surrounding the mine project area including Upper and Lower Devil’s (Gaan)   Canyon. Solitude, tranquility, and outdoor features are important features to non-motorized recreational users. The recreational features on these nearby lands (which draw users) will almost certainly be impacted by dewatering, noise, dust, view degradation, subsidence and other mine impacts. The DEIS admits that in addition to the loss of recreational resources at Oak Flat, there will also be “potential loss of access to adjacent lands because movement across those areas would become prohibited.” (DEIS p. 495). This is admitted, but never analyzed. These impacts will certainly change recreational use patterns, but none of these things are studied in the DEIS.

Data is readily available from industry groups, Federal studies, and others showing that outdoor recreation is a major, growing economic contributor, both nationally and to the State of Arizona. Although estimates and methods of measurement differ, sources affirmatively conclude that outdoor recreation generates many hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer spending nationally. 40 Data also shows that outdoor recreation generated more than $21 billion in the State of Arizona alone. The DEIS should have studied the potential impacts from the losses of all recreational resources at Oak Flat from this project including trails, campsites, thousands of rock climbing routes and boulders. "
"3.9.03","Recreation: Mitigation","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation","Mitigation for the loss of recreational resources is also insufficient. The DEIS (p.498) states that one “non-discretionary measure” is that Resolution Copper is “[d]eveloping traditional and sport climbing open to the public on Resolution Copper property outside of the mining footprint through agreement with Queen Creek Coalition. Further details can be found on the Queen Creek Coalition website and the agreement with REI.” No information whatsoever appears anywhere else in the DEIS or its appendices (even Appendix J on mitigation regarding how this measure is supposedly non-discretionary, or what the contents of the agreement with REI and Queen Creek Coalition consists of (these are not on the DEIS project website, and have not been made public and not subject to comment in this DEIS).

Crossing of the Arizona Trail will “interfere with the nature and purposes of the Arizona Trail” (DEIS p. 501). This is contrary to the purpose of the legislative designation as a National Scenic Trail (16 U.S.C. § 1242(a)(2)) which specifies that scenic trails are “so located as to provide for maximum outdoor recreation potential and for the conservation and enjoyment of the nationally significant scenic, historic, natural, or cultural qualities of the areas through which such trails may pass.” Although robust, publicly available documentation exists regarding the characteristics of the Arizona Trail which is required for Scenic Trail designation under 16 U.S.C. § 1244(b), it is apparent that none of this documentation was reviewed. 
The DEIS lists only a few short-term limitations on access during construction. Long-term impacts and discussions of actual meaningful mitigation measures (and analysis of the potential effectiveness of those measures) is disappointingly inadequate. Furthermore, to the extent that mitigation to the Arizona Trail is discussed at all as a vague and non-specific promise to construct road crossings, pipeline crossings or reroutes to “minimize impediments…and visual impacts” to the Arizona Trail, this is only a voluntarily proposed and non-required measure and cannot be reasonably relied upon or analyzed as an actual mitigation plan. Additionally, the DEIS fails entirely to discuss how the potential impacts to the Arizona Trail from this project relate to the ongoing “Arizona National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan” (which is also being undertaken by the Tonto National Forest and which is anticipated being released for public comment in May 2020) – in fact, the ongoing “Arizona National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan” is not discussed or even mentioned in the DEIS, even as a reasonably foreseeable action.

"3.9.04","Recreation: Climbing","3.9","Section 3.9 - Recreation"," Impacts from the project on the adjacent, privately-owned climbing resources at Atlantis Canyon and the Pond are not studied in the DEIS. To the extent an agreement has been signed to keep these areas open (the details of which are not public), this cannot properly be considered a mitigation measure since no analysis of its effectiveness has ever been done as required by NEPA. Furthermore, the prior version of this agreement with the Access Fund for access to these areas was unilaterally revocable at any time and, since the current agreement has never been shown to the public, there is no reason to believe that it does not contain these same terms, therefore this tentative arrangement cannot possibly be considered a meaningful mitigation measure. “[O]mission of a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures would undermine the ‘action forcing’ function of NEPA. Without such a discussion, neither the agency nor other interested groups and individuals can properly evaluate the severity of the adverse effects.” Robertson v.

"IA03","Issues Analysis: General","IA","Issues Analysis","Connected Actions 
The DEIS is silent on connected actions related to the actions proposed in the DEIS. Not only does this violate NEPA, it also directly contradicted the NDAA which mandated a single EIS for all federal actions related to this project. NEPA regulations specifically require an analysis of the impact on the environment “which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.” 40 CFR § 1508.7. Thus, the fact that some of the activities will occur on private lands does not eliminate NEPA’s requirement that the Forest Service analyzed the environmental impacts of those private land activities. Indeed, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (which includes Arizona) squarely held that a federal agency is required to analyze the cumulative and connected impacts occurring on private land, even if that activity does not require federal agency approval. Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S. Forest Service , 421 F.3d 757, 815-815 (9th Cir. 2005). There, the Court specifically held that federal agencies must consider the cumulative impacts associated with off-site and private land activities. We have argued as far back as our Pre-Feasibility Drilling Plan comments in April of 2009 that the dewatering of shafts #9 & #10 shafts at the East Plant are Connected to the larger mine now being discussed in this DEIS. The Forest Service has consistently rejected that argument but now, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the Forest Service incorrectly says that the dewatering of shafts 9 & 10 are a permanent part of the no action alternative is cannot select rather than being connected to the Resolution Copper project. Similarly, The DEIS discusses briefly the need for an additional powerline corridor paralleling the MARRCO corridor, but defers a detailed analysis that is required under both NEPA and the NDAA. Likewise other powerlines feeding power to this project are mentioned but not discussed as is any real discussion of the actual route and design of pipeline and road access corridors. For that matter, all mitigation and monitoring plans outlined in the DEIS are connected actions with this project and should have been discussed in detail in this document no matter what the ownership of land underlying the proposed measure. For each of these activities, they are either connected, related, or cumulative actions which must be fully analyzed in this NEPA document.

 As noted herein, because of the DEIS’ failure to fully consider all of the project’s direct, indirect,  and cumulative impacts, as well as a complete analysis of all background/baseline conditions, the  USFS cannot ensure that the project will comply with all applicable air, water, and other  environmental standards.  
This is true whether the USFS regulates the project under its Part 228 or Part 251/262  regulations. For example, under § 251.56(a)(1)(C), the USFS must: “Require compliance with  applicable air and water quality standards established by or pursuant to applicable Federal or  State law.” The “Operator shall comply with applicable Federal and State air quality standards,  including the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857 et seq.).” 36 CFR  228.8(a); 228.8(b)(same, for water quality requirements/standards and the Clean Water Act).	    
"
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," Failure to Minimize All Adverse Environmental Impacts and Protect Public Resources  
Even under the USFS’ erroneous decision to regulate the project solely through its Part 228  regulations, the agency failed to minimize all adverse impacts, as shown herein. Under the  Organic Act and Part 228 regulations, the agency must “maintain and protect fisheries and  wildlife which may be affected by the operations.” 36 C.F.R. §228.8(e). These impacts also  violate USFS’s duties to “minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest surface  resources.” 36 C.F.R. §228.8. “The operator also has a separate regulatory obligation to ‘take all  practicable measures to maintain and protect fisheries and wildlife habitat which may be affected  by the operations.’ 36 C.F.R. §228.8(e).” Rock Creek Alliance v. Forest Service , 703 F.Supp.2d  1152, 1164 (D. Montana 2010) (mine approval violated Organic Act and 228 regulations by  failing to protect water quality and fisheries). “Under the Organic Act the Forest Service must  …require [the project applicant] to take all practicable measures to maintain and protect fisheries  and wildlife habitat.” Id . at 1170.  
The CWA, Organic Act, and agency regulations preclude USFS from approving aspects of a  mining operation that would violate federal or state water quality standards.  
”Under the Clean Water Act Section 313, the Forest Service cannot authorize  mining operations that do not comply with state and federal water quality  regulations, including a state’s antidegradation policy. 33 U.S.C. § 1323(a).”  
Save Our Cabinets v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture , 254 F.Supp.3d 1241, 1249 (D. Mont.  2017)(USFS approval of mining project violated duties under CWA and Organic Act to ensure  compliance with water quality standards). See also Hells Canyon Presv. Council v. Haines ,  2006WL2252554, *4-5 (D. Or. 2006)(USFS mine approvals violated state CWA standards).  The Organic Act mandates the same compliance, as the Part 228 regulations “further require that  mining operators comply with applicable state and federal water quality standards including the  Clean Water Act; [and] take all practicable measures to maintain and protect fisheries and  wildlife habitat.” Save Our Cabinets at 1250. The 228 regulations require that the operator  submit sufficient information to enable the agency to ensure that the Project will comply with all  applicable state and federal requirements to protect water quality and fisheries. See 36 C.F.R.  §§228.4(c)(3), 228.8(b), 228.8(e).  
In addition, regardless of whether the proper Part 251 regulations, or the improper Part 228  regulations are used, the Organic Act prevents the USFS from adversely affecting public waters,  such as the springs that will be eliminated/dewatered by the mine. DEIS at 329 (admitting that  many springs, such as Bored Spring, would be eliminated: “The loss of water to this spring  would likely lead to complete loss of this riparian area.”). These springs are covered by a federal water right. DEIS at 333 (Table 3.7.1-6. “Summary of water right filings associated with GDEs  impacted by groundwater drawdown.”).  
This is also true for the critical wetlands, riparian areas, and Groundwater Dependent  Ecosystems (GDEs) will be severely impacted by the dewatering. DEIS at 304 (noting USFS  Manual 2520). See also DEIS at 315, Figure 3.7.1-7 (“Groundwater-dependent ecosystems of  concern.”)(showing GDE springs to be dewatered). In addition to the Executive Order on  Wetlands Protection (which requires the USFS to protect wetlands), the Organic Act requires the  USFS to protect public land water resources, which has not been done.  
”[N]ational forests …shall be as far as practicable controlled and  administered in accordance with the following provisions. No national forest  shall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the  boundaries, or for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows,  and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens  of the United States.”  
16 U.S.C. §475. “The legislative debates surrounding the Organic Administration Act of 1897  and its predecessor bills demonstrate that Congress intended national forests to be reserved for  only two purposes – ‘to conserve the water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber  for the people.’” U.S. v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 707 (1978). 42 “The objects for which the  forest reservations should be made are the … preservation of forest conditions upon which water  conditions and flows are dependent.” Id . at 708.  
New Mexico recognized that the “preservation” of conditions for water flow was aimed  primarily at providing water for uses outside the forest boundaries – contradicting the agency’s  position here that it has no authority over actions on the forests that may eliminate or impair  off-forest resources. “Congress authorized the national forest system principally as a means of  enhancing the quantity of water that would be available to the settlers of the arid West.” New  Mexico , 438 U.S. at 713. Yet instead of “enhancing” water supplies, the dewatering will  eliminate hundreds of millions of gallons of water each year that would otherwise be available to  downstream water users, including federal water rights.4 3 
Although the Act itself and New Mexico shows that the agency’s abdication of authority here is  invalid, this does not mean that mining is precluded whenever they effect downstream water  supplies. “Congress intended the national forests to be put to a variety of uses … not  inconsistent with the two principle purposes of the forests .” Id . at 716 (emphasis added).  
The fact that USFS’s failure to “preserv[e] forest conditions upon which water conditions and  flows are dependent” stems from groundwater dewatering/pumping instead of direct removal of  surface waters, does not eliminate this aspect of the Organic Act. Federal authority to protect  reserved water rights inherent in a federal reservation (such as an Indian reservation or national  forest) embodies both surface water and the groundwater connected to the surface flow. The  Ninth Circuit recently affirmed this connection, focusing on the key issue – whether groundwater  is needed to meet a primary purpose of the reservation. In Agua Caliente , the court held that “if  the purposes underlying a reservation envision access to water,” than that includes protecting  both surface and appurtenant groundwaters. 849 F.3d at 1270. “‘[T]he United States can protect  its water from subsequent diversion, whether the diversion is of surface or groundwater.’  [ Cappaert , 426 U.S. at 143]. If the United States can protect against groundwater diversions, it  follows that the government can protect the groundwater itself.” Aqua Caliente , at 1271.  
Here, USFS never considered whether its approval of the project is “consistent with” one of the  “primary purposes” of the Coronado National Forest – “enhancing” and “preserving” water  conditions/flows  
In addition, no mitigation is proposed/analyzed to protect the Forest Service’s own water rights  on its lands. USFS must ensure that federal water rights are not impaired or used by private  interests to the detriment of the purposes for which the rights were acquired or created. Federal  water rights are “superior to the rights of future appropriators.” Cappaert , 426 U.S. at 138.  “[T]he United States can protect its water from subsequent diversion, whether the diversion is of  surface or groundwater.” Id . at 143. “Where reserved rights are properly implied, they arise  without regard to equities that may favor competing water uses. See Cappaert v. U.S. , 426 U.S.  128, 138-39.” Colville Confederated Tribes v. Walton , 752 F.2d 397, 405 (9 th Cir. 1985). 
The USFS cannot disregard its duty to protect such federal property. “Only Congress, and not an  executive branch agency, can authorize the disposition of federal property.” High Country  Citizens Alliance v. Norton , 448 F.Supp.2d 1235, 1248 (D. Colo. 2006), citing Gibson v.  Chouteau , 80 U.S. 92, 99 (1871). The court in High Country found that the Interior Department  failed to protect federally reserved waters to the detriment of its reserved right. Id. at 1253. See  also Lake Berryessa Tenants’ Council v. U.S. , 588 F.2d 267, 271 (9 th Cir. 1978)(federal agency  “cannot by their conduct cause the Government to lose its valuable rights by their acquiescence,  laches, or failure to act.”).  
The fact that Arizona has yet to formally adjudicate these rights does not mean that they do not  exist or deserve protection. In Cappaert , no decree or even quantification of water was necessary  for the Supreme Court to conclude the federal reserved water right was impacted. 426 US at  133-134. The federal government is under an obligation to protect federal water rights, despite  the fact that “the State of Montana was in the process of determining water rights within the  state, an undertaking expected to consume many years.” Joint Board of Control of the Flathead,  Mission, and Jocko Irrigation Districts v. United States , 832 F.2d 1127, 1130 (9 th Cir. 1987). The  Circuit emphasized the agency’s “duty” to protect the reserved water flows. Id . at 1132.  
"
"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," Illegal Amendment of Forest Plan  
The DEIS is also under the mistaken belief that the USFS must amend the Tonto National Forest  Plan:  
”A consistency review between the GPO and the current forest plan indicates that  approval and eventual implementation of the GPO would result in changed  conditions that are inconsistent with existing forest plan direction. Approval of the  GPO would therefore require a project-specific forest plan amendment to modify  one or more plan components, i.e., standards and guidelines. The scope and scale  of the necessary forest plan amendment would be narrow in scope and scale, i.e.,  limited to the GPO project area; and limited to the substantive rule provisions at  §219.10 that are directly related to the amendment.”  
DEIS at 10. See also DEIS at 12 (Table 1.4.3-1, “Forest Plan amendments for the Resolution  Copper Project and Land Exchange.”).  
That is wrong. First, this relies on the mistaken view that the agency’s authority over the project  is limited to reviewing the GPO. Second, the agency is prohibited from amending the Forest  Plan if it would violate its duties under the Organic Act to protect the forest from destruction and  depredations. Although the agency does not have the authority to deny the land exchange (assuming that all other laws are met, which as noted herein is not the case), it certainly has the  authority, and duty, to protect public resources affected by the mine (which the agency does not  have to approve).  
Thus, the proposed Forest Plan amendments violate the Organic Act and the National Forest  Management Act. This is also true because under the NFMA, the agency cannot amend a Forest  Plan unless the amendment is supported by a legally-adequate EIS, which as shown herein, has  not been done.

"
"3.12.01","Cultural Resources: Cultural History","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","Apaches see Oak Flat differently - it is a church, a place for worship and the practice of  our traditional religion. It is the center of our most sincerely held, religious beliefs, where  diyf'(sacred power) can be called upon via prayers. Oak Flat is the goiff'(home) of our diyi'n,  visited by our ga 'an (spiritual beings) who provide us with healing and spiritual services. It is  also a place that speaks to the very essence of tribal culture.  
Covering 4,309 acres, Oak Flat lies within the traditional territory of the T'iis Tseban (the  ""cottonwood trees gray among rocks people""), also known as the ""Pinal Band"" of Apaches, and  is closely associated with the related Tse Binesti 'e (the ""surrounded by rocks people""), also  known as the Aravaipa Band. At least eight Apache clans have direct ties to this location. Tribal  members continue to visit Oak Flat for prayer and a wide range of traditional needs and  practices. The ethnographic and ethnohistoric study of the area surrounding Oak Flat, conducted  by Anthropological Research, LLC, at the request of the Tonto National Forest, identifies 404  traditional cultural properties of at least nine tribes with traditional ties to the area.  
For at least a half millennium through to the present day, members of our Tribe have  utilized the Oak Flat area for traditional religious ceremonies, such as the Sunrise Dance, where  we celebrate the event of a girl's maturation from puberty over four days, through dance,  drumming, song and prayer, and the visitation of Crown Dancers. It is a place where Apache  Holy Ground rituals occur, where we commune with and sing to our Creator God, and celebrate  our holy spirits, including our mountain spirits, the Ga'an. It is a place filled with rock paintings  and petroglyphs, what some may describe as the footprints and the very spirit of our ancestors,  hallmarks akin to the art found in gothic cathedrals and temples, like the Western Wall in  Jerusalem, St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, or Angor Wat in Cambodia. This is why I call  Oak Flat the Sistine Chapel of Apache religion.  
Oak Flat is also a burial ground, a holy cemetery. Recently, using cadaver dogs, an effort  which was not done with the approval of tribes, the Forest Service found the remains of up to  100 bodies, many of whom were most likely our Apache Ancestors. The echoes of their  encampments still reverberate with the outlines of wikiups, lava rock structures, metate stones  for grinding foodstuffs, and other tools and artifacts.  
Oak Flat is also a place where our members still conduct traditional harvesting of plants  important to our diet, such as acorns from Emory oaks, and healing plant-based medicines for a  wide range of ailments.  
As you have personally witnessed, it is a pristine, bucolic oasis of many varied plants and  animals that depend on Oak Flat's waters. Water is very scarce in Arizona. Pinal County  predicts an 8.1 million acre foot deficit in its water supply. And yet, Oak Flat is a place of water,  what Apaches call tu. The water in the area plays an integral role in our traditional religion and  ceremonies. Oak Flat is also full of seeps, some 46 springs, and a number of streams and ponds  form an integral part of the region's weather system and the formation of ancient aquifers, like  the Apache Tuff, which lies below the Town of Superior and supplies the town's municipal  water system, and the Queen Creek community.  
The area surrounding Superior, Arizona, as well as Oak Flat, Apache Leap and Ga'an  Canyon, was also the area where mining interests and the press ignited vigilante, genocidal,  militias and military campaigns between 1859 and 1874 that killed over 380 Pinal Apaches including  many women and children - and resulted in the confining of survivors in a prisoner of  war camp known as Old San Carlos.  
For all of these reasons and factors, Oak Flat was listed in the U.S. National Register of  Historic Places. Yet, if it becomes operational, the Resolution Copper Mine will swallow up and  completely destroy Oak Flat in its entirety - all of the historic, cultural properties, our burial  ground, our place of worship, our church, and the foundation of our traditional religious beliefs.  Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and the Forest Service each admit this wholesale destruction will occur.

DEIS page ES-3 finds that “the expected significant environmental impacts and loss of the Oak Flat area, historically used by Native Americans who hold the land as sacred and use the area for spiritual and traditional uses.”11 The DEIS also lists some of the tribes’ concerns, including “access routes, air, groundwater and surface water, plant and animal life, and landscapes, as well as less tangible attributes such as sense of place; sense of historical, spiritual, and tribal identity; opportunities for solitude; and opportunities to continue traditional cultural practices and ceremonies.”12 The DEIS recites mandates to analyze “how cumulative resource disturbance impacts tribal values and spiritual practices…. [and the] number of sacred springs or other discrete sacred sites that would be impacted, and potential effects on Native Americans from the desecration of land, springs, burials, and sacred site [and] Estimated acres of traditional resource collection areas that would be impacted.”13 But, these paltry references do not address the depth and breadth of the irreparable harms that tribes will suffer.

"3.12.01","Cultural Resources: Cultural History","3.12","Section 3.12 - Cultural Resources","Even more to the point and despite NEPA’s core mandate to document the human environment, the DEIS fails disclose the unassailable truth that the land and mineral wealth proposed for transfer to RCM belonged to the affected tribes 150 years ago, and that these resources were taken by force and with the loss of many of our ancestors. The DEIS should have referenced and discussed essential facts, including at a minimum: 
• The proposed RCM impact area was under Native American control, and later claimed by Spain and Mexico until the 1848 treaty that ended the Mexican- American War (Spicer 1962). 
• In the 1852 Treaty of Santa Fe14 that followed the end of the U.S. war with Mexico, the U.S. Government formally recognized the domain of the Western and Chiricahua Apache Nations as extending from what would become central Arizona eastward to the Rio Grande. That Treaty obliged the Apaches to live exclusively under U.S. laws and jurisdiction and obligated the U.S. to “designate, settle, and adjust [the Apaches] territorial boundaries, and ... legislate and act as to secure the permanent prosperity and happiness of said Indians” (Kappler, 1904). 
• Royce (1899: 922-923) on Map AZ 1, provides an authoritative depiction of the non-exclusive domain of Western and Chiricahua Apaches.15 That map includes the RCM impact area within the Apache domain covered by the 1852 Treaty of Santa Fe. 
• Despite the signed treaty and early cooperation between Apaches and the U.S. Government and the U.S. Government trust responsibilities for American Indians, various U.S. Government and Arizona Territorial Government policies and actions unlawfully abetted non-Indian encroachments onto the lands of Apaches and other Native American nations (Basso 1983; Ogle, 1970; Spicer 1962; Thrapp 1967). 
• The U.S. Indian Claims Commission (“ICC”) generally determined the boundaries of aboriginal lands of the affected tribes. Figure 1 below depicts the boundaries of aboriginal lands of the affected tribes.16 [Footnotes: 14 See Attachment One, Tribal Stewardship. 15 See Attachment Two, Tribal Stewardship. 16 See Attachment Three, Tribal Stewardship.]
[See comment letter for figure. Figure caption: Figure 1. Boundaries of affected Tribes’ Aboriginal Territories.] Figure 2 below is a higher resolution depiction of the aboriginal lands in the vicinity of the RCM project impact area.17 Figure 2 establishes that the DEIS proposed RCM project would have direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the aboriginal lands of Arizona’s Apache, Yavapai, and Pima-O’odham tribes and nations.
 [Footnote: 17 See Attachment Four, Tribal Stewardship.] [See comment letter for figure. Figure caption: Figure 2. Boundaries of affected Tribes’ Aboriginal Territories overlapping with the RCM impact area.] 
In the early 1870s, Western Apaches relinquished about millions of acres of their aboriginal lands in exchange for reduced acres on reservation lands and U.S. Government guarantees of protection and assistance (Welch, 2016, pp. 82-88). Two additional maps18 attached to these comments depict the results of U.S. Government closures of several Apache reservations and severances of more than 2,000,000 acres from the White Mountain and San Carlos reservations from 1873–1902. These facts are specifically relevant to assessments of the human environment and tribal values and concerns for the RCM project impact area because the U.S. Government effectively donated these tracts of Apache Reservation lands to non-Apache miners, farmers, and ranchers for industrial uses. In the latter 1800s and early 1900s, and in the 2015 NDAA Section 3003, justice-driven governance was trumped by profit-driven promises by miners. 
[Footnote: 18 See Attachments Five and Six, Tribal Stewardship.]
 ICC Findings of Fact for Docket 22-D (Indian Claims Commission 1969) and Docket 22-E (Indian Claims Commission 1965) confirm the facts listed above and provide other court-confirmed facts directly relevant to understanding the historical context of the human environment of the RCM impact area. The authoritative compendium of historical and cultural facts provided by the U.S. Smithsonian Institution is directly relevant to the human environment impacted by the RCM project. (Ortiz 1983). Nevertheless, the DEIS ignored such authority. The DEIS ignored the above-cited facts. The DEIS has not meaningfully acknowledged, much less analyzed, the human environment or the impacts of this project in these essential terms. Based on these facts and authorities, the DEIS should have provided the historical context for documenting the proposed RCM project impact area and for analyzing and assessing those impacts on cultural resources, tribal values, and tribal communities.

The Tribe has corresponded with the Forest Service and provided testimony to the U.S. Congress, regarding the preeminence of Oak Flat and its surrounding areas on our religious beliefs and values. Of all the concerns expressed by the Tribe, the impact of the proposed RCM project on the traditional religion and values of San Carlos Apache members is the most central and harmful, on a scale of cumulative effects so devastating that it cannot be completely described in English. 
Despite all of the Tribe’s careful, detailed documentation of the potential impacts on our people by the proposed mine project, the DEIS and, by extension, the Forest Service, have failed to sufficiently identify and discuss the profound religious significance of Oak Flat and surrounding areas to San Carlos Apaches and our relatives within the Western Apaches. Chapters 3.12 (Cultural Resources) and 3.14 (Tribal Values and Concerns) of the DEIS, provide mere lip service to the terms “cultural” and “tribal values and concerns”. The DEIS offers no serious or comprehensive explanation of the integral role that Oak Flat and its surroundings areas have on our traditional religion, now and for hundreds of years in the past. Worse, the Forest Service’s approach is that the proposed mine is a fait accompli – that nothing can or will be done to address the immediate, irreparable and incalculable harms that will be permanently perpetrated upon the Tribe’s traditional religion and values. All this without regard for federal government’s statutory obligations or trust responsibility to Western Apaches and our Tribe. 
Leaders of our Tribe have testified before Congress to express the religious and sacred significance of Oak Flat to our people. On November 1, 2007, former Chairman Wendsler Nosie, Sr. presented testimony on H.R. 3301, the 2007 iteration of the Land Exchange Act, before the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands.20 Among other things, he described Oak Flat, Apache Leap, and Devil’s Canyon as holy and sacred sites for San Carlos Apaches. 
”For as long as may be recalled, our [Apache] People have come together here. We gather the acorns and plants that these lands provide, which we use for ceremonies, medicinal purposes, and for other cultural reasons. We have lived throughout these lands, and the Apache People still come together at Oak Flats and Apache Leap to conduct religious ceremonies and to pray or take rest under the shade of the ancient oak trees that grow in the area. The importance of these lands has not changed. These are holy, sacred, and consecrated lands which remain central to our identity as Apache People.21” 
Our Tribe’s leaders have testified before Congress on other occasions over the years always identifying the sacredness and sanctity of Oak Flat and the surrounding special places to our Western Apache People.22 The eloquence of our Tribal Elders is poignant and is important for shedding light and understanding on the spiritual importance of places like Oak Flat.23 The Memorandum to the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Tribal Council on the subject of Sacred Sites in general and Oak Flat in particular signifies the singular import of sanctity and spirituality Chi’chil Biłdagoteel. 
There are many sacred and holy sites throughout our traditional lands, on and off the Reservation. These are natural places filled with power, and we go to them (or invoke them in our prayer) for a variety of reasons: for prayers and ceremonies, to get healing and ceremonial items, or for peace and personal cleansing. These places are best known by the families whose ancestors originate from the areas in which these sites are located. There are so many of these holy places that no one person knows them all. We usually best know about the sites from the area our family comes from. * * * 
Oak Flat is one of these sacred places. We call it Chich’il Biłdagoteel. The ancestors of some of our Tribal members lived there, and passed their knowledge to their descendents who are alive today. The Oak Flat area and everything in it belongs to powerful Diyin who we respect. The people have always held dances and healing ceremonies, and gathered food, medicinal plants, and many other healing items there. To this day some of us go to some of the holy places within Oak Flat area for prayer and healing.24 
The DEIS fails to provide any description of the traditional religious role that Oak Flat and its surrounding areas has for San Carlos Apaches in everyday life. The Forest Service is well aware of the traditional religious roles and values of Oak Flat and its environs. The DEIS should include a comprehensive, detailed description of the meaning and significance that Oak Flat represents to our Tribe and Western Apaches. This would be a simple sign of respect to our people. This is particularly vital given that this mining project will result in the Oak Flat Withdrawl Area, its environment, the plants and animals, its waters, and all the sacred places within being completely destroyed by the mine’s subsidence resulting from the proposed blockcave mining method. The words “harm” and “destroyed” do not describe the sheer violence that will be perpetrated by this mine. 
Most tragically, the living spiritual being of Oak Flat and its attendant Ga’an and Diyin will withhold their presence and healing services to Apaches. It will prevent our access to them, and remove a part of the very heart and soul of what it is to be an Apache. These are all facts to Apaches and the impacts on Apaches, our life, our culture, our soul – all remain undescribed by the DEIS. This very paragraph does not even begin to provide a description of the harm that would be perpetrated.

"3.14.03","Tribal Values and Concerns: Traditional Cultural Properties and Cultural Landscapes","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns"," Elements of Apache Traditional Religion On Ga’an and Diyin25 
Apache religion is a highly ordered suite of patterned thoughts and actions grounded, like most or all religions, in precepts about the origin and development of the universe and the character and interrelations of objects and entities within it. (Basso 1983). The stark contrasts between Apache and Western metaphysical precepts help to explain the conflict over Chi’chil Biłdagoteel (Oak Flat) and the proposed RCM project. Previous attempts on the part of US Federal and Arizona governments and industrial boosters to characterize Apaches as “primitive” and “savage” (see, for example, Legislature of the Territory of Arizona 1871) have been debunked as misguided racist fabrications. (see Welch 2016, 2017). In fact, despite centuries of oppression and persecution, Apaches have created and have maintained a vast and intricate mythology (Goodwin 1939), an extensive complex of elaborate and compelling prayers, chants, and rituals (Goodwin 1938; Basso 1970), a set of sophisticated theories of natural and supernatural causality (Basso 1970), and a vast and intricately named and storied landscape, one populated and animated by subtle and profound natural and supernatural entities and significances. (Basso 1996). 
Traditional Apache religion makes unique and fundamental contributions to the development and sustenance of personal and collective identity and well-being. (Basso 1969, 1970, 1983). The persistent importance of traditional religious thought and practice among Apaches today and into their future as a unique Indigenous people cannot be overemphasized. 
According to traditional Apache religious thought and practice, everything that exists is a manifestation of its specific form of life (bí'íhí'na). All plants, animals, minerals, waters, and the earth itself has bí'íhí'na, as do fire, wind, lightning, thunder, rainbows, and an extensive group of supernatural beings (Diyin) that are seldom seen by humans. All these forms of life are distinct and all are distinctively different from one another and from human life. All are intrinsically, though in varying degrees, “holy” or “sacred” (godiyíí). (Goodwin 1938; Basso 1970, 1983). 
Because all life forms are godiyíí they possess their distinctive forms of sacred power (diyí’). Diyí’ can be called upon via prayers and chants by religious practitioners who have received training and demonstrated respect for the natural world in general and the life forms possessing the required or desired diyí’. (Goodwin 1938; Basso 1970). Different powers are called upon for different reasons, for example, to afford protection from dangers, to heal specific illnesses, to facilitate success in particular endeavors, to celebrate female puberty, and for other purposes. (Goodwin 1938; Basso 1969, 1970, 1983). 
The existence of diyí’ is the fundamental rationale for Apache demonstrations of “respect” (dińłsįh). Failure to display deference and dińłsįh causes the diyí’ to withhold benefits to supplicants. (Basso 1970, 1983). Respect may be shown through simple avoidance and mercy, by refraining from taking any life unless it is required to sustain oneself or one’s kin, and by avoidance of causing any damage to the “home” (goiíí’) of the diyí’. For many Apaches and all practitioners of traditional Apache religion, active respect and avoidance of damage ensures stability and harmony. (Basso 1983). 
Because they provide the goiíí’ (homes) of and for the diyí’ (sacred power) and Diyin (sacred beings), certain types of places – especially mountains, springs, unique landforms, and concentrations of what Westerners call biodiversity – are closely associated with holiness, sacredness. Forms of life with homes in these places are said to “belong” to that spring, mountain, or landform. Although a particular landform may itself possess great diyí’, as is certainly the case with Chi’chil Biłdagoteel, it is the unique combination and integration of all associated diyí’ and Diyin that defines its sacred significance. 
Specific places have and transcendent importance in traditional Apache religion. Apaches have, on the basis of centuries of close observations, respectful uses, and spiritual exchanges with places, developed conceptions of places, place-related powers, and place-linked sacredness. Certain places are the only available host for specific ceremonies. Certain other places provide plant, animal, water, and mineral resources required for ceremonials. Other specific places command respect because of associations with important supernatural events or processes or because they are the resting places of deceased persons. (Goodwin 1938, 1939; Basso 1983). Chi’chil Biłdagoteel is a sacred place for all of these reasons, a locality of unique and uniquely profound significance. If Oak Flat is destroyed then with it will be destroyed unique, centrally important, and irreplaceable aspects of traditional Apache religion. 
Among the important implications of the facts that places are endowed with specific and often unique forms of sacred significance is that different places are not interchangeable for essential purposes in traditional Apache religion. Many spiritual and ritual observances cannot occur except in designated places. Particular plants, minerals, and animals required for specific ceremonials must be collected only at certain places. Particular sacred power must be invoked with prayers and chants that mention only the names of places that provide these diyí’ and Diyin with homes. Because of these proscriptions the Apache landscape resonates with profoundly moral dimensions that sacred places symbolize and embody. 
In light of the foregoing, it is understandable that damage to or destruction of sacred places, especially intentional destruction in pursuit of monetary gain or personal status enhancement, is regarded as repugnant and deeply immoral. One of Keith Basso’s most knowledgeable and articulate Apache consultants, Nick Thompson, made this point in clear and compelling terms: 
“If you hurt one of these holy places, it’s very, very bad. You will hurt yourself and all your people if you do that. You must always show respect and take care of those holy places. Each one helps us in some way. We depend on them to help us live right, to live the way we should. So we leave them alone except when we really need them. We pray to them to help us. If we hurt them they would stop helping us – and we would only know trouble.” (Basso field notes on file, White Mountain Apache Tribe Historic Preservation Office, Whiteriver, Az.)” 
Jacob Henry, an enrolled member of the White Mountain Apache Tribe and a Tribal Monitor employed by the Forest Service’s Tribal Monitoring Program, agreed to speak to employees of the Tribe’s Department of Justice (DOJ). Mr. Henry consented to provide the DOJ with an affidavit.26 Mr. Henry described his work with the Tribal Monitoring Program.27 Mr. Henry stated under oath that on two specific occasions at distinct locations he “had a sensation come over me, a sensation I had felt in church” and that other persons who were present also “had a very deep, personal, powerful, spiritual connection to a presence we could not see, but could feel.”28 He described feeling overwhelmed by the presence he felt. 29 Ms. Lyndon was one of the person who also had a deep, powerful, spiritual connection, and was observed by Mr. Henry as weeping on the occasion.30  [Footnotes: 25 The Source Materials for this section of the comment are in Attachment Five, Religious Significance. 26 See Attachment Six, Religious Significance, Affidavit of Jacob Henry. 27 Id. ¶¶ 7, 8, 12, 16 -18. 28 Id, ¶¶ 20-21, 23, 29 Id. ¶ 23. 30 Id. ¶ 20.]

"NP09","NEPA: Tribal Consultation","NP","NEPA Process"," The Forest Service has failed to consult with tribes in the manner prescribed by NEPA, NHPA, and NDAA Section 3003(c)(3).32 Contrary to the assertions made by Forest Service that a three-track approach is appropriate, the consultation process required by the NDAA § 3003(c)(3) envisions an interconnected consultation process with the affected tribes. Consultation with Tribes must comply with the NHPA and NEPA. 
The Forest Service is required to engage in government-to-government consultation with Indian Tribes.33 The Forest Service failure to consult is a matter of record, not opinion. The DEIS fails to reflect the results of previous consultations with the Tribe because it effectively has ignored virtually every concern and request conveyed in our July 2016 scoping comments. The DEIS also fails in numerous ways to support consultation efforts. The DEIS ignores the interrelations between the sociocultural and biophysical impacts of the proposed RCM. The Programmatic Agreement (PA) included in the DEIS (version 5) completely discounted and disregarded the Tribe’s comments on the prior draft. 
In the spring of 2016, after many months of deliberations to create a mutually acceptable memorandum of understanding between the Tribe and Forest Service to guide consultations pursuant to NDAA 3003 (c)(3) and related authorities, Forest Service eviscerated the previously agreed upon draft MOU. The DEIS points to the Forest Service’s consultation efforts made pursuant to NHPA Section 106 as a showing that it has met its burden for consultation. Yet, this effort ignores all of the other RCM specific mandates in NDAA Section 3003(c)(3). The Forest Service has, in effect, put all its consultation “eggs” in a NHPA “basket” – an arbitrary, capricious, and poorly executed decision.

My letter to the Forest Service of January 17, 2017, recites events and positions by Forest Service personnel which sadly foreshadowed events which are occurring today.38 It is perhaps because the Forest Service has maintained an attitude that the Land Exchange is a foregone conclusion regardless of the recklessness of proceeding with the RCM project that such an off-hand and casual approach has been taken toward consultation with the Tribe. 
The Tribe has repeatedly corresponded with the Forest Service regarding the deficiencies in the consultation process.39 The correspondence in Attachment Two of this section reflect only a portion of the writings between us which reflect a lack of meaningful consultation. The recent special Council meeting hosted by the Tribe clearly failed to qualify as meaningful consultation.40 The Forest Service has expressly communicated to our Tribe during the special Council meeting that the Forest Service has no decision-making authority with respect to the proposed RCM mining project, meaning that the agency cannot deny the Land Exchange as an alternative under the DEIS.41 Several questions went unanswered during the Council meeting and Forest Service did not have the personnel who could respond to questions regarding the PA. 
Cultural resource issues and concerns are explicitly recognized in the NDAA.42 Our Tribe has clearly established that the Forest Service has failed to comply with the NHPA and Section 3003(c)(3)(A). The Tribe has a number of issues of concern listed in the Tribe’s Scoping Statement and raised here which the Forest Service has failed to enter into any consultation process mandated by Section 3003(c)(3).

"3.14.03","Tribal Values and Concerns: Traditional Cultural Properties and Cultural Landscapes","3.14","Section 3.14 - Tribal Values and Concerns","the Forest Service is not relieved of its duty to analyze whether federal laws that protect religious liberty of all Americans, including San Carlos Apaches. The Forest Service made no such analysis in the DEIS. 
In 1993, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et. seq.) (“RFRA”), and confirmed that “the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution.”43 As an agency of the United States, Forest Service is obligated to carry-out the provisions of RFRA, as the RCM project will impact the religion of San Carlos Apaches.44 
Under RFRA, “government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person (1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of further that compelling governmental interest.”45 
RFRA’s definition of “exercise of religion” was amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (Pub. L. 106-274, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq) (“RLUIPA”).46 RLUIPA states, “[t]he term ‘religious exercise’ includes any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”47 To qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted religious belief must be sincere.48 
The “exercise of religion” involves “not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts” that are “engaged in for religious reasons.”49 Practices that are compelled or limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within RLUIPA’s definition.50 Courts have considered important writings, gathering places, and ceremonies and rituals as practices of religion for purposes of identifying the exercise of religion.51 
With respect to important writings, “most religions embrace seminal, element, fundamental, or sacred writings. These writings often include creeds, tenets, precepts, parables, commandments, prayers, scriptures, catechisms, chants, rites, or mantras.”52 As to gathering places, “many religions designate particular structures or places as scared, holy, or significant. These sites often serve as gather places for believers. They include physical structures, such as churches, mosques, temples, pyramids, synagogues, or shrines; and natural places, such as springs, rivers, forests, plains, or mountains.”53 Additionally, “most religions include some form of ceremony, ritual, liturgy, sacrament, or protocol. These acts, statements, and movements are prescribed by the religion and are imbued with transcendent significance.”54 
The significance of Oak Flat and the documented cultural sites, songs, prayers, spiritual beings, and ceremonial sites confirms that Oak Flat hold significant religious meaning to San Carlos Apaches, thus illustrating the sincere and central religious principles of San Carlos Apaches. Such religious practices, as confirmed by the Ethno Study, has been well-documented as a practice of Apaches for hundreds of years. Today, Apache People still come together at Oak Flats and Apache Leap to conduct religious ceremonies and to pray, a ritual that stems from the ancestors of Apaches, which are holy and sacred, and remain central to the identity of Apache People. There are writings on the rocks at Oak Flat along with human remains and burials of materials and items of Apache Crown Dancers, the most powerful, spiritual protector of Apaches. 
Young Apache girls who reach woman-hood go to Oak Flat to have their traditional Apache Sunrise Dance ceremony, a rite that entails the family of the young girl selecting a man and woman from the Apache community to serve as traditional god-parents to young Apache girl. This ritual entails the ceremony being performed for four-days, a number sacred to Apaches but also includes weeks of labor to put a traditional campsite together. This has been performed at Oak Flat since time immemorial. These young girls, as they progress in age and become wiser, always return to Oak Flat. That’s the Apache way subject to irreparable harm that would derive, imposing severe consequences of Apache religion at Oak Flat, as a result of block-caving mining. 
A government action that puts a religious practitioner to the choice of engaging in conduct that seriously violations his/her religious beliefs or facing serious consequences constitute a substantial burden for purposes of RFRA.55 “Certain aspects of religious exercise cannot, in any way, be restricted or burdened by either federal or state legislation.”56 The freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute.57 
No greater burden exists than the harm that will result on Apache religion as a result of Oak Flat being destroyed due to the proposed block-cave mining method, causing Oak Flat to subside and forcing San Carlos Apaches to violate the tenets of their religion. The testimony presented by the San Carlos Apache Tribe explains the central role that Oak Flat has with the religion of San Carlos Apaches and how there is no other site that Apaches can go to practice certain ceremonies, songs, and rituals only available at Oak Flat. 
When determining whether a substantial burden on the exercise of religion is in urtherance of a compelling governmental interest, the court must look beyond broadly formulated interests and scrutinize the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.58 RFRA contemplates a “more focused inquiry.”59 It “requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.60 This requires courts to “loo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests” and to “scrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants” – in other words, to look to the marginal interest.61 
The Forest Service does not have a compelling government interest in developing and operating a copper mine. Rather the Forest Service is a facilitator following the law it is required to perform. It would be irrational to argue that the Forest Service, a federal land management agency would be compelled to develop and operate a mine which will destroy the very land it is tasked to manage. 
The least restrictive means standard is exceptionally demanding, which requires the governments to show that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting party.62 “[I]f a less restrictive means is available for the Government to achieve its goals, the Government must use it.”63 This standard has no application because the Forest Service has no compelling government interest.

There needs to be additional published, peer reviewed analyses of the alternative mining methods that were deemed infeasible, stating why they were not considered in the DEIS. I believe the safest way to move forward would be to extract the ore in such a way that would allow near-simultaneous back filling, to minimize surface expression and stabilize the subsurface; and that this should be evaluated as an alternative in the DEIS. If cost was a driving factor in eliminating alternatives, which in my experience is typically the case, were those costs balanced against the current value of copper, an average, was the future value of copper considered, etc? Is the evaluation of economics related to revenue and profits for Resolution Copper analyzed and disclosed in the DEIS for each alternative? Were alternatives eliminated because the technology is not there yet? In either case, as mining has been conducted for centuries, if it's not cost effective or the technology has not been developed yet you wait until one of those (or both) come true.

International law protects the right of Native American religious practitioners to maintain and practice their religious traditions in relation to sacred areas.64 Among the principle sources of international law are treaties entered into by independent States. International treaties are part of federal law, inasmuch as the United States Constitution, Article VI, Section 2, provides that treaties made under the authority of the United States are the “supreme law of the land,” and binding on the “Judges in every state.”65 Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has noted that “[i]nternational law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction.”66 
The international treaties that are particularly relevant here are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights67 and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.68 The United States ratified the Covenant in 199269 and the Convention two years later in 1994. 
The right to practice or manifest religion or belief is protected under Article 18(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that “[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion [which includes] freedom…either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.”70 In addition, Article 27 of the Covenant, which is of relevance to indigenous peoples, gives special consideration to the rights of minorities whose cultural and religious traditions differ from those of the majority.71 Article 27 states, “Persons belonging to minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion.”72 
Besides the Covenant, Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination provides that State parties are to “guarantee the right of everyone…to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of…[t]he right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.73 In interpreting and applying this Convention, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (“the Committee”), which monitors compliance with the treaty, has observed the need to take into account the particular characteristics of diverse groups in order to achieve effective equality in enjoyment of their human rights.74 The Committee has noted the distinctive characteristics of indigenous peoples in particular, in light of their histories and cultures, and has called upon States to take specific measures to protect their rights, including measures to “[e]nsure that indigenous communities can exercise their rights to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs.”

We do not see the land exchange parcels as providing sufficient “mitigation” value, because the current proposal simply replaces a plan to permanently fragment over 20 miles of landscape with a set of scattered exchange lands. The lands acquired by Resolution Copper (Oak Flat and the tailings disposal site) will essentially lose all ecological value as a result of the mining operation. Additionally, there would be significant new wildlife connectivity impacts because of the extensive distance between mining and waste disposal sites. These impacts, stretched out at a distance of over 20 miles, would result in substantial loss of ecological values. The proposed reclamation of the Oak Flat property after its 51-56 year life would never restore the property to its “pre-mine” condition. We recommend that Resolution Copper acquire sufficient acreage within the lower San Pedro River watershed in order to achieve “no net loss” of habitat value from the proposed project. One possible location with extensive habitat value lies contiguous and upstream from the Lower San Pedro River exchange parcel and is currently owned by BHP (the “Broken Hills Property”). This would enhance the protection of critical conservation lands where existing habitat is largely intact, along approximately 7.5 miles of the San Pedro River, and would contribute to the viability of several species (Yellow-billed cuckoo, Southwestern willow flycatcher, Lesser long-nosed bat, Desert Tortoise, Gila monster, Lowland leopard frogs, Mexican garter snake, etc.), providing a much more effective way to mitigate landscape fragmentation and the permanent loss of ecological value caused by the mining operation and mine waste disposal.

"CU01","Cumulative: Resource Impacts","CU","Cumulative","Resolution Copper Mine will obviously require a vast amount of water in a region of the country that is already experiencing water shortages. Arizona water law grants exceptional leeway to mines, which are essentially unregulated water users. As such, RCM may be entitled to develop a virtually unlimited number of wells and pump an unlimited amount of water from the Desert Wellfield. 
The Forest Service has incorrectly concluded that because of this water right, it is relieved of considering impacts that would arise from the exercising of this right. This approach is not sufficient under NEPA and does not satisfy the requirement under NEPA to take a “hard look” at environmental impacts:
 “In a cumulative impact analysis, an agency must take a “hard look” at all actions. An EA's analysis of cumulative impacts “must give a sufficiently detailed catalogue of past, present, and future projects, and provide adequate analysis about how these projects, and differences between the projects, are thought to have impacted the environment.” Lands Council, 395 F.3d at 1028. “General statements about ‘possible effects’ and ‘some risk’ do not constitute a ‘hard look’ absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.’ Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain, 137 F.3d at 1380.

Cumulative impacts are defined as “the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions.”83 One of the greatest contributions the Forest Service could have made to this process— but did not—would have been to conduct a thorough analysis on cumulative impacts of Resolution’s plan to pump 180 billion gallons of water from the aquifer in the East Salt River Valley.

"3.7.01","Water Resources: Groundwater Pumping","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," In order to construct the deep mine infrastructure, RCM has been dewatering the deep aquifer by pumping groundwater from the East Plant Site since 2009. Over the last five years, the average pumping rate has been approximately 620 gallons per minute,84 which corresponds to 326 million gallons per year, or 1,000 acre-feet per year. During peak operation of the mine, pumping would increase to 3,992 acre-feet per year (DEIS, Appendix H), or between 160,000 acre-feet over 51 years to provide access to the expanded deep mine workings.85 Resolution’s total, actual water demand is unclear (see below), but the DEIS estimates a total of 621,000 acre-feet of water over the life of the mine. Changes in the aquifer due to mine dewatering (and due to eventual block caving and land subsidence) could affect seeps, springs, flowing streams and riparian areas.86 The analysis of impacts on water supply and groundwater dependent ecosystems (“GDEs”) in the DEIS is flawed because it discounts most of the impacts of mine dewatering. Since 2009, Resolution has engaged in a large dewatering project to facilitate construction of Shaft 10 and allow future development of the deep workings for this mine. This has led to a decline in water levels in the deep bedrock aquifer of more than 2,000 feet, as documented in nearby monitoring wells.87 Due in part to the fact that the pumping is being conducted legally (i.e., Resolution has a permit for this pumping), the Forest Service has classified this past and current dewatering as a baseline condition that is not considered in the DEIS toward potential environmental impacts.88 This decision defies common sense and is improper under NEPA. The only purpose of the dewatering in question is to facilitate future mining. However, an even more egregious decision than not counting the pumping that has already taken place is the decision not to count the “baseline” pumping rate even after the mine becomes operational. During the life of the mine, all groundwater pumping that is necessary to conduct deep mining must be considered part of the project.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The decision to classify mine dewatering as a “baseline” condition is buried in the groundwater modeling technical reports. It is summarized briefly here. In support of the DEIS, two versions of the groundwater model were run. The first run was the “No Action” alternative which is a misnomer, because this scenario inexplicably incorporates components of the mining operation. In particular, the “No Action” alternative assumes that the mine would not be developed or operated but that mine dewatering would continue anyway for 51 years – the presumed life of the non-existent mine. 
The second modeling run seeks to simulate the proposed action, which incorporates some additional dewatering to maintain the expanded project infrastructure of full-scale mining as well as the hydrogeological effects of the collapse crater.89 Impacts are defined as the difference in groundwater drawdown between these two modeling scenarios.90 However, impacts from development of the mine only count as impacts if they are greater than the baseline impacts. In other words, impacts to water supply and groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) due to the substantial current dewatering program are not considered. In addition, for every year over the entire life of the mine, the current level of dewatering is subtracted from predicted future pumping, grossly under-reporting the amount of dewatering that will actually occur. This means that under the proposed action, much of the groundwater pumping at the mine location (even during mine operation) is not considered to be part of the project. 
There may be a logical rationale for excluding the pre-mine dewatering (we do not agree with this rationale, but there may be one) but surely, during the life of the mine, the pumping of thousands of acre feet of water to allow mining operations (and for no other purpose) must be considered a component of the overall project. 
As shown on Figure 3, after 51 years of “No-Action,” up to 500 feet of drawdown is predicted under Superior and impacts of 10 feet or more of drawdown extend over an area encompassing approximately 50 square miles. This decision explains why hydrogeological impacts of the so-called “No-Action” alternative can be quite substantial. For example, under the “No-Action” alternative, the groundwater model predicts a lowering of the water table at Bored Spring (located on the west side of Apache Leap) by nearly 100 feet. The degree of impact will almost certainly dry out Bored Spring, but it does not count as a project impact because of the Forest Service’s improper definition of “baseline.” Such effects do not count because they occur under the “No-Action” alternative even though virtually 100% of the cause of this drop in the water table is mine dewatering. Simply put, this is bad science because the “No-Action” analysis wrongly characterizes the facts of the current and prior dewatering.
 The consequence of this decision is to under-report the impacts of the preferred alternative and over-report impacts from the “No Action” alternative because it improperly assigns mining impacts (dewatering) to “No Action.”

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Ever since the General Plan of Operations (GPO) was submitted in 2016, there have been contradictions about how much water the Resolution Mine says it will require in order to operate. The DEIS does nothing to resolve this confusion and—in fact—is contradictory on this topic. In Table 2.2-1 (“Tailings Storage Facility Comparison”) the DEIS states that the preferred alternative (Skunk Camp Tailings option) will require 550,000 acre-feet of water from outside sources (“pumped from Desert Wellfield”). Similarly, Table 2.2-1 states that this is less water than would be needed for the proposed action (the Near West tailings option is listed as requiring 600,000 acre-feet over the life of the mine). The reader is then directed to Appendix H for further details of mine water Balance and use. Contrary to Table 2-2.1, Appendix H tabulates that Skunk Camp (Alternative 6) requires more water each year than Near West (Alternative 2): 25,881 acre-feet per year during peak operations for Skunk Camp vs. 22,250 acre-feet per year for Near West (p. H-3). In conclusion, the DEIS cannot possibly evaluate the impacts of the mine’s water usage if it cannot figure out just how much water Resolution plans to use. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","40 CFR §1502.24 requires that agencies ensure scientific integrity of analyses in environmental impact statements. This means that scientific analyses must be reliable. As noted in the DEIS, 
The Groundwater Modeling Workgroup recognized that a fundamental limitation of the model—of any model—is the unreliability of predictions far in the future, and the workgroup was tasked with determining a time frame that would be reasonable to assess.91 (Emphasis supplied). 
The Workgroup subsequently “determined that results could be reasonably assessed up to 200 years into the future.” (DEIS, p. 300). This is a problem because some hydrogeological impacts not only persist, but actually get worse in timeframes beyond 200 years. 
The groundwater model was actually run for 1,000 years into the future (DEIS, p. 296) although only the first 200 years are reported quantitatively in the DEIS. This long-term analysis documented that in some areas around the mine, groundwater levels will continue to decline for many hundreds of years, thus potential impacts to GDEs will only increase beyond the 200-year cut-off for analysis. For example, the 1,000-year hydrograph produced by Resolution’s modeling consultant for Hidden Spring predicts a continuing decline in groundwater levels for almost 800 years.92 That impacts continue (and worsen) over such vast timeframes is a testament to how large and disruptive this project truly is and how environmental impacts from this project should be measured on a geologic time scale. 
By limiting the period of analysis to 200 years, the Forest Service is discounting the worst impacts that are predicted to occur in later centuries. The Forest Service also acknowledges (see quotation above) that the best scientific tool available (three-dimensional groundwater modeling) is not up to the task of analyzing such impacts. The Forest Service did not meet its obligation under 40 CFR §1502.24 because it did not maintain scientific integrity in analyzing hydrogeological impacts beyond 200 years, even though such impacts are certain and significant. 
The limitations and unreliability of the groundwater model are simply the most recent chapter in a long saga of Resolution falsely claiming that it understands the hydrogeology of the project area well enough to assess impacts due to mining. Indeed, Resolution has conducted substantial investigations into the hydrogeology of the project area; however, the Forest Service has failed to recognize that the knowledge base was still inadequate for the purposes of the DEIS. 
The hydrogeology of the project area is extremely complex, with multiple aquifers, multiple faults and variable rock types. When combined with a proposed project of such immense scale, it is a significant challenge to conduct a groundwater impact analysis and the Forest Service has not met this challenge. Starting at least as early as 2016, Resolution’s consultants assured the Forest Service scientists and others that the West Boundary Fault, Concentrator Fault and other faults would limit the western aerial extent of groundwater drawdown (under Superior and farther west) from mine dewatering at Shafts 9 and 10. Resolution’s own computer model contradicted this conclusion, instead showing nearly 10 feet of drawdown as far west as the Boyce Thompson Arboretum (see Figure 5 showing substantial drawdown beyond the boundary faults surrounding the mine site). In addition, Resolution’s hydrogeological studies failed to predict the inflow of 600 gallons per minute of hydrothermal groundwater (170° F) that was encountered when sinking Shaft 10.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," One of the most important expectations of the groundwater modeling effort was to assist the Forest Service in evaluating future impacts to springs and perennial streams that support groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs).94 The computer model used to evaluate this issue does not quantitatively simulate groundwater-surface water interactions: “Changes in stream flow cannot be evaluated based on the groundwater model.”95 Instead, it was decided that a finding of hydrogeological “impact” would only be identified if the model predicted at least a 10-foot drop in the groundwater elevation in the immediate vicinity of a GDE. As stated in the DEIS,
 “… the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup determined that to properly reflect the level of uncertainty inherent in the modeling effort, results less than 10 feet should not be disclosed or relied upon, as these results are beyond the ability of the model to predict.”96 

In short, the Forest Service has acknowledged that its scientific methodology (groundwater modeling) has a limit of precision of plus or minus 10 feet. The Working Group concluded that drawdowns of less than 10 feet could still have an impact on GDEs: 

The Groundwater Modeling Workgroup recognized that while the model may not be reliable for results less than 10 feet in magnitude, changes in aquifer water level much less than 10 feet still could have meaningful effects on GDEs, even leading to complete drying.97”

Due to the limitation of the model, in places where the model predicts drawdown greater than zero but less than 10 feet, the Forest Service assumed (without proof) that there are no impacts, “to properly reflect the level of uncertainty inherent in the modeling effort, results less than 10 feet should not be disclosed or relied upon.”98 The Forest Service did not scientifically conclude that 10 feet or more of groundwater drawdown is needed to cause an impact on GDEs, this was just an arbitrary number based on limitations of the method of analysis, not some scientific principle. 
In conclusion, the Forest Service chose a methodology that is incapable of analyzing impacts of mine dewatering and the collapse crater on GDEs. As noted in BGC’s review of the groundwater model, there are two principal ways to simulate groundwater-surface water interaction in the selected modeling software (MODFLOW-SURFACT): using the drains (DRN) software package or the streamflow routing (SFR) packages.99 Resolution used the DRN approach but BGC points out that the SFR approach would have been better: “The SFR package allows for the most comprehensive modeling of groundwater-surface water interaction.” 100 
In this instance, the Forest Service is not meeting its obligation under 40 CFR §1502.24, because it is relying on a scientific method (groundwater modeling) that is not capable of predicting significant hydrogeological impacts for this complex project.

"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Inadequate Consideration of Alternatives to Block Cave Mining as a Way to Avoid Permanent Water Resource Impacts 
Once the 1.8-mile wide collapse crater forms, as a result of RCM’s operations, the Apache Leap Tuff Aquifer will be altered forever. As stated in the DEIS, “The deep groundwater system is being and would continue to be actively dewatered, and once block-caving begins the Apache Leap Tuff would begin to dewater as well.”101 The Apache Leap Tuff Aquifer is a critical source of water for springs and creeks, many of them sacred. This permanent impact would not occur if alternative underground mining methods were employed, but the Forest Service did not conduct an adequate analysis of alternative mining methods (as discussed elsewhere in these comments) largely because the Forest Service accepted Resolution’s assertion that any method other than block cave mining would be too expensive. The DEIS disclosed a number of profound impacts due to the collapse crater that cannot be mitigated, including to water resources. By failing to conduct an acceptable and competent evaluation of project alternatives that could avoid the impacts caused by the collapse zone, the Forest Service is allowing one factor (cost of mining; i.e., Resolution’s profitability) to outweigh all environmental and social factors combined.

"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS concludes that the Resolution Copper Mine project will or is likely to deplete water supplies and harm or destroy the streams, springs, seeps and other water features in Oak Flat, Ga’an Canyon (Devil’s Canyon), Mineral Creek and Queen Creek: “Between 14 and 16 GDEs, mostly sacred springs, would be anticipated to be impacted by dewatering. Although mitigation would replace water, impacts would remain to the natural setting of these places.”102
 First, the estimate of 14 to 16 GDEs is almost certainly an underestimate because springs impacted by “baseline” mine dewatering (see comment 1, above) are simply not counted. Second, the proposed mitigation for GDEs is inadequate. Mitigation plans are outlined in an April 2019 report by Montgomery & Associates entitled, “Monitoring and Mitigation Plan for Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems and Water Wells.” This report calls for replacing water flows in springs and creeks by pumping water from nearby wells (i.e., tapping groundwater from deeper in the aquifer), storing water in tanks and piping the water to the creek or stream or by constructing various water-collecting devices such as so-called “guzzlers,” surface water capture systems or even trucking water in from alternative sources. Replacing a natural system with a manufactured facsimile of the system is not the intention of mitigation under NEPA. Just as it would not be permissible to replace the real Half Dome with a very large photograph of Half Dome, it is not permissible to replace lost GDEs with artful but artificial copies of natural systems. It was not the intention of NEPA to replace nature with Disney-like imitations of nature. 
"
"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," Second, the monitoring plan for GDEs is also inadequate because its discussion of triggers (i.e., occurrences or observations that would trigger mitigation activities) is vague and incomplete. The Montgomery Report (Monitoring and Mitigation Plan for Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems and Water Wells) reveals that Resolution has built in (and the Forest Service has bought into) any number of ways to avoid actually implementing mitigation measures for GDEs. In particular, the Plan explains that Resolution will somehow differentiate the impacts from its dewatering from other variables such as “changes in weather and/or climate, impacts to the regional and/or local groundwater system from other human causes, landscape changes such as landslides and fires, natural succession of the GDE into a new presentation such as an increase in phreatophytic plants coincident with a reduction in spring flow rates, or other reasons not included in this document.” Other than noting that Resolution will employ “multiple lines of evidence” there is no quantitative or qualitative discussion of how Resolution will accomplish this difficult task. Considering that all of the GDEs covered by the monitoring plan have already been identified as likely to be severely impacted by mine dewatering, this is a problematic situation and is inadequate under NEPA. "
"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","mitigation triggers are described qualitatively as a decline in groundwater elevations or a decline in stream flow but there are no quantitative triggers. This is inadequate. The DEIS should clearly delineate quantitative triggers for each GDE (i.e., groundwater decline of greater than X feet over Y monitoring events) and the DEIS must clearly explain how Resolution intends to “confirm that observed changes are caused by mine activities” and the DEIS must confirm that these methods are scientifically reliable. "
"3.7.10","Water Resources: Mitigation","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Appendix J of the DEIS specifies that the monitoring and mitigation plan is not intended to address water sources associated with perched shallow groundwater in alluvium or fractures. Including shallow fracture flow in this statement incorrectly excludes important and probably inevitable impacts directly related to mining. Fracture flow103 is likely the dominant groundwater flow mechanism in the Apache Leap Tuff and this groundwater unit is the source of water discharges that support riparian zones in Ga’an Canyon (Devil’s Canyon), Mineral Creek and possibly Queen Creek. The groundwater system in the Apache Leap Tuff will be profoundly and irrevocably altered by the formation of the collapse crater. The DEIS is incorrect in excluding shallow fracture flow from monitoring and mitigation requirements. [Footnotes: 103 Groundwater flow is generally thought of as flow through porous media, that is, through the pore spaces between the grains that make up sediments and sedimentary rocks. This is considered “primary porosity.” Fractures are a form of secondary porosity, created due to tectonic forces or other stresses on the rock. Large fractures can increase rates of groundwater flow very substantially compared to the generally slow flow through porous media, thus can be very important in mountainous regions with significant fracturing.]"
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS makes the incredible assumption that the mineralized, fractured rock in the collapse zone will not be in contact with oxygen, thus will not form acid rock drainage. This is a highly optimistic conclusion that defies common sense. As the collapse zone forms, the rock will become fractured (thus increasing its hydraulic conductivity many orders of magnitude) and largely dewatered. For the purposes of groundwater modeling, Resolution assumes that the hydraulic conductivity104 of rock in the cave zone will increase by as much as a factor of a million: “Maximum hydraulic conductivity values were altered by a multiplier of 1E+6 or to a hydraulic conductivity of 100 ft/day, whichever occurs first…The maximum hydraulic conductivity value of 100 ft/day was selected because it is much higher than the natural, unaltered bedrock, but higher values caused the model to become unstable.” (WSP, February 2019, Resolution Copper Groundwater Flow Report, pp. 37-38). This statement highlights another deficiency of the groundwater model: hydraulic conductivity of rock in the collapse zone was arbitrarily limited to 100 ft/day because the model would crash if higher (i.e., more realistic) values were used. 
Atmospheric air will easily penetrate the fracture zone, supplying oxygen into a subsurface environment that has probably been devoid of oxygen for thousands if not millions of years. This assumption (no oxygen thus no acid-generating reactions in to collapse zone) is likely incorrect and likely greatly understates the impacts from acid rock drainage within the mine and in ore stockpiles. 
[Footnotes: 104 Hydraulic conductivity is a measure of the ease by which groundwater flows through an aquifer. This, in turn, affects the groundwater velocity through the aquifer. Solid rock has a very low hydraulic conductivity; sandstone has a higher hydraulic conductivity and very coarse grained sediments like gravels have even higher hydraulic conductivity.]

"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources"," The principal accomplishment of the DEIS seems to be to propose a new location for the mine’s 1.37 billion tons of tailings, but the DEIS is inadequate in its assessment of impacts at this new location to surface water and groundwater quality due to seepage from the preferred tailings storage facility. Water quality impacts from the tailings is one of the most profound and concerning environmental issues for a mine of this size, yet there is virtually no defensible scientific analysis of this issue in the DEIS. For this reason alone, the DEIS should be withdrawn. Indeed, except the Near West site, there is no true, data-supported, site-specific analysis of potential impacts to surface water and groundwater quality at any of the alternative tailings sites. "

Instead, the DEIS analysis for Skunk Camp contains mere speculation and substitutes data from Near West to complete the essential hydrogeological evaluation. In the context of understanding hydrogeological impacts at Skunk Camp and comparing the alternatives tailings sites, the DEIS must provide real data for each site. At best, the current analysis provides a qualitative ranking that Skunk Camp is better than other sites because water quality impacts at Skunk Camp could be more easily controlled. This qualitative assessment is an inadequate substitute for the NEPA requirement to accurately analyze potential environmental impacts to groundwater and surface water quality. "

"IA01","Issues Analysis: Proposed New Issue","IA","Issues Analysis","The Effects Of Subsidence On Weather Modification 
The DEIS fails to discuss the weather patterns which will be affected during and after the mining process by a vertical collapse of the mountain formation overlying and surrounding the ore body. The draft fails to consider wind rose patterns which will be affected by the vertical collapse of the mountain unit, and the resulting alteration of the related precipitation. (3.2.2.1). The San Carlos Apache Reservation is located approximately 20 miles east of the Oak Flat site which is the site of the ore body and the central location of the collapse which will occur. That mountain formation is a weather maker for the region and a sky island within the desert. It provides a substantial influence on wind patterns and the patterns of rainfall and snowfall within the region. 
Subsidence will have an effect on precipitation on the Reservation. The San Carlos Apache mineral strip and the San Carlos Apache Cutter Basin are two locations which will be affected by any change in precipitation which will result from the collapse and subsidence of any portion of the mountain range. The San Carlos Apache mineral strip is located on the west side of the Gila River below Coolidge Dam. The Cutter Basin is located between the San Carlos River and the western San Carlos Apache Reservation boundary near Globe, AZ, approximately 20 miles east of the mine site. The water supply and recharge for the Cutter Basin is primarily from two sources: the first and greatest source is precipitation on the Pinal Mountains through the snowmelt and rainfall entering the mountain front recharge zone and moving to the northeast into the Cutter Basin. The other source of the recharge is the surface precipitation falling on the headwaters of Ranch Creek and Goodwin Wash on the San Carlos Reservation and the infiltration of that surface flow into the Cutter Basin. The water in the Cutter Basin west of the San Carlos boundary is the water supply for the City of Globe, which has municipal wells lined up running north and south along the western boundary of the San Carlos Reservation overlying the Cutter Basin. The groundwater in the Cutter Basin is also a primary source of water presently, and in the future, for the San Carlos Apache Tribe. It is high quality compared to other sources of water for both the City of Globe and the San Carlos Apache Tribe. The rights to the groundwater in the Cutter Basin and the surface water overlying the Cutter Basin within the San Carlos Apache Reservation were adjudicated in 1999 in case number W 1-4, In re the General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Gila River System and Source. 
Pursuant to an agreement related to that adjudication, the City of Globe may pump up to 2,500 acre-feet of water per year from the City of Globe municipal wells located on the west side of the western boundary of the San Carlos Reservation. The Tribe has the exclusive right to use both surface water and groundwater within the Reservation under the San Carlos Apache Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 102-575, 106 Stat. 4740 (October 30, 1992) and the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Agreement dated March 30, 1999. A decrease in precipitation on that portion of the watershed which supplies the recharge of both surface and groundwater for the Cutter Basin would dramatically threaten the San Carlos Apache Tribe’s vested rights to surface water and groundwater, which water rights are held in trust by the United States.107
 Negative impacts to weather patterns may extend east through the Reservation into the upper Gila drainage in New Mexico. The draft fails to discuss in any matter whatsoever the potential impact on the environment, including the precipitation and wind patterns which will result from the collapse of a portion of the mountain range and its impact in all directions surrounding the collapsed mountain formation. The DEIS also fails to discuss the precipitation patterns for direct runoff to the Gila River as a result of that collapse, the precipitation available in the terms of surface water and rainfall on the mineral strip, and the effect on the adjudicated water rights under the Globe Equity Decree. 
The Globe Equity Decree adjudicates rights to the mainstream of the Gila River from ten miles east of the New Mexico boundary with the State of Arizona to near the junction of the Gila and Salt Rivers on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona. The DEIS contains no analysis of the potential changes to precipitation as it contributes to the flows of the Gila River and the storage of the waters of the Gila River, including in the San Carlos Reservoir within the San Carlos Reservation, and the flows and water available to the holders of water rights under the Globe Equity Decree.

 It should be noted that if the subsidence angle turns out to be less than the 70 to 78 degrees predicted, especially after mining ceases, the fracture zone shown in Figure 16 (DEIS 2019) would move closer to Apache Leap. Any mining of a deeper resource, if done by block caving, the only method considered by Resolution Copper, the fracture zone would likely also widen. As a result, a significant part of the deeper resource would need to be sterilized to protect Apache Leap. With underground backfill this significant part of the resource could be mined. Underground mining with backfill was inappropriately eliminated from consideration as an alternative because the impacts that could be avoided were not given proper consideration.

All of the water pumped from the well which takes any portion of its water from subflow is subject to the general subject matter jurisdiction of the State water adjudication court.109 The test for whether the cone of depression of a well would intercept the subflow of a river is whether that well, assuming pre-development conditions and steady state pumping, would cause a reduction in subflow of 1/10 of one foot. If so, the entire production of that well is included within the subject matter jurisdiction of the adjudication court adjudicating prior appropriation water rights. (See 2005 Decision).
The use of a well which acquires any of its water from a surface water right subject to prior appropriation can only be acquired after 1919 by strict compliance with the statutory process set out in the Arizona Revised Statutes.110 
There is no indication of the specific location of the proposed production wells by Resolution Copper and no analysis of whether the production of such wells would cause a drawdown of 1/10th of one foot under pre-development conditions pumped at steady state. In fact, the DEIS’s analysis of the production of pumping of wells acknowledges that the data points available for analysis for a numerical model are inadequate to provide reasonably accurate scientific results accurate to a point of less than 10 vertical feet of reduction. 
The fact that RCM failed to provide statistical data and data points necessary to provide a modeling result which would be capable of producing a reliable scientific prediction of a level less than a drawdown of 10 feet is indefensible and a material failure of this DEIS to properly evaluate the environmental impact of the operation of multiple wells proposed to be operated by Resolution Copper to support its mining operations, its ore processing facility, and its transportation by pipeline of processed ores and processed waste. It is also a material failure of the DEIS to properly evaluate the environmental impact of the drawdown of groundwater levels and its potential impact on water supplies and flowing streams, partially dependent upon the baseflow contribution of groundwater, which could be reduced by the operation of the production wells.

It summarily deals with these radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials, heavy metals and asbestos in primarily a spreadsheet form, acknowledging the existence of a few samples in which radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials, heavy metals and asbestos were identified and reciting a degree of risk that was related to that sample concentration.

The DEIS does not describe the process by which the degree of risk was evaluated or the definition of the various categories of risk, which are employed in its spreadsheet analysis. It fails to deal with the concentration of the radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials, heavy metals and asbestos in the mining process and the location of the radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials, heavy metals and asbestos into the water system and the chemical reaction of the radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials, heavy metals and asbestos with the ore, waste rock, and solution in the transport pipeline of these various components and the processed ores, the various locations and the deposition and creation of waste dump sites containing the residue of those processes. It also fails to deal with the fact that radioactive materials described in the spreadsheet are currently located in consolidated hard rock, where the transmission of radioactive materials to other locations is slow to non-existent, to a situation where the hard rock will be pulverized, which will make the radioactive material readily available for chemical reaction and transportation by the water pipeline systems for processing and transporting the ore to dump sites. It also fails to recognize that once the material has been placed in the dump sites, the radioactive, toxic and hazardous materials, heavy metals and asbestos can become airborne from the surface of the dump sites and waste sites and be transported up by local air movement into populated zones.

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," Impacts of Arizona Department of Environmental Quality Efforts to Assume Primacy on  404 Permits
  The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) is considering seeking primacy for  this important Section 404 Clean Water Act program and because of the potential and significant  changes, we think it is something the Forest Service should have considered. There are many  issues related to that assumption that have potential to have a significant and negative impacts on  waters of the United States that are affected by this proposed mine. In addition to the fact that the state will have no public interest review and no NEPA analysis, there are serious concerns about  expertise in administering the program, protection of cultural resources, and proper consultation  related to endangered species, among others. 
 Of grave concern is the possible outcome that because ADEQ intends to fund the program  through permitting fees, the agency will become motivated to quickly issue permits that would  otherwise require careful consideration. If the state elects to assume primacy and the costs that  come with it, a dedicated funding source must be developed so that the state is not incentivized  to issue permits for the wrong reasons and so there is funding for program staff during times  when fewer permits are requested, such as economic downturns. 
 Another concern that has been widely voiced across stakeholder groups is that because this  program has been administered by the Army Corps of Engineers, ADEQ does not possess the  expertise or experience to run the program. This concern is not independent of funding concerns,  since without general fund commitments or significant federal funds, it is difficult to imagine  how the agency will be able to bring in additional experts. A fee-funded program will take time  to generate funds, but the costs associated with program assumption will be immediate. 
 There will also be a lack of clarity on which waters will be subject to state assumption.  Regulation of “navigable waters” of the U.S. will, of necessity, remain under the purview of the  Army Corps, since by law it cannot be delegated to the states. To our knowledge, the Corps has  not sorted out or mapped much of what could be termed navigable waters of the U.S. within  Arizona. Such a process is essential in order to facilitate an orderly assumption of primacy, but it  is not within ADEQ’s capacity to conduct it. This is a fact- and science-intensive process that is  expensive, complex, and time-consuming. The state of Florida was recently delayed in its rush to  assume 404 primacy when their unrealistic timeline did not allow sufficient time for the Army  Corps to make these determinations. 
 If ADEQ assumes responsibility for the 404 permit program, there will be no implementation of  the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for major projects that now require 404 permits,  and the state has no comparable environmental impact assessment law. Without NEPA, the  public is robbed of an opportunity to review and analyze comprehensive information about the  environmental and related economic and social impacts of a proposed action and to advocate for  their communities and for the environment.  
We are additionally concerned that endangered species and cultural resources will not receive the  protections that they do under a federal program. A state assuming primacy must work to  implement alternative means of coordination with “other federal resource programs.” If permits  will be administered under state law, rather than federal law, the state must develop “alternative mechanisms” to “ensure compliance with the requirements of the federal Endangered Species  Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and similar federal programs.” (Clean Water Act,  Section 404) Even if a state-led program develops guidelines or procedures that are modelled  after the protections of NEPA, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered  Species Act (ESA), policies and even rules may not offer the equivalent legal protections of a  federal law. Federal agencies also have mandates to coordinate with one another, so to retain the  benefits of collaboration, a state assuming primacy must work to implement alternative means of  coordination with other federal resource programs. 
 There are nuances on issues around 404 regulations that have been established and/or settled in  the federal courts. Changing this regulatory framework at the state level invites the possibility  that some of these legal issues could be reopened in a new wave of litigation.

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","Draft Practicability Analysis - Section 404 Permit  
Considering the scope of the tailings site facilities -- the amount, 1.37 billion tons, and the  impact, the alternatives, analysis, and mitigation under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act are  woefully inadequate. Factors considered by the USFS included “locations within a reasonable  proximity to the Resolution mine site, favorable topography, sufficient storage capacity, and a  configuration suitable for conventional tailings impoundment construction as described in the  GPO.” (Draft Practicability Analysis pg 4). These factors are not appropriate for consideration of  a 404 permit. For the 404 permit, the focus must be on whether practicable alternatives exist that are less damaging to the environment and on limiting degradation to waters. Further, a public  interest review must be done. This clearly was not done here.  Had the focus been on a less damaging alternative, clearly something that limited the amount of  tailings, such as alternative mining methods or multiple brownfield sites for tailings would have  been preferred. Why did the site have to accommodate the “total volume of tailings?” Why  wasn’t an alternative considered that included fewer tailings, limiting how much can actually be  removed from the mine, or an alternative mining method that would result in few tailings? Why  weren’t additional brownfield locations considered? Perhaps two of the brownfield sites that  already have infrastructure in place. Why pollute even more of our waters with use of a  greenfield site? If there are two sites in places where there has already been substantial impact  from mining, how does that create more of a footprint or more of a risk than destroying a whole  new area?  
The Near West Dry TSF Alternative would result in “dissolved copper loading of Queen Creek,  an impaired water.” (Draft Practicability Analysis pg 19). How could this alternative be  practicable, considering this significant impact?  
Likewise, the Skunk Camp Alternative is not practicable. It will cause undue harm to the  Dripping Spring Wash basin, resulting in impacts to the Gila River. The language in the Draft  Practicability Analysis regarding the Skunk Camp Alternative is disturbing as it indicates that  “only ephemeral drainages” are included in the footprint (Draft Practicability Analysis pg 13) --  as if these ephemeral drainages are insignificant and unimportant. While there are attempts to  ignore their significance, it is undeniable that ephemeral waters are critical in an arid  environment such as this and should be protected by the Clean Water Act, especially due to the  connections to the Gila. Destroying whole new sections of ephemeral drainages is not the least  harmful option. Note that this alternative assumes that an aquifer protection permit can be issued  with the point of compliance miles from the tailings facility. This seems to be a bit of a stretch.

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","     The Corps must fully consider the impacts from the entire mine in making its public interest  determination. “To require [the Corps] to ignore the indirect effects that would result from its  actions would be to require it to wear blinders that Congress has not chosen to impose.”  Riverside , 758 F.2d at 512. In addition to the above-analyzed cases, the Ninth Circuit has  recognized the Corps’ duty to consider these impacts in order to ensure that issuance of the 404  permit is in “the public interest.” In Ocean Advocates , after finding that the Corps failed to  consider the cumulative impacts from increased shipping traffic resulting from the issuance of a  404 permit for an oil refinery dock, the court noted that upon remand and consideration of these  effects, “the Corps may impose conditions on the operation of permitted terminals at any time  ‘to satisfy legal requirements or to otherwise satisfy the public interest.’ 33 C.F.R. §325.4(a).”  402 F.3d at 871 (emphasis added) [See letter submittal pgs 307 - 314 for additional detail]"
"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process"," As discussed herein, the proposed discharge does not comply with the 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Pursuant to the Guidelines, no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if, among other things, a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem. 40 C.F.R. § 230.10. The Corps also cannot authorize any discharge of dredged or fill material that will cause or contribute to significant degradation of the waters of the United States. § 230.10(c). The “degradation or destruction of special aquatic sites, such as filling operations in wetlands, is considered to be among the most severe environmental impacts covered by the[] Guidelines.” § 230.10(d). 
Under the 404(b)(1) guidelines, the Corps is required to consider the following effects, individually and collectively, that contribute to significant degradation: 
(1) Significantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on human health or welfare, including but not limited to effects on municipal water supplies, plankton, fish, shellfish, wildlife, and special aquatic sites. 
(2) Significantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on life stages of aquatic life and other wildlife dependent on aquatic ecosystems, including the transfer, concentration, and spread of pollutants or their byproducts outside of the disposal site through biological, physical, and chemical processes; 
(3) Significantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on aquatic ecosystem diversity, productivity, and stability. Such effects may include, but are not limited to, loss of fish and wildlife habitat or loss of the capacity of a wetland to assimilate nutrients, purify water, or reduce wave energy; or 
(4) Significantly adverse effects of discharge of pollutants on recreational, aesthetic, and economic values. 
§ 230.10(c). As shown herein, the proposed mine will violate these requirements and thus a 404 permit cannot be issued. 
The Corps is required to base this determination on factual determinations, evaluations, and tests required under the guidelines, and to focus in particular on the persistence and permanence of the effects. Id . The Guidelines require the Corps to make certain factual determinations addressing the potential short-term or long-term effects of a proposed discharge of dredged or fill material on the physical, chemical, and biological components of the aquatic environment.864 This includes determinations on (a) physical substrate; (b) water circulation, fluctuation, and salinity determinations; (c) suspended particulate/turbidity determinations; (d) contaminant determinations; (e) aquatic ecosystem and organism determinations; (f) proposed disposal site determinations; (g) determinations of cumulative effects on the aquatic ecosystem; and (h) determinations of secondary effects on the aquatic ecosystem. § 230.11(a)–(h). 
When a project is not “water dependent,” as in the case of the mine, and the project would fill “special aquatic sites,” including wetlands, the Corps’ regulations create a rebuttable presumption that there are practicable and environmentally preferable alternatives, and such alternatives are presumed to have less adverse impact unless “clearly demonstrated” otherwise. 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a)(3); Sierra Club v. Flowers , 423 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1352 (S.D. Fla. 2006). This substantive requirement mandates the Corps to select the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative (LEDPA). 
An alternative is practicable “if it is available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes.” 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a)(2). Practicable alternatives include “activities which do not involve a discharge of dredged or fill material,” as well as “discharges of dredged or fill material at other locations” where such discharges would result in fewer impacts to the aquatic environment. § 230.10(a)(1). The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that no feasible alternative exists, and the Corps must engage in a reasoned analysis of this issue. Flowers , 423 F. Supp. 2d at 1356–57. 
The Corps cannot blindly and uncritically accept an applicant’s study of alternatives and its assertions that no practicable alternative exists. Friends of the Earth v. Hintz , 800 F.2d 822, 835–36 (9th Cir. 1986). Under the regulations, any “practicable” alternative to achieve the basic and overall project purposes must be determined to be cost-effective, when viewed from the perspective of the industry as a whole. The financial circumstances of a particular applicant are not considered relevant if an alternative could be achieved practicably by a “typical” applicant. The preamble to the 404(b)(1) regulations states: “Our intent is to consider those alternatives which are reasonable in terms of the overall scope/cost of the proposed project. The term economic might be construed to include consideration of the applicant’s financial standing, or investment, or market share, a cumbersome inquiry which is not necessarily material to the objectives of the Guidelines. We consider it implicit that, to be practicable, an alternative must be capable of achieving the basic purpose of the proposed activity.” 45 Fed. Reg. 85,339 (Dec. 24, 1980). 
But the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative need not be the least-costly, nor the most profitable. Louisiana Wildlife Federation, Inc. v. York , 761 F.2d 1044, 1048 (5th Cir. 1985) (noting that the Corps had properly chosen “alternatives that reduced both the applicants’ profit and the economic efficiency of their proposed operations in order to preserve other environmental values”). The regulations presume that less environmentally damaging alternatives are available to the applicant and practicable, unless the applicant clearly demonstrates otherwise. In the absence of such a clear showing, the Corps is required to deny the permit application. See 40 C.F.R. § 230.12(a)(3)(i), (iv). Thus, in this case, the preferred tailings location in Skunk Camp does not comply with these requirements. [See letter submittal pgs 304 – 314 for additional detail]

"NP07","NEPA: Army Corps Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","Analysis of water quality in the DEIS is inadequate. Additionally, evidence to date raises significant question whether the Resolution Copper Mine will be issued a Clean Water Act 404 permit by the Army Corps due to threats to the quality of surface and groundwaters, lack of consultation pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and insufficient Tribal consultation, among other concerns (see full discussion of § 404 certification at section IV above). The Army Corps is separately evaluating Resolution Copper’s application. Furthermore, an essential part of the 404 permit process is Clean Water Act Section 401 certification by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality that the activities authorized by the 404 permit will not violate state water quality standards. Since Resolution Copper has yet to obtain either permit, the DEIS is inadequate because it fails to consider these issues, including the foreseeable possibility that the Corps will deny a 404 permit or will condition it significantly on altered operations of the mine. The DEIS must be revised, or a supplemental DEIS must be prepared, for public comment to consider the impacts of the 404 permit and the 401 state certification, both of which may be denied. "

This information is necessary for the Tribe’s ability to provide meaningful DEIS comments regarding the Skunk Camp TSF. The APE for the Skunk Camp has been, and as far as the Tribe is aware, still is posted for no trespassing and is off limits for review and inspection. For Apaches, this is not and cannot be a “desktop” survey. We need time to visit, learn from the representatives of the clans with traditional ties to the Dripping Springs valley, and consider traditional knowledge in relation to the newly unveiled plans to destroy another cherished part of our homeland. The APE is part of the traditional territories of T’iis Tseban (Pinal Band) and Tse Binesti’e (Aravaipa Band) driven from the Dripping Springs and Pinal Mountain areas by military-industrial campaigns from 1859 to 1874. Time is needed for the Apache aboriginal landowners to re-familiarize themselves with the land and resources they were evicted from. We request the opportunity, for the first time in generations, to be welcomed back to the springs, camp areas, and plant and mineral gathering places to assess existing conditions. We need to assess and consider connections between what we see on the land today and what we have been told by our elders.

The Lower San Pedro River parcel is not an inholding of surrounding federal land, and it has been managed with certain specific restrictions regarding off-road vehicle use and associated dust pollution.

As best I can tell, only pp 418-19 in the “Environmental Consequences” chapter 3 touch on TENORM—and only on water pollution concerns (as in “(TENORM) could result in water quality concerns in seepage from the tailings storage facility.” Potential consequences of such matter getting airborne as not addressed either there, or on the 16 or so pages related to air quality / air pollution. This is a SERIOUS OMISSION, given that the radioactive elements identified as of concern on pp 418-19—uranium, thorium, and radium—are all alpha emitters. While such direct radiation from such emitters is easily shielded (human skin does a nice job), if alpha emitters become attached to dust particles they can readily be breathed in and wreck havoc via inhalation. The result can be deadly lung and other cancers. Language on pp 418-19—particularly the last sentence (highlighted by me) I cite below—is concerning: ""The potential for this problem to occur was assessed based on analysis conducted on 5,987 samples of Resolution copper ore from 137 exploration boreholes, master ore composites, laboratory-simulated tailings samples, and background groundwater quality samples. When compared with common background levels, review of existing information at the site does not suggest the strong presence of naturally occurring radioactive materials above typical concentrations, although a small percentage (2 to 6 percent) of samples have exhibited concentrations above thresholds of concern."" Given the huge crater size and huge amounted of excavated waste material to pile up (one waste tailing area cited in the DEIS spanned 2574 acres and 750 million tons of material!) taking a seemingly small 2 to 6 percent of a very very big amount still yields a very big amount. Plenty of alpha particle contaminated material that could be lifted into the air by the wind and end up in human lungs causing deadly cancers many years later! Of course covering waste tailings could greatly lessen if not eliminate such concerns. So, a question for project managers, “Though the waste tailings areas will be very very extensive, will you agree cover them out of concern for radioactive material induced lung cancers? If not, please explain why you will not take undertake this mitigation measure?”"

TNC purchased the farm in 2001 and significantly reduced the water use to increase the water available to the riparian vegetation along the San Pedro river which runs through the property for approximately one mile. There has been some significant riparian recovery along the river corridor but there has also been some encroachment by non-native species, namely Tamarisk. In 2013 a restoration project funded by the Arizona Water Protection Fund was completed on 100 acres of the historically irrigated portion. The project involved decommissioning of a large ditch and berm to restore the natural flows of 2 ephemeral washes across the floodplain terrace and the area was seeded with native vegetation. This strategy demonstrated success in reducing the amount of sediment this portion of the farm was contributing to the river and restoring the natural physical features on that portion of the farm. 125 acres of the historic farm is still in need of restoration. The landscape was altered by the development of terraced fields, laser leveled at different elevations to enable flood irrigation, and there remains a network of abandoned concrete lined irrigation ditches. These alterations prevent the natural sheet flows across the floodplain from the upland area to the river. Currently storm water isbeing channelized, accelerating surface erosion and creating large sink holes across the floodplain. The irrigation ditches need to be removed and the terraces re-contoured to establish a more natural transition from the uplands. Approximately 1000 yards of concrete lined ditches need to be removed and backfilled. After recontouring, the entire area would benefit from seeding with native vegetation, grasses and shrubs, to provide groundcover and hold the soil more effectively in the restored areas. Irrigation could be redeveloped for temporary use to accelerate the restoration of native vegetation. Another key component to the project is the removal of non-native species along the one mile of river corridor. The stands of Tamarisk are intermittent but continue to expand which effects the areas available for the establishment of native riparian species. H&E is located a short distance upstream from the San Pedro Wildlife Area, owned and managed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, where large scale efforts are planned to remove Tamarisk and establish an in-lieu mitigation credit program.

The mine is in Laurel Canyon, a large tributary to Aravaipa Creek, near Klondyke. The mine has been inactive since 1958 but large tailing piles remain and are a source of lead and other contaminates found in sediments downstream in Aravaipa Creek. Aravaipa Creek has long been recognized for its exceptional ecological value, 22 miles of perennial surface flow provide critical habitat for 9 species of native fish, most listed as threatened or endangered. Two species, the Spikedace and Loach Minnow, would be in peril of extinction if a catastrophic event were to occur within the Aravaipa watershed. Aravaipa’s population of those species are the source for repatriation efforts to re-establish the fish within their historic range in Arizona. Elevated lead levels have been found in tissue samples from fish in Aravaipa Creek and there are two likely sources, a large tailing dump next to Aravaipa Creek where a ball mill processed ore and the tailings piles associated with the Grand Reef Mine. The ball mill site tailings are now managed by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and efforts have been made to contain and cap the tailings pile. The tailings at the Grand Reef Mine still need to be addressed in a similar way. The tailings are in a wash so they can be transported downstream during flood events and are also a source of airborne contaminates that end up in the stream. Analysis of lead isotopes found in the sediments downstream by University of Arizona scientists have determined the tailings at Grand Reef are the likely source. "

In light of a drop of 20 to 90 feet in the water table around Superior since 2009 due mostly to Resolution pumping water out of 9 and 10 shafts, and a water loss in the creek due to a fracturing of the creek bed by Resolution's Never Sweat Tunnel and the proposed added even larger tunnel paralleling the Never Sweat that greatly increases the likelihood of even more water loss, this seems completely unacceptable without guaranteed mitigations on these issues.

I focused my reading on the Water Resources section 3.7, and a major concern of mine is the lack of discussion of the effects of climate change. It appears that there were many considerations taken into account regarding the limitations of the groundwater model, but at no point was it mentioned that a study of worsening droughts, that I believe are expected in the future of Arizona, was taken into account. While it is mentioned on page 306 that there were water declines consistent with long term droughts, there is no further comment as to how this issue may worsen as this project develops. I understand the dewatering of the area has been consistent, and the effects of block-caving have been highly analyzed for the production of this model, but I believe it is important to recognize the impact of our worsening climate and the ripple effect that will have in combination with the dewatering efforts for this mine. If I am incorrect, and these factors were taken into account, then I believe the EIS should include a more detailed discussion in this section as to how the groundwater modeling team took our worsening climate into consideration. Additionally, while I understand there are limitations to such extensive long-term modelling, it is concerning that there were no modelling techniques that were reliable for results less than 10’ in magnitude as discussed on page 301. It is mentioned that there will be monitoring wells placed in these locations of concern and that if necessary there will be mitigation implemented, but I think it would be valuable to the public if there was more of a discussion on the potential impact there may be at these sites.

"MIT02","Mitigation: Proposed New Mitigation","MIT","Mitigation","SALT's suggestions for mitigation to resolve some of these shortcomings arise from scoping comments submitted by SALT on March 24, 2016, and an addendum posted on July 14, 2016. While many of the issues covered therein relative to impacts anticipated over the projected life of the proposal and ways to compensate for them have been addressed, we feel that two key
aspects relative to mitigation have been ignored:
1) Although all of the land to be exchanged has great conservation value, much of it is too distant from the residents of the counties to be most impacted - and more particularly from those who have traditionally recreated on Oak Flat and its surroundings. Most exchange properties would be more difficult to access, and less appealing as well, to the overwhelming majority of the people whose lives would be most influenced throughout the workable life of the mine and
beyond.
2) It is notable that the National Association of County Commissioners and Supervisors has recently approved a statement requiring that mitigations be located within the state in which the damage is done. It is expected that they will refine that proclamation to declare that mitigations must be located within the same COUNTY at their next meeting. Both of these target the need to have mitigations as close to the site of the impacts as possible, an approach that SALT firmly supports.

As such, we specifically propose purchase and transfer to federal ownership a considerable portion of the lands suggested as ""Preserve"" in the Superstition Area Land Plan, an inclusive, 105-square mile study conducted by SALT in the early 2000's - with particular emphasis on adding land that would serve as a buffer between the south border of the Superstition Wilderness
Area and the expanding colossus that is metropolitan Phoenix. Toe suitability of these lands for conservation is also reviewed in a 2012 Sonoran Institute paper, ""Arizona State Trust Lands Conservation Profile: Superstition Mountains, An Urban Wilderness Opportunity"". Both of these documents are enclosed. [SEE COMMENT LETTER] This proposal was first enumerated in the July 14, 2016 addendum scoping suggestions to Tonto National Forest.)
We firmly believe that acquiring ""Preserve"" lands would go a long way toward mitigating the impacts of mining activities on the populations most directly affected. It would also have the lasting benefit of adding land that would serve as a buffer between the southern border of the Superstition Wilderness Area and the expanding colossus that is metropolitan Phoenix. Of all lands potentially available to be added as mitigation parcels for the Resolution Copper Mine, we strongly suggest that the Superstition Foothills best address what we hope we have persuasively argued are some of the shortcomings of the DEIS. It is not only near the site and in the same county as most mine activities, but has been studied and accepted as preferred conservation land by both the local population and by Pinal County in its 2007 Comprehensive Plan."

I read every word of the Environmental Impact Study. I read every word of the Draft Environmental -- or the Executive Summary. I read every word of the Draft Environmental Impact Study, but because I have no mining background, it was almost as if I was reading a foreign language. But there was a word I read over and over again. I wish I would have known this in advance. I would have counted the number of times I read it. The word is ""mitigation."" If you do not know what ""mitigation"" means, it means to make something less severe or less harsh. I believe in capitalism. I believe that every company has the right to make as much profit in the marketplace that their product will bear or bring. But no company, no one -- it is a moral issue. No company has the right to make one penny at the expense or the hurt of another human being, and when you look at those documents, it is absolutely frightening, and it's absolutely immoral to think that a company should be allowed to impact the San Carlos Apaches or anyone else, the people at Top-of-the-World that I came here to represent, and say to us, ""We heard you, but we're going to mitigate your loss."" The example I gave in Superior was if you were to take 100 pennies from me and you returned 10 of them, you mitigated my loss. You made it less severe, although it is still severe. If you were to return 20 or 30 or 50 or even 90 of my pennies, you have mitigated my loss, but I still have a loss. The moral thing that you have to think about and the thing that is morally right is not mitigation. It's restitution. ""Restitution"" means returning something back to the condition it was before it was changed. If Resolution Copper cannot do that, they should not be allowed to take one ounce of ore out of the ground."

"3.6.04","Air Quality: Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions","3.6","Section 3.6 - Air Quality"," Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 
In December 2014 the CEQ released “Revised Draft Guidance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Impacts” that describes how Federal departments and agencies should consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in their NEPA reviews. The guidance recommends a reference point of 25,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions on an annual basis, below which a quantitative analysis of GHG emissions is not recommended. 
The DEIS (DEIS, page 279) calculated that total greenhouse gas emissions would amount to 13,328 CO 2 equivalent tonnes/year, but only calculate emissions from fuel used for vehicles, process combustion sources, and employee traffic and deliveries. Just the transportation by rail of concentrate over a distance of 500 miles, by itself, could result in an annual carbon dioxide footprint comparable to the 25,000 metric ton threshold. The GPO also states that the mine will produce ore at an average rate of 132,000 tons per day with a maximum 165,000 tons per day. The electrical energy (kWh) required just to lift the mass of this ore thousands of feet to the surface corresponds to tens of thousands of metric tons of equivalent CO 2 per year, even without considering conveyor efficiency, etc. 
The quantitative analysis of the GHG emissions in accordance with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) guidelines must account for emissions from all sources attributable to the proposed mine, including mobile and stationary engines burning hydrocarbons within or going to and from the mine facilities, hydrocarbon fueled generators providing electricity to the mine, hydrocarbon fueled transportation of copper concentrates to remote smelting facilities, and loss of CO2 sequestration capacity due to destruction of vegetation. 
RCM’s main source of power would be a grid intertie to Salt River Project (“SRP”) power. RCM’s demand is likely to be between 260 MW and 1900 MW, and given that SRP power is roughly 85% powered by coal and natural gas, carbon emissions to power RCM will be extremely high. Carbon emissions from both power generation and the operation of all fueloperated mining machinery should have been calculated both annually and over the life of mine in the DEIS. These comments do not intend to go into detail about the scientific consensus as to why climate change is an enormous threat to humans, wildlife, and the economy, especially in desert climates facing water scarcity issues. It is, however, worth reiterating the numerous efforts of the federal government to combat climate change, such as the Clean Power Plan, the Bureau of Land Management proposed methane emissions reductions rule, the EPA methane emissions reduction rule, the Renewable Fuels Standard, renewable energy tax credits, and the vehicle gas mileage standards. Since the TNF is a federal agency, it has an obligation to align its priorities in the NEPA process to that of its sister agencies that are going to great lengths to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It should also follow CEQ’s guidance regarding how to consider climate change impacts in all NEPA processes.

The DEIS admits that in addition to the loss of recreational resources at Oak Flat, there will also be “potential loss of access to adjacent lands because movement across those areas would become prohibited.” (DEIS p. 495).

Mine Area – Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and a small parking lot just outside of RCM’s mining plant for the #9 and #10 shafts. The replacement access could be a parking lot and trail at locations agreed to by the relevant parties but outside the zone of mining operations. Upper Devils Canyon – Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and the old alignment of Highway 60 that heads easterly from just north of the Oak Flat campground. This is currently designated at FR 2438 and we wish to keep this as the access to these important rock climbing crags. Lower Devils Canyon – Hackberry Creek – Historical access has occurred from Magma Mine road and the FR 315 that heads south from it before turning back north to the current Mining operations on top of the Leap. The replacement access QCC is requesting involves the use and improvement of USFS FR 315 that departs Highway 177 south of Superior. Northern Devils Canyon – Historical access has occurred on the USFS FR 342 road that departs Highway 60 heading north to a power substation shortly east of the intersection of Magma Mine road and Highway 60."

"MIT01","Mitigation: General","MIT","Mitigation","CA-168: Streams and Riparian Ecosystem mitigation of impacts: Audubon would recommend the following projects to partially address the impacts of the tailings at Skunk Camp. 7 B Land Exchange Parcel The Nature Conservancy has worked with Resolution Copper on the management of 7B Ranch for nearly 15 years. We understand that The Nature Conservancy is continuing to work with Resolution Copper staff and consultants to address remaining stewardship projects on 7B Ranch that will set Bureau of Land Management (BLM) up for successful management of the property as part of the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (SPRNCA) going forward. We wholeheartedly agree with The Nature Conservancy’s recommendations for management projects that should be completed by Resolution before the transfer of 7B Ranch to BLM, including: 1. Bosque Restoration - The 7B Ranch has some of the Southwest’s best remaining forests of riparian mesquite trees (“mesquite bosques”). Several decades ago, 7B’s mesquite forests were cleared for agriculture uses. Over the years, mesquite trees have re-colonized many of these disturbed areas but have not regained the mature forest structure, plant diversity, or full set of habitat values of old-growth bosque stands. We recommend that a bosque restoration effort be initiated on the 7B, to help the site’s mesquite thickets regain the form and functions of mature bosque stands. We understand that The Nature Conservancy has indicated they would be available to advise on an experimental approach to this restoration project that measures progress toward specific desired characteristics of mature forest form, and could inform riparian mesquite restoration and management across the region. Restoration prior to BLM ownership would help maximize this site’s contributions to the mesquite bosque values within SPRNCA and be beneficial to wildlife, particularly Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, Lesser Long-nosed Bat, Desert Tortoise, and Gila Monsters. 2. Fencing to Protect Ecological and Archeological Features - Portions of 7B Ranch were fenced in 2011 which reduced cattle trespass and illegal woodcutting. However, there is additional fencing needed to manage 7B Ranch to the National Conservation Areas standards for SPRNCA. Much of the perimeter of 7B Ranch is not fenced and the river corridor is currently a through-route for vehicles and ATVs. Without additional fencing, some of the ecologically sensitive areas of 7B, including riparian areas important to birds, are susceptible to trespass. Most of the fence cutting and trespass issues originate from the river side of the ranch. We understand that The Nature Conservancy recommends repair and replacement fencing north of the Clark property, et al to Hwy 77 along the river, and River Road and fences on the west side of highway 77 between the highway and Camino Rio need to be repaired and/or replaced. Several cultural sites should be fenced prior to transfer. An inventory of these sites (21) was conducted by the Center for Desert Archeology (now Archeology Southwest) in 2010 and recommendations were made that describe fencing needs to protect the sites from vehicle use and actions needed to control areas of active erosion which could cause significant damage to the sites. In places a pipe rail fence may be necessary to prevent vehicle traffic. We understand that TNC can provide the Archeology Southwest recommendations and more detailed maps upon request. 3. Improving Hydrologic Function and Accelerating Naturalization of Disturbed Areas -The abandoned agricultural fields on the 7B have a network of degraded irrigation ditches and berms that should be retired by either pulling, filling, or breaching sections to enable more natural overland water flow across the floodplain. These ditches and berms overlap with the areas in need of Bosque Restoration and could be retired in conjunction with the bosque project. Retiring these ditches and berms will reduce downstream erosion risks in the San Pedro in the future and improve aquatic features on the 7B Ranch. Recent removal of dilapidated structures on 7B Ranch and associated access roads should be reclaimed to a more natural condition to deter trespass and prevent these areas from being re- colonized by invasive and exotic weeds, which could be detrimental to other restoration efforts on the 7B Ranch.

On at least two occasions, observations of an undifferentiated willow flycatcher have been made at Oak Flat. According to the Arizona Breeding Bird Atlas (2005), the peak migration for the SWFL is in early September with stragglers through mid-October. As both sightings of this species were made during September, is it possible that the SWFL is utilizing Oak Flat as a stop-over during migration. Westland Resources (2011) has also documented the federally threatened Western Yellow-billed Cuckoo (WYBC) in nearby Mineral Creek and possibly in Ga’an Canyon. According to Westland (2015) survey report, “A total of five YBCU detections were recorded during the 2015 survey: one from the Middle Ga’an Canyon transect and four from the Mineral Creek transect (Figures 3 and 5; Appendix B). The YBCU at Middle Ga’an Canyon was detected during the first survey (June 22). At Mineral Creek, three different YBCUs were detected during the third survey, on July 23, including two different YBCUs at one calling station and the third YBCU approximately 2,400 ft (732 m) up the canyon. The fourth detection at Mineral Creek was during the fourth survey (August 6), more than 1 mile down the canyon from the two that were detected together.” 

The DEIS indicates that areas of Ga’an Canyon and Mineral Creek which connect directly to proposed critical habitat for WYBC and SWFL along the Gila River could suffer from “reduced surface flows due to the upstream watershed decreasing in size as well as potential reductions in inputs of groundwater from project-related pumping. Potential habitat changes include loss of riparian habitat and a conversion of habitat to a drier, xeroriparian habitat. This could cause habitat to become unsuitable for nesting by the species” (Ch. 3, p. 473). Re: SWIFL, the DEIS also cites “removal of riparian vegetation, including potentially suitable nesting, foraging, and dispersal habitats and a corresponding localized reduction in insect prey populations used by the species” (Ch. 3, p.475). These impacts should be quantified and analyzed and considered along with cumulative impacts of groundwater removals in the context of new, independent hydrological analysis as discussed above. The Forest Service should undertake the following: 
Conduct field research to determine if, and the extent to which, the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher is utilizing the affected area. 
If the presence of SWFL is confirmed, habitat for this species should be mapped and quantified. 
Continue to conduct annual WYBC surveys. Expand WYBC survey areas to include oak woodland and mesquite habitats; particularly in bands surrounding major drainages and near water sources (surveys for WYBC conducted by Westland and the Tucson Audubon Society (2015) in “sky island” drainages have detected consistent WYBC occurrence and breeding behavior). Habitat for this species should be mapped and quantified. 
The EIS should analyze how the WYBC, and its habitat in the affected area, will be affected by mining facilities and operations, with special emphasis on impacts to riparian habitat informed by new, independent hydrological analysis. 
Consultation with the FWS, under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), should be conducted concerning both SWFL and WYBC.

However, substantial riparian zones are adjacent to the Near West TSF in Hewitt and Camp Canyons, and along portions of the Arizona Trail. These areas will likely be impacted by mining activities and are heavily utilized by migratory bird species as well as for nesting by passerines and raptors. 
Although the Migratory Bird Treaty Act Report for Baseline Hydrological and Geotechnical data Gathering Activities on the Tonto National Forest (2015) provides useful information, a full research study delineating the utilization of the TSFs migratory birds should be conducted.

AzGFD, and to a lesser extent the TNF, have data which specifically evaluates the rarity of birds in the TSFs. Both agencies should update their vulnerable species lists to reflect existing and future data. 
All habitat concerns previously stated for avifauna at Oak Flat should also be applied to species on the TSFs.

Although surveys were intended to be comprehensive, AGFD predicts that several species of SGCN reptiles went undetected during this effort. The GPO repeatedly assumes that water shortages rule out the possibility of many species inhabiting the AA. For example, no surveys were conducted for invertebrates in the Near West TSF because it was determined to lack perennial streams. However, springs, seeps and ephemeral water sources that potentially support indigenous biota are present in both Oak Flat and the TSFs. Furthermore, additional species may not have been detected as amphibians estivate during periods of drought. Although not observed in 2011, the lowland leopard frog--a federal Species of Concern, a 1A SGCN, and a Forest Service Sensitive species--has been observed in both Ga’an Canyon and in nearby stock tanks.

"3.8.05","Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species: Special Status Wildlife Species","3.8","Section 3.8 - Wildlife and Special Status Wildlife Species","In 2000 AzGFD biologists surveyed the section of Mineral Creek immediately downstream of the confluence with Ga’an Canyon. Three species of fish including the native Gila longfin dace, green sunfish and the federally endangered Gila Chub were collected. A subsequent survey by AZGF in 2002 found that Mineral Creek was “totally devoid of fish”; it is unknown what caused this extirpation. In August of 2006, AZGF biologists restocked Mineral Creek with Gila longfin dace. This species was present when Westland Resources biologists surveyed Mineral Creek in November of 2007. Currently, the Gila longfin dace is considered to be a Sensitive species by the FS. Although no native fish species were discovered in Ga’an Canyon in 2007 (Westland 2009) it is possible that the pools in Ga’an Canyon could once again support substantial populations of native fish species. According to the DEIS, Gila chub were not found in any of the recent surveys conducted for this species in Mineral Creek, up to 2017. This prompts the statement that, “As this area is not currently occupied habitat, potential impacts on surface water and groundwater would have no potential impact on the species” (Ch. 3, p. 476). It is not necessary for habitat to be occupied in order for there to be negative impacts to a listed species. Indeed, recovery depends upon listed species being able to recolonize areas that they once lived in but have been extirpated from. There is certainly the possibility for this to occur in the AA, with designated critical habitat in nearby Mineral Creek, which connects directly to Ga’an Canyon. The TNF must analyze the proposed action’s potential harm to this dynamic with regard to recovery of Gila chub. "

We reiterate the previous groundwater modeling has already been shown to be fatally flawed, and new, thorough independent study is necessary to properly understand and analyze the effects of the likely massive drawdown of the aquifer created by project-related groundwater pumping, subsidence, consequent changes in hydrological function, and related impacts to aquatic species such as Gila chub.

However, the UN Declaration of Indigenous People's Rights (UNDRIP) should be considered in more detail . While not binding in the official US government view, nonetheless it is recognized by the US that the UN Declaration of Indigenous People's Rights (UNDRIP) has a moral force to consider and act upon. Article 8 Section 1 states that: ""Indigenous peoples and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture."" Article 11 Section 1 states: ""Indigenous peoples have the right to practice and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature."" The actions described in the Executive Summary would seem to irreparably interfere with the ability of the Apache people to practice their religion and amounts to assimilation and destruction of culture. It also irreparably interferes with the archaeological and historical site of Oak Flat for them along with any artifacts or art at or beneath the ground of this site. As an Episcopal priest, the religious implications and interference with religious liberty posed by this environmental action is of significant concern to me and other priests as well. Hopefully you can find a way to preserve this sacred site for the Apache. Clearly nothing can replace Oak Flat and the best and most ethical solution is to not allow the mine. If for some reason this cannot be achieved due to legislation, then UNDRIP would indicate that significant redress (monetary or otherwise) is owed for what is being forcibly taken from the Apache. In searching the document, I could not find anything addressing these concerns raised by UNDRIP or any reference to UNDRIP. Would this study consider UNDRIP in the implications of this proposed mining project? Hopefully this study will consider the implications from UNDRIP. If tragically no other means is found to preserve the religious liberty of the Apache at Oak Flat, then I hope it accounts for the redress which would be morally and ethically owed to the Apache from the environmental impacts of this proposed mining operation.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The DEIS says it used “best practices” for geochemical characterization by using methods from INAP and those required by ADEQ (p. 372). However, two methods used will underestimate acid generation and contaminant leaching potential: the Sobek method (Sobek et al., 1978) and the synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP; US EPA, 1994). The original Sobek method (Sobek et al., 1978) could overestimate acid generation potential because it uses total sulfur rather than sulfide sulfur. However, for the Resolution Copper Project, only the sulfide sulfur was used (MWH Americas, Inc., 2013, p. 2-4). Use of the original Sobek method in this case is more likely to overestimate neutralization potential because of the pH endpoint (Maest et al., 2005). The Modified Sobek method is recommended over the original Sobek method by INAP (2009) and the Nevada Bureau of Land Management (2013). Because most of the test results for Resolution Copper showed that nearly all the mine rock samples, all the PAG tailings, and over half the “NPAG” tailings were potentially acid-generating (PAG; DEIS, p. 372 and 373), the use of the older Sobek method is not particularly concerning for the DEIS. However, it should not be used in the field to distinguish PAG and NPAG rocks for different placement and different mitigation approaches; instead, the Modified Sobek method should be used. No information is provided in the DEIS about methods used in the field to distinguish PAG and NPAG rock? (read project description etc.). An important question is why the DEIS calls the “NPAG” tailings (scavenger tailings) NPAG when half are PAG or acid generating (DEIS, p. 373). The SPLP test will underestimate the leaching potential of mined materials, especially in arid areas like southern Arizona, because it calls for a 20:1 solution:solid ratio (Maest et al., 2005). The meteoric water mobility procedure (MWMP) is recommended by the Bureau of Land Management for the State of Nevada, another arid state in the western US. The MWMP has a solution:solid ratio of 1:1 and should have been used by the proponents to evaluate the short-term contaminant leaching potential of mined materials. As noted in the DEIS (p. 381), a drawback of relying only on the SPLP test is that it is usually conducted on unweathered fresh core or lab-created tailings when in the field over time, these mined materials will weather. As especially sulfidic mine materials weather, secondary sulfate salts are formed that can release metal(oid)s, sulfate, and acidity rapidly during a storm event or as waters rise into mined areas; the effects of this rapid dissolution are rarely taken into account when predicting mine waste behavior (Maest and Nordstrom, 2017 and references contained therein). Results from the SPLP tests for NPAG and PAG tailings are presented in Table 3.7.2-9 of the DEIS. The concentrations predicted for PAG tailings runoff should be higher than those for NPAG tailings, but they are not, as shown in table 3.7.2-9. This is an indication that either the SPLP tests include too much dilution or that the SPLP results in the table are not taken from PAG and NPAG samples. For example, predicted concentrations of antimony, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, silver, thallium, and zinc in the table are identical, and oddly, sulfate and total  dissolved solids concentrations are higher in the NPAG than in the PAG sample. The report from Verburg and Harvey (2008) is cited as the source for the SPLP results in the table. Upon reviewing the report, no sample identified as 7/7A 7C is included in the report, and the report is not about SPLP results – it is about humidity cell test (HCTs – much longer-term leach tests) results for six tailings samples. This discrepancy needs to be corrected. The inclusion of SPLP results in the DEIS (see Table 3.7.2-9) is confusing because it implies that the results were used to calculate stormwater runoff concentrations. However, it appears that SPLP results were not used for tailings runoff water quality predictions (Eary, 2018a) and barrel and early HCT results were instead used."
"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","A more important issue is the lack of geochemical testing for the lone proposed mitigation measure for PAG tailings. The PAG tailings (that is, the pyritic or cleaner tailings) would be subaqueously deposited because “this limits oxygen from interacting with the concentration of sulfides in the PAG tailings, minimizing and preventing water quality problems (acid rock drainage)” and the NPAG tailings would “eventually encapsulate the PAG tailings.” (DEIS, p. 41). However, no testing was done to determine if depositing the PAG tailings under water would minimize or prevent the formation of acidic drainage. Because submerging PAG tailings is the only mitigation measure proposed for minimizing acid drainage at the source, saturated column tests on tailings should be conducted. The testing will require months to a year or more to complete and evaluate."
"3.7.04","Water Resources: Water Quality (Groundwater / Surface Water)","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Saturated column (SC) testing on core from the proposed block cave area was conducted. The tests were designed to mimic what would happen when the block-cave zone refloods after mining (DEIS, p. 372). The saturated column tests used spent material from the humidity cell tests (HCTs) from 14 samples for a total of 12 weeks. The number of pore volumes of water flushed through the column tests was estimated to represent thousands of years of waters moving through the block cave area after mining ceases (MWH Americas, 2013, p. 3-4). The spent HCT material was presumably used to ensure the samples were weathered before testing began to better simulate actual field conditions after mining. The results for pH, total acidity, sulfate, and copper are shown in Table 1 for the last week of HCT testing and the first and last week of SC testing. In the report with the results (MWH Americas, Inc., 2013), the results for copper were not presented in the main body of the report but were buried in two appendices. The results in Table 1 show that all tests with acidic HCT endpoints had even lower pH and higher acidity
values for week 1 of SC testing, indicating that the salts that remained on the spent HCT material contained latent acidity. For the samples with neutral pH HCT endpoints, little change in pH or acidity resulted in the SC tests. All SC tests had higher sulfate concentrations at the end of the first week of SC
testing regardless of pH values, indicating that elevated sulfate concentrations would be released into groundwater when the block cave area experiences rising water levels during closure/post-closure and salts on the surfaces of the block caved material are dissolved. Similarly, all tests, regardless of pH, had higher copper concentrations at the end of the first week 1 of SC testing, showing that rising groundwater would also greatly increase copper concentrations in the block cave area. Only two of the eight SC tests that were acidic had copper concentrations below detection at end of the test; the other six had decreasing concentrations over time, but values were still well above aquatic life criteria for copper. This result suggests that movement of block cave groundwater toward streams could adversely affect groundwater-dependent ecosystems. The results show that once the block cave area is inundated with rising groundwater, a flush of acid, copper, and sulfate will occur because of the dissolution of acidic metal-sulfate secondary salts. This flush of contaminants would contaminant groundwater in the block cave zone and could also affect groundwater-dependent ecosystems and the subsidence lake that would likely form above the collapsed ground surface, as discussed in the following section.

The proposed mining is expected to result in an enormous collapsed and fractured area predicted to be 7,000 feet deep with an overlying crater that will develop starting in year 6 of mining (DEIS, p. ES-3, p. 26). The crater is expected to be between 800 to 1,115 ft deep and approximately 1.8 miles wide at the surface of Oak Flat (DEIS, p. ES-3). The collapsed and cratered area will likely result in flow reductions in Devil’s Canyon and Queen Creek and the loss of seeps and springs in the Superior area (DEIS, p. 26). The two competing geochemistry models presented in the DEIS have radically different water quality predictions for groundwater quality in the block cave zone, as shown in Table 2. Once explanation for the discrepancy is that chemical weathering of wall rock and mineralized fractured rock in the collapsed block-cave zone is assumed in the Eary (2018b) model to not supply any chemical load to the sump water (DEIS, p. 350). However, the results presented MWH Americas (2013) and interpreted in the section Block Cave Groundwater After Mining Ceases in this memo completely contradict that assumption and show that acidity, copper, and sulfate can be released from oxidized mineralized rock in the block cave zone when water levels rise.  [See comment letter for table]

The DEIS admits that after closure, the reflooded block-cave zone could have poor water quality; however, it concludes that a lake in the subsidence crater is not anticipated, and no other exposure pathways exist for this water (DEIS p. ES-24, pdf 31). The ad hoc “Groundwater Modeling Workgroup” provided input to the Forest Service, which concluded that “the presence of a subsidence lake was speculative and not reasonably foreseeable, and as such it would therefore be inappropriate to analyze in the EIS” (DEIS, p. 376). The types of participants in the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup is described in the DEIS (p. 296), but their qualifications are not. The potential to form a subsidence lake in the crater is rejected in the DEIS but is discussed in detail in Prucha (2019). A figure showing its location and other important groundwater flow paths is reproduced in Figure 1. The DEIS concludes that “it is not possible to predict the details necessary to conduct even a rudimentary analysis of effects” (DEIS, p. 378) and does not make a prediction of the lake’s water quality. Prediction of the lake water quality is no more uncertain than all the other predictions made in the EIS and in some ways less complicated because all potential inputs and evaporation rates have already been estimated or can be estimated (see DEIS, Table 3.7.2-8). The range of potential concentrations in block cave groundwater could be used to estimate the
range of concentrations in the subsidence lake and compared to water quality standards. The causes for the large discrepancy between block cave groundwater quality end members should also be better described in the DEIS. One possible cause is that Eary (2018b, p. 16) used the last three weeks of HCT results to estimate rates. Using results from the last weeks of testing will generally underestimate rates, assuming the tests were conducted for long enough to reach “steady state” conditions. Instead, a range of rates should be used, including maximum rates associated with maximum increase in iron and sulfate and maximum pH decreases (Maest and Nordstrom, 2017). Also, figures showing the HCT results are not presented in the DEIS or in any associated report that I could find. Examining the changes in concentrations in the tests visually is an important aid in understanding reactions occurring in the tests that will also occur in the field.
The formation and quality of a subsidence lake should be re-evaluated in a revised DEIS, including in the cumulative effects section because of the potential to pull water from the Magma Mine workings into the block cave zone, as described in Prucha (2019). The potential impact to birds and groundwaterdependent
ecosystems should also be evaluated.

GDEs would have shown up as impacted, needing mitigation. Instead only those delineated by uncertain predicted 10-ft drawdown used (at 200 years) to define potentially impacted GDEs.
•	Evaluating drawdowns in shallow aquifer at 200 years, or 148 years post-closure, severely limits the number/magnitude of impacted GDEs because the groundwater model still hasn’t fully recovered by this point. With a future fractured and highly permeable pathway that develops between the shallow Apache Leap Aquifer (ALT) and DEEP aquifer zone (in Resolution Graben), relatively rapid drainage of ALT would dewater GDEs over the short- term, as it fills voids in the deep aquifer. But then, ALT water levels will eventually return to pre-mining conditions. Choosing 200 years limits the understanding of time-varying impacts extent/magnitude.
•	By including continued dewatering of the deep GW aquifer in No Action alternative groundwater model predictive long-term simulations, and then subtracting drawdowns from LOM and post-closure simulations, RCM consultants have effectively biased the magnitude and extent of mine impacts on GDEs towards the low side, or the opposite of conservatively high impacts (see see page 3, paragraph 4, Garrett and Newell, 2018). At a minimum, predicted drawdowns should have been calculated from pre-mining conditions, as these are the levels to which shallow ALT aquifer groundwater levels will eventually recover to. This is known without even using the highly uncertain groundwater modeling results.
•	Water quality of the ‘perched’ upper Devils Canyon drainage doesn’t appear to confirm it is disconnected to shallow ALT aquifer, which has likely dropped simply due to the substantial and long-term historical pumping, compounded by the more current 2009-present shaft 9/10 dewatering. The assessment of which GDEs to include, or discard from further analysis (i.e., discarded if perched, vs. connected to impacted ALT or Deep aquifers) appears to be based on relatively recent hydrologic data (i.e., collected after significant unrecovered historical drawdowns (1910-1996) and superimposed re-drawdown of levels post-2009 (i.e., shaft 9/10 dewatering). No analysis of 1910 to 1996 dewatering/recovery is presented in the DEIS, or supporting documents. Knowing how much drawdown has already occurred in the GDE locations/segments would have likely significantly increased the number of GDEs potentially impacted.
•	A key question is what additional GDEs, or even those omitted because the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup decided they didn’t exhibit “persistent presence of water, year-to-year and season-to-season” (stated page 296, paragraph 3 in the DEIS), would have been valid locations had effects of past/current pumping been removed (recovered)? GDEs should have been defined based on pre-mining groundwater conditions, where the long-term pumping influence at Magma Mine, and RCM pumping since 2009 don’t bias identification of persistent discharge at springs/along streams towards the low side. Because it is unclear how the estimated pre-mining groundwater levels were determined without calibration data, the DEIS should have conservatively identified all GDEs, within uncertain range of flow conditions.

years) is due to perched groundwater conditions (see page 28, paragraph 2 in Montgomery and Associates, 2017).

2.2.1	Issues with Overall Methodology Used to Evaluate Impacts

A general ‘industry-standard’ approach to modeling hydrologic impacts is lacking. A general approach used to develop predictions via use of numerical models was never presented, though many guidance documents are readily available online as noted by BGC, 2018d2 in Section 2.2 (Description of Best Practices). The most useful, current and relevant to assessing mining impacts is provided by Wels, 20121, which shows a standard modeling process on Figure 1. Clearly defined questions related to potential impacts and modeling objectives should have been presented, particularly how groundwater impacts affect surface flows, and vice-versa. These were not evaluated in this DEIS, or supporting documents.

Implications of the lack of a clear overall approach to hydrologic impact evaluations include:

•	A major flaw in modeling conducted in this DEIS is that groundwater modeling was done in apparent isolation from surface water modeling, yet surface water clearly recharges groundwater (losing segments), and groundwater clearly discharges to surface streams as baseflow, or via springs. In other words, surface water recharge to groundwater (losing stretches) was not included in the groundwater modeling as a boundary condition, and vice versa. Including this 2-way flow is essential to realistically and accurately assessing mining impacts on surrounding GDEs (and surface water ecosystems).
•	A formal code(s) selection process that demonstrated tools selected for the analyses adequately answer key questions/meet objectives wasn’t performed. These issues are addressed in more detail in Section 2.4 below.
•	Once models were created, the important feedback loops shown on Figure 1 from model calibration to conceptualization and data collection doesn’t appear to have been considered. In other words, obvious datagaps identified during modeling weren’t addressed.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.3	Conceptualization inadequate/incomplete.
Conceptualization is critical to supporting and developing numerical models of flow as described in numerous modeling guidelines, some of which are cited by BGC, 2018d in their review of the Resolution Copper Mine (RCM) groundwater model. Kolm and Van Der Heijde, 19963  describe a detailed approach to conceptualization and characterization of hydrologic systems, as outlined on Figure 2. Though BGC, 20192 attempts to review the characterization of the groundwater system (Section 3.4), and even points out “that building a conceptual model is a crucial step before building a numerical model”, the WSP, 2019 report fails to describe a defensible baseline 3-dimensional conceptual flow model (or future post-closure conceptualization) showing the coupled surface water-groundwater system flows in any detail, using groundwater flow arrows in each aquifer, estimated discharge (at springs, seeps, streams) and recharge areas and rates as described in various reports5.
Discussion of characterization and conceptualization of both surface water and groundwater flows, and flow interactions between them over the entire mine footprint is confusing, poorly presented and missing important details. For example:
a)	The complex hydrogeologic system, especially around the proposed mine area exhibits numerous offsetting faults and multiple tilted hydrogeologic units, and is illustrated in only a single West-East cross-sections (Figure 2.2) groundwater modeling report (WSP, 2019). Yet, critical conceptual details are missing, fundamental to defining an appropriate conceptual flow model (or multiple conceptual models, given subsurface complexity) of the entire potentially-impacted system. For example:
b)	Perched zones are hypothesized in various supporting documents, and used to explain how many GDEs are disconnected from mine-impacted groundwater drawdowns. But no data, characterization of the lateral/vertical extents, or conceptualization of such features or associated flows are presented in the DEIS, or supporting documents. This represents a key error in conceptual modeling (see Section 4.6, Wels et al, 20121). The groundwater flow model further appears to have omitted these perched zones (i.e., in upper Devils Canyon, above segment DC10.5), which should have shown lower recharge to deeper aquifer zones (see WSP, 2019, Figure 3.6), but don’t appear to have been incorporated into the flow model (see Appendix B HGU Material Property Values, WSP, 2019).
c)	Geothermal influence not included in the conceptual flow model, but may be important to evaluating long-term post-closure flow conditions within the subsidence area (i.e., density- driven flows, and water quality impacts).
d)	The well-established industry practice (as defined in the flow chart on Figure 2 by Kolm and Van der Heijde, 1996) of going from raw data (i.e., borehole/well data) to characterization, for example of interpolated groundwater surface elevations for perched, shallow and deep aquifer units, over the mine-impacted area (including all TSF alternatives, West Plant, Superior, Queens Creek, MARRCO corridor etc), to conceptualization of flows (both vertical and lateral) within aquifer units, along faults,discharge to surface, flows between surface water-groundwater, recharge from precipitation and runoff etc, is largely absent.
e)	Description and illustration of the future conceptual model around the mine, or Alternative #6 TSF area (i.e., baseline conditions) were never provided. Hydrogeologic characterization associated with Alt 6 TSF is largely missing, in Dripping Springs Wash – i.e., they state “It is not known at this time whether these faults act as preferential flowpaths, or low permeability boundaries for groundwater flow”
f)	Given the high degree of complexity in the subsurface over the mine footprint, a realistic range of alternative conceptual models should have been considered in the modeling to account for substantial uncertainty in virtually all model input. Conceptual model uncertainty typically accounts for most uncertainty in subsequent numerical model predictions. Neuman and Weiranga, 20035 describe in detail how to incorporate alternative conceptual models into formal uncertainty analyses. Typically, conceptual model uncertainty dominates overall predictive uncertainty and as such should have been more fully assessed in the DEIS modeling evaluations.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Several, independent hydrologic modeling efforts were conducted in the DEIS, including the following:

1)	3D Groundwater Modeling – Modflow-surfact6 mine-area evaluations
2)	Hydrologic (Surface water) model – AWBM7 Monthly Hydrologic Model
3)	ADWR’s Salt River Valley (SRV) Groundwater Flow Model – Modflow.
4)	2D Conceptual TSF Seepage modeling8 – SEEP/W

No Formal Code Selection Conducted. A formal code selection process9 should have been conducted to identify appropriate codes that are able to simulate all required processes needed to fully assess mine impacts on surrounding hydrology, and more importantly, to define required calibration targets for specific EIS impact assessments (i.e,. required predictive accuracy). Section 5 in Wels, 20121 provides details on conducting a formal groundwater model selection, even including a flow chart.

The MODFLOW-Surfact groundwater modeling tool used by WSP, 2019 to assess mining impacts at GDEs within the entire mine footprint fails to model important physical processes (i.e., overland surface runoff processes, distributed recharge and evapotranspiration dynamics, stream hydrodynamics, and stream-aquifer dynamics etc.) necessary to simulate physically realistic and defensible mine impacts on surrounding GDEs. Much more robust modeling tools are readily available, but weren’t considered because a formal, industry standard code selection process wasn’t conducted, where all modeling objectives/needs are carefully defined and evaluated against capabilities of available codes.

Fully integrated hydrologic/hydraulic codes should have been considered for more robust and physically realistic impact evaluation. These codes don’t suffer major shortcomings such as: 1) attempting to run one model in isolation (i.e., the groundwater flow model), then attempting to couple non-dynamic results to a separate spreadsheet tool, when the flows between groundwater and surface water is complex, dynamic and spatially variable, and 2) they simulate all relevant physical flow processes and don’t require unrealistic and highly uncertain boundary conditions.
Many options are commercially-available10 and have been applied to mine water balance projects, worldwide for many years.

1)	Use of Modflow to explicitly model the effect of faults is inappropriate. Codes like FEFLOW permit actual simulation of flow along faults as planar features. Modflow-Surfact required specifying model cells (with variable dimensions unrelated to actual fault planes/zones in the field). Hydrogeologic characterization of flows along and/or across faults is largely missing – and therefore highly uncertain.

2)	The variable saturation, finite element modeling code, FEFLOW, developed by DHI-WASY would have allowed a much higher resolution near critical streams, while decreasing resolution in area of less interest. This would have met stated objectives.

3)	Conceptualization should have included heat transfer, due to geothermal waters encountered during construction of shaft 10, which drive density-dependent flows. FEFLOW includes the ability to simulate heat flow, and also has the ability to directly simulate 3-dimensional geochemical modeling based on PHREEQC, similar to its use in the USGS PHAST code.

4)	Fully integrated, or coupled, physically-based, fully-distributed hydrologic (and hydraulic) codes have been available for decades and would have allowed RCM consultants to directly simulate the complicated, baseline and mine-impacted coupled surface water-groundwater dynamic flow system response in a robust, realistic way.

The authors attempted to estimate spatial distributions of recharge, which is a complex spatially distributed, and dynamic process, using an undocumented method. However, fully integrated codes like the USGS GSFLOW code, DHI’s code MIKESHE/MIKE11 or even
 Aquanty’s Hydrogeosphere code actually simulate important processes like dynamic, spatially-distributed recharge, surface runoff and channelized hydrodynamics, which are dynamically coupled to subsurface flow (i.e., coupled to a modflow equivalent code). The MIKESHE code was used to simulate hourly impacts of climate change and stream temperature changes associated with Pebble Mine impacts in southeastern Alaska11.

5)	Simulate ET and Recharge processes more realistically:

•	ET boundary condition – Instead of using the original MODFLOW EVT package which treats ET loss as a linear function of hydraulic head (not very physically realistic), consider using MODFLOW Riparian ET package (available for MODFLOW-2005) http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/tm6a39/pdf/tm6a39.pdf, or even the ETS package (http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr00466).
•	Recharge boundary condition – See the following publication on the Basin Characterization Method (BCM) currently used by the USGS in a number of southwestern basins. (http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1703/b/pp1703b.pdf) or

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.5	Model Setup/Assumptions Flawed.
A number of issues were identified with the setup of the groundwater flow and TSF seepage flow models that severely limit confidence in a realistic range of mine impacts on the surrounding hydrologic system, including water quality impacts.


2.5.1	Seepage Model Setup Issues
Seepage modeling of Alternative 6 Tailings Storage Facility (TSF)12 is problematic for several reasons, and results should not be relied upon in the DEIS:

•	Data required to conduct realistic seepage modeling are inadequate, and introduce significant uncertainty in comparing different TSF alternatives, especially related to estimating valid and defensible impacts of each proposed TSF on the surrounding baseline hydrologic and water quality conditions. In effect, baseline conditions and characterization were not evaluated, but should have been in this DEIS to provide adequate comparison of alternatives.

•	Only 2D simulations using the SEEP/W code were performed, when the TSF and underlying hydrogeologic system clearly exhibits 3-dimensional features which would influence groundwater-seepage flows and interaction.

•	The model is not based on actual site data and 3-dimensional characterization of subsurface and surface hydrologic system. Instead, modeling is based on a simplified 2-d 'conceptual' configuration which doesn’t account for important features such as variable thickness of alluvium (i.e., likely thickest along actual drainages, but thinner at TSF perimeter, away from drainage thalweg). The DEIS should assess likely impacts in this area, using actual data to constrain the 3-d hydrogeology, and local groundwater and surface water conditions. A detailed and complete 3-dimensional conceptual flow model is not presented which shows how the proposed TSF interacts with the natural groundwater and surface water flow system. Centering the TSF over Dripping Springs Wash is where groundwater flow would be expected to be upwards.

•	A no flow boundary condition is placed at the surface water divide to the north, but subsurface data is missing in this area to confirm this also coincides with a groundwater divide.

•	Effects of faults on groundwater-seepage flows is not assessed in the area, despite the relatively high density of faults clearly evident in exposed rocks to the west, showing notable offsets and likely influential in controlling local groundwater flows below unconsolidated alluvium.
•	No effort was made to assess impacts of stream routing/diversions around the TSF, and effects of streambed infiltration on shallow groundwater-seepage flows, and associated fate/transport of impaired waters downstream.
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.5.2	Groundwater Flow Model Setup Issues

Several issues were identified with the groundwater flow6 model setup and are described here.

Model Extent and Boundary Inappropropiate. Just based on reported results using the 10- foot contours, it’s clear predictions of mine drawdowns are impacted by the model boundary condition. Had a 1-foot drawdown contour been reported in the modeling, boundary effects would have likely been far more extensive. it would likely show a much greater degree of boundary impact on the model. This boundary should have been extended outward in all directions to:

•	avoid influencing internal calculations. This is standard industry practice13.

•	simulate flow conditions for at least preferred Alternative 6 TSF, and downgradient impacts to Gila River, so that:

•	fate and transport modeling of seepage from the TSF could have been properly assessed in Dripping Springs Wash,

•	2D seepage modeling8 could have used realistic/calibrated groundwater boundary conditions as boundary conditions on simulations estimating seepage through the TSF.

•	permit estimating impacts down to at least 1’ drawdown, which likely extend much further out
than estimated maximum extent shown in the DEIS (see Figure 3.7.1-3)

Inappropriate Stream-Aquifer Setup/Assumptions. Use of MODFLOW drain package to simulate stream discharge is in appropriate for several reasons:

•	It only permits removal of groundwater from the model, but no streambed recharge in losing river reaches. This is a major flaw in the model setup and non-standard. Many other high profile recent mining DEIS modeling efforts (i.e., Pebble Mine, Rosemont Mine) have utilized the much more robust MODFLOW stream routing packages (STR1, STR2), which actually dynamically route baseflow discharge from upper reaches to lower reaches, which permits downstream recharge in areas where underlying aquifer heads are lower than the dynamically calculated stream stage. Not accounting for streambed recharge results in either under- simulation of heads in critical GDE areas, or incorrect adjustment of other parameters (i.e., reduction in hydraulic conductivity in stream areas) to compensate for lack of focused, higher streambed recharge.
•	Drain ‘hydraulic resistance’ or drain conductance was set ‘sufficiently high’ (see page 23, paragraph 5, WSP, 2019) so they would not exhibit resistance to flow. Even if it were acceptable to use one-way flow drain discharge to simulate river discharge, the standard modeling approach is to define drain conductance values as a primary calibration parameter. The modelers here have effectively removed a key parameter value from the calibration process, and specifying high conductance prior to calibration is not valid and should be based on actual field-based measurements and careful calibration (but using a river package, and not a ‘drain’ package).

•	No attempt appears to have been made to couple the MODFLOW drain discharge distribution with surface water modeling (BGC, 2018), so that predicted impacts due to mining on surface water flows could be better simulated, despite simulating at a monthly time period.

Inappropriate Seepage Setup/Assumptions. Springs and seeps do not appear to have been simulated as discharge points in the Modflow model. It would been appropriate, and is typical, to use the Modflow Drain package to simulate discharge at these areas. Not simulating discharge in these areas would cause the model to over-estimate heads otherwise controlled by discharge to seeps/springs.

Areal Recharge Specification Inappropriate
•	Many books have been written on the subject – it is complex, but critical to acceptable calibration (Healy and Scanlon, 201014). The USGS15 has developed a commonly used method called the Basin Characterization Method (BCM) to estimate recharge based on many known factors.
•	Factors that Schlumberger indicates control recharge (slope and geologic ‘infiltration multipliers) are only some of the factors actually determining recharge at any given cell. No references to this estimation of recharge are provided, yet this is a critical model input, typically strongly correlated with hydraulic conductivity, and influencing calibration.
•	Recharge zonation into upper and lower zones, and ‘enhanced recharge’ zones along Queen Creek and Devils Canyon (see paragraph 1, page 25, WSP, 2019) is arbitrary and unjustified, and has significant effects on calibration. WSP, 2019 states “These zones were conceptualized to concentrate runoff that would lead to higher infiltration rates, which were set at 4% and 8% for the lower and higher elevation areas, respectively. As runoff is concentrated in these areas, water is stored in surface soils longer, providing more time for infiltration and hence a higher recharge rate.” This statement is physically incorrect, as streambed recharge occurs only along streams, as indicated in Simmers, 198816. Moreover, the aerial recharge specified in the model (Figure 3.6, WSP, 2019) incorrectly assigns high recharge within a nearly ½ mile wide zone around each of these key mine-impacted drainages, which causes too much recharge in these areas, and in turn reduces mine impacts. If the model had been calibrated against surface flows (both discharge and recharge), along with a proper number of wells along each of these drainages, recharge in these areas would have been much better constrained. This is a major problem in the DEIS, which focuses on assessing mine-impacts to these very drainages.
Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) from Groundwater is Not Simulated
•	Calculation of AET is in fact, a critical water balance component in most hydrologic models, and a complicated function of complex climate inputs (generally accounted for in more robust estimates of PET, like the standard ASCE or FAO Penman-Monteith equation17), soil properties (i.e., soil types, layering, moisture contents, unsaturated zone hydraulic properties), precipitation, groundwater depths with time, and vegetation properties (i.e., leaf area index, root depth density with depth, crop coefficients, types, saturation, residual and field and wilting point moistures, canopy properties etc). In single-process codes like MODFLOW, AET is typically simulated either using the standard EVT package, which calculates AET on a cell- by-cell basis, as a function of groundwater depth, maximum evapotranspiration rates, and plant root depths, or by specifying net-recharge, where AET is calculated on a cell by cell basis, and then removed from applied recharge. Importantly, assessing sub-daily impacts at specific locations in the model is strongly influenced by correct calculation of AET. In riparian zones, groundwater loss to AET and baseflow discharge compete against each other, as a function of groundwater depth. Consequently, without directly simulating AET in all cells, groundwater models likely overestimate baseflow loss, and incorrectly parameterize stream- aquifer conductance values. Omitting this critical process (a conceptual error, especially in semi-arid climates) prevents estimation of mine impacts on phreatophyte-dependent riparian vegetation. This is a major oversight in the DEIS evaluation of impacts at GDEs.


Modeling of Groundwater Fate/Transport from Mine not Considered. WSP 20196 groundwater model sensitivity analysis provided a range of expected drawdowns, despite not being produced by a robust predictive uncertainty analysis, or by adjusting more realistic changes to key model inputs (i.e., distributed parameter and combinations of parameters). The Block Cave Geochemical modeling (Eary, 201818) apparently did not evaluate or discuss predictive uncertainty, which could be quite high due to the high number of input parameters (beyond groundwater flow model), and high uncertainty in inputs/assumptions.


Subsidence Not Evaluated – Salt River Valley ADWR Model. No effort was made to estimate subsidence in the important Phoenix AMA area, though drawdowns are estimated and subsidence potential acknowledged. Garrett 2018 → states:
On Page 9, paragraph 2:
 “Long-term drawdown from Desert Wellfield pumping of 10 to 30 feet is modeled to occur in the nearby known subsidence areas. Any groundwater pumping within a groundwater basin with known subsidence has the potential to contribute to that subsidence, including the pumping from the Desert Wellfield.
Further detailed analysis is not feasible beyond noting the potential for any pumping to contribute to drawdown and subsidence. Subsidence effects are a basin-wide phenomenon, and analytical tools do not exist to isolate the impact from one individual pumping source on subsidence.”

The Modflow Subsidence package19 (2003) could easily have been used to assess likely impacts of MARRCO pumping on subsidence.
Evaluation of future drawdown at surrounding wells not conducted. About 285 wells (ADWR database) would be impacted within the 10’ drawdown (at 200 years), and more than 400 wells would probably be impacted by drawdowns of at least 1 foot. This is easily done with a properly calibrated model and predictive uncertainty analysis. Newell and Garrett 201820 state, page 10, paragraph 3 “In lieu of analyzing individual wells, typical wells in key communities were analyzed using the groundwater flow model, including wells near Top-of-the-World (using well HRES-06 as a proxy), wells within the town of Superior (using well DHRES-16 as a proxy), and wells near Boyce Thompson Arboretum (using the Gallery well as a proxy).” Proxies give a misleading sense of impacts to surrounding wells because drawdown is spatially complex. The DEIS should have evaluated a range of maximum drawdowns (given uncertainty in predictions) in all wells, regardless of the amount.





"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.6	Model Calibrations Unreliable
A number of issues identified with model calibration are summarized here.

2.6.1	Calibration Approach Flawed and Non-unique

Calibrating groundwater flow models to only hydraulic heads, which are spatially biased with higher density near the proposed mine, and sparse further from the mine is well known to produce non-unique solutions.21 The non-unique solution is typical of groundwater models where recharge and hydraulic conductivity values are highly correlated22. Doherty and Hunt, 201023 indicate that non-unique solutions can be addressed by adding other types of calibration data (i.e., surface water discharge, water quality data etc).

Representing seasonally dynamic gaining/losing surface water flows as ‘drain’ cells in the groundwater model, fails to account for stream recharge in losing reaches. This in turn forces incorrect adjustments of hydraulic parameter values to compensate, and further degrades calibration and therefore reliability of the groundwater model for predictions.


2.6.2	Adequate Calibration Data Lacking

The main focus of the DEIS is to estimate potential changes to the surface/subsurface hydrologic system, or GDEs affected by mine drawdown and changes to surface flows. Despite this objective, virtually no observation data for either surface water, or groundwater is available at, or near GDEs to constrain calibration in these critical areas. This is a major flaw in the overall model calibration approach and should have been addressed in the DEIS.

Other major mine modeling efforts (i.e., Rosemont mine24) attempt to reproduce spatial distribution and magnitudes of observed baseflow, but the spatial distribution and long-term (i.e., multiple years) of surface water flow (or stage) data appears inadequate to assess even flow along the entire extent of the three main drainages potentially affected by the mine dewatering/TSF (Queen Creek, Mineral Creek and Devils Canyon).

2.6.3	Pre-mining Conditions, and period from 1910 to 1996 Uncalibrated.The approach to determining pre-mining initial 3-dimensional heads (1910) for 39 model layers was never presented in the WSP, 2019 modeling report, but the DEIS really should have required detailed description of these conditions and how they were derived, and associated errors. They are critical to assessing the nature of long-term post-closure groundwater recovery, rather than attempting to assess recovery relative to the start of RCM pumping in 2009, which already induces a substantial drawdown response, superimposed on the partially-recovered heads from 1910 to 1996 pumping. This is essential information in conservatively assessing mine impacts on GDEs.

From 1910 to 1996, the model appears uncalibrated (no reporting on this in DEIS, or WSP, 2019 report) even the historical pumping locations are largely unknown25, which likely introduces substantial error into the calibration, and further uncertainty in predictions, as the heads by start of RCM pumping in 2009 were no where near recovered to pre-mining conditions.
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","
Page 30, paragraph 7 in WSP, 2019 states “The strong drawdown responses shown in the Deep Groundwater System in response to dewatering of Shafts 9 and 10, is clearly seen in some of the wells inside Resolution graben, specifically DHRES-01_WL, DHRES-02_WL and DHRES- 08_231. These wells were prioritized as key targets to match, as pumping of Shafts 9 and 10 essentially represents a large-scale aquifer test. The fit of these three targets is good and gives an indication of how the model will respond to a large stress on the system, such as the development of the RC mine.” It is clear from this statement that the focus of the WSP, 2019 model calibration was aimed more at quantifying key inputs useful to the design/operation of the mine (i.e., mine inflow, time to drawdown mine etc) rather than focusing on calibration that would minimize errors at what should have been key priority targets, the GDEs.

Much of the DEIS assessment of mine impacts on the surrounding environment is devoted towards assessing how mine dewatering causes groundwater declines at numerous surrounding GDEs, and therefore also changes in surface water discharge. An arbitrary 10-foot decline is used to identify those GDEs that would be impacted, because the groundwater modeling group deemed the model to be less ‘precise’ below 10 feet. By not relying on results less than 10 feet drawdown, RCM in effect sets a key calibration target. As such, model calibration should have focused on GDEs. In otherwords, calibration error (or residuals) should have been minimized at all GDEs, and if clearly reported in the DEIS, so that errors in drawdown are well known. This information would then be useful in estimating a range of uncertainty in drawdown predictions at GDEs.
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Review of the seepage modeling26 associated with TSF alternatives (particularly #6) shows this modeling was never calibrated, because it was based on an idealized, conceptual 2-d profile, rather than using actual field-derived hydrogeologic data. It is understood that the authors of this study (at preferred alternative #6) believe conceptual modeling of this complex, but critical mine component is adequate for assessing different alternatives. But numerous assumptions were made about the subsurface and boundary conditions which would affect leakage estimates, including the implicit assumption that groundwater flows beneath the proposed TSF (for all possible future climate conditions and meteorological conditions) would never interact with internal seepage calculations, which are not conservative. The TSF and surrounding hydrogeologic system is a 3-dimensional flow system, where groundwater flows concentration beneath the central surface drainage. No surface water or groundwater data, or hydrogeologic data support the notion groundwater wouldn’t interact with the calculated seepage. If it did, this becomes critically important in subsequent evaluations of water quality impacts both during mining, and post-closure – and comparison of alternatives. Ultimately, estimates of seepage rates during mining and post-closure are not calibrated, and therefore unreliable.


2.6.6	Presentation of Calibration Results Incomplete/Misleading

Model performance and reliability based on model-wide calibration statistics of only head data gives a misleading and unreliable sense the model is adequately calibrated for intended purpose of evaluating impacts at GDEs. For the high degree of hydrogeologic complexity of the subsurface system, including multiple offset faults, perched, shallow and deep aquifer units and historically complex dewatering in the area, the number, locations and depths of calibration targets is inadequate, particularly in key target GDE areas, the main focus of the groundwater modeling evaluation. For example, Table 3.6 in the WSP, 2019 report indicates Residual Mean in the Apache Leap Tuff is -14 ft, indicating on average, the model over-estimates heads in this shallow aquifer. Yet, closer inspection of transient well hydrographs included in Appendix C of WSP, 2019 closer to surface drainages (i.e., DHRES-08, DHRES-10, DHRES-11, DHRES-12, DHRES-17 and DHRES-18) indicates simulated differences more than 100 to more than 600+ feet

Spatial Bias in Calibration. The WSP, 2019 report shows calibration ‘Scatter Plots’ (see Figures
3.9 and 3.10), but never show spatial bias and residuals at specific wells by aquifer unit. This is essential for assessing calibration error (residuals) at specific GDE locations, generally along streams.

Hydraulic Tests. Calibration to 2 aquifer hydraulic tests appear to reproduce drawdowns in several wells, and even anistropic drawdown trend, but the mine dewatering will continue for several decades, and these hydraulic tests have limited value:
•	Tests are far too small a stress on the aquifer to confirm parameterization, assumed boundary conditions for most of the GDEs.
•	These tests already confirm aquifer response in spatially-biased high density of mine wells.
•	These tests don’t confirm influence of all faults included in the model. It would have been far more instructive to conduct tests, monitoring hydraulic response on both sides of important bounding faults (or faults that act as preferential conduits of groundwater flow.

2.7	Predictions Incomplete and Misleading
A number of issues were identified by predictions in the DEIS, or supporting documents. These are described below.

2.7.1	Predicted change from proper Baseline Conditions Biased.

Historical Magma Mine pumping occurred from 1910 to 1998. RCM pumping started in 2009 (WSP, 2019). WSP states (page 4, paragraph 6) “Water levels had recovered to approximately 2,200 ft amsl by the time dewatering was resumed on March 17, 2009”. This clearly indicates the groundwater levels in the vicinity had not fully recovered, and therefore do NOT represent a proper baseline, or pre-mining condition. Pre-mining Furthermore, it is likely streamflows (and springs) in the area that would have been impacted by historical Magma Mine pumping, and which would have recovered had RCM not restarted pumping in 2009, would have increased the number of baseline GDEs in the area (i.e., Devil’s Canyon stream from DC10.9to DC15).

Pre-mining (baseline) heads for the Tal shallow aquifer are presented in WSP 2019, but no discussion of associated interaction of groundwaters with surface waters during this period is presented. The DEIS should have evaluated RCM mine dewatering and post-closure crater subsidence related to this condition, as the Magma mine dewatering would presumably have recovered to near these levels.



"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.7.2	Predicted flow through fractured crater limited because of model instability.
Page 38, paragraph 1 WSP 2019 indicates that hydraulic conductivities within the fractured crater were limited to only 100 ft/day due to instabilities in the model, if assigned higher values. The fracturing likely produces much higher conductivity values than 100 ft/day, which would enhance vertical drainage from the overlying shallow Tal aquifer due to block caving. The DEIS should require detailed assessment of hydraulic response (or recovery for post-closure) to better assess impacts of this important post-closure condition. It is possible the recovery of water levels post- closure would have been much quicker, leading to better estimates of drawdown and GDE impacts (instead of limiting impacts to 148 years after closure, and 10’ drawdown contours).
 
2.7.3	Evaluation of effect of geothermal water on post-closure flows and water quality not conducted.
No evaluation was presented in the DEIS or associated documents to evaluate geothermally influenced circulation within the post-closure fracture zone, which would act to circulate deep warmer waters with shallow, cooler inflow from ALT aquifer waters, driven by density variations (i.e., warmer waters rise, inducing vertical mixing). Geothermal waters were encountered in Shaft 1027, which surprised RCM and consultants. Often, geothermal waters are found in permeable fault zones, or where faults intersect each other28. Because multiple faults are present in the mine area, the DEIS should have required more characterization, conceptualization and use of an appropriate code capable of simulating heat transport and associated effects of density-driven circulation to better estimate long-term post-closure conditions, and water quality impacts. It’s unclear why RCM didn’t consider potential to develop the geothermal water source to offset energy requirements.

2.7.4	Clear disclosure of full hydraulic impacts is missing.
Montgomery & Associates, 201729, Page ES-6, states “However, the Magma Mine workings do extend west of the fault, providing the potential for hydraulic impacts to extend beyond the fault.” A clear description and explanation of the final 3-d mine closure configuration is never presented. It is apparent that WSP failed to account for the change in land surface in their modeling (~800 to 1100 feet). This is a critical oversight in the DEIS, because had a proper future-condition conceptual model been developed showing the 800 to 1000 ft drop in land-surface, it would have required a similar change in the calibrated model. Simulating long-term (steady state to avoid uncertainty associated with the time it takes for system to recover to pre-mining conditions) post- closure conditions would very likely have shown development of a pitlake (see Section 2.7.7). This is a major impact to the system which the DEIS failed to address.

2.7.5	Inappropriate Predictions of Post-Closure Impacts
WSP, 201930 Page 4, Paragraph 4 states “As water level recovery within the block cave is slow, some areas show additional drawdown continuing to propagate outward after 200 years as steady state equilibrium conditions have not yet been re-established.” Prediction of post-closure hydrologic conditions at an arbitrarily chosen 200 years (or 148 years after closure) is very misleading and incorrectly conveys what will really occur at final steady state conditions. The modeling report suggests even at 148 years post-closure, drawdown is still occurring, due to slow/low recharge, though the flawed calibration/non-unique solution produce model results so uncertain SW discharge is not relied on. Clearly the 200 years should not have been arbitrarily used to assess long-term final impact w/uncertain model. This biases estimated drawdown impacts at GDEs towards the low side (not conservatively high as suggested in the WSP study. By comparison, the modeling conducted for the Rosemont DEIS demonstrated Steady State conditions were achieved at streams of interest (at 1000 years out). This continued drawdown by itself should have alerted modeling group to insist on simulating much longer, or steady state post-closure.
"
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.7.6	Use of 10-foot Drawdown Contour Misleading/Biased

At least a simulated long-term 1-foot drawdown contour should have been used in the identification of GDEs. GDEs, or private wells experiencing even a 1’ drawdown could have significant negative impacts. A simulated 1-foot drawdown contour (or lower) was never shown in the DEIS, but probably shows significant effects of model boundary effects, implying the model extent should have been expanded to avoid any influence over internal calculations as is standard modeling practice. Using the 10-foot drawdown contour to define impacts is highly biased, and likely removes many GDEs from further evaluation of impacts/mitigation. The explanation that drawdowns less than 10-feet are imprecise in the DEIS (see page 301) is flawed. Groundwater models are precise, but suffer from accuracy issues. The accuracy at 1-foot drawdown is the same as 10-feet. A predictive uncertainty analysis would effectively provide a means of adding a
+/- around drawdown contours.

2.7.7	Assessment of potential Pitlake development/impacts flawed
Pitlake Development. WSP 2019 states on Page 1, Paragraph 2 that ‘the potential for a pit lake will be assessed’. Yet the modeling study failed to present any further details on the potential for a pitlake to develop, and to then characterize and evaluate impacts of the pitlake on surrounding flows and water quality. Page 376-377 in the DEIS do describe the ‘Potential for Subsidence Lake Development’, explored by the Groundwater Modeling Workgroup, but the DEIS states on page 377 “Ultimately the Forest Service determined that the presence of a subsidence lake was speculative and not reasonably foreseeable, and as such it would therefore be inappropriate to analyze in the EIS” Table 3.7.2-7 provides an overview of predicted water levels after 1000 years and the DEIS concludes “groundwater levels are still at least 200 feet below the bottom of the subsidence crater”. However, there are two key reasons why it is likely a pit lake would form post- closure:

•	The flow model is highly uncertain, and non-unique due to calibration to only groundwater head data, and not other common calibration datasets (i.e, surface discharge, water quality etc) that would reduce non-uniqueness. As a result, estimated water level recovery at 1000 years is highly uncertain, and levels would likely recover much quicker.
•	More importantly, conceptually, it is easy to argue that the groundwater levels will eventually recover to pre-mining levels (steady state), and at least to currently monitored levels, known to be influenced by Shaft 9/10 pumping since 2009. In fact,
 
these recovered levels, at wells DHRES-01 and DHRES-02 within the crater, exceed 3650 ft, MSL for various screened zones (see observed levels in WSP 2019 report, Appendix C for different well screen zones). According to DEIS Figure 3.7.2-4, these recovered levels would be more than 650 feet above the 1100 ft subsidence crater land surface, and more than 350 feet above the 800 ft landsurface elevations (3000 ft, and 3300 ft, respectively).
•	WSP, 2019 failed to include the change in the ground surface due to the crater in the future condition groundwater modeling. Conservatively, they should have dropped the surface 1100 ft, and let the groundwater model simulate eventual development of the subsidence crater, which would, like the Rosemont mine DEIS modeling that also showed long-term development of a pitlake, change the long-term, or eventual groundwater flow regime. More importantly, with continued evaporation, the pitlake waters would likely also significantly change predicted long-term water quality predictions and risks in the area of this pitlake.
•	Figure 1 from Meza-Cuadra, 2018b31 was revised to reflect conceptually what the WSP, 2019 groundwater model should have simulated (change in land surface), and the eventual development of a pitlake as groundwater levels recover. WSP should have included this type of Future Processes Conceptual Model, which is industry standard (see Potential Errors in Conceptual Modeling, Section 4.6 in Wels, 20121). Rosemont DEIS groundwater modeling of the development of a pitlake was developed using Modflow-Surfact coupled to a dynamic systems model using the GoldSim code. "
"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","2.7.8	Predictive Uncertainty Evaluation Missing

The Groundwater Modeling WorkGroup appeared to acknowledge uncertainty in their modeling predictions of drawdown extent, but then failed to provide a range of predictions for all predictions. Other modeling efforts also appear to have failed to consider any type of predictive uncertainty, despite substantial calibration errors and high input uncertainty. The DEIS should have required a comprehensive approach to dealing with any modeling uncertainty in all model predictions. All of the models developed and referenced in this DEIS (and supporting documents) have numerous assumptions and inputs, each of which translate into prediction uncertainty, but none address the substantial uncertainty in predictions, let alone even identifying and tracking all sources of uncertainty.
Impacts of the proposed Desert Wellfield pumping wells near the proposed MARRCO corridor were evaluated by Bates et al, 201833, using ADWR’s 2009 Salt River Valley (SRV) model34. The ADWR SRV modeling effort never included a predictive uncertainty evaluation, nor did the predictive modeling by Bates et al, 2018. This would have been well warranted in the proposed pumping area, as data used to support model construction are clearly absent in this area. As a result, predictions using this model, in this area are expected to be exhibit high uncertainty, relative to other areas in their model domain, which had much greater data to justify model construction.
Evaluation of hydrologic model prediction uncertainty is critical, yet modelers confused sensitivity evaluation for standard/formal predictive uncertainty analysis. It is important to note that the non- uniqueness of the groundwater flow model calibration (remembering that it was only calibrated to heads, and not discharge, water quality etc) leads to many equally valid predictive solutions. Assessment of the range of possible impacts of the mine on surrounding hydrology (and WQ) is therefore, inadequate and unreliable. It is misleading/incorrect to assume flawed/unreliable model simulated drawdowns above 10 feet are accurate, and those below are inaccurate. GDEs are very sensitive to groundwater levels – and even a 1-foot change likely significantly changes spring/river discharge or even presence. Gabora et al, 201435 appropriately used a Monte Carlo method to predict an entire range of simulated pit model inflows, while maintaining calibration.

The reliability of the model findings is implicitly tied to the accuracy of the model, which by default is uncertain, like all models. Model accuracy can be improved by collecting more data, increasing discretization and better reproducing observations, but in reality this is impossible to achieve, given that models are simplifications of flow systems, and data will always be limited. As such, 
it is far more important for RCM consultants to acknowledge uncertain model predictions, and instead conduct a detailed and robust predictive uncertainty analysis which focuses not just on predicted groundwater inflow to the pit lake, but also on predicted response at all other mine components, at the same time. A sensitivity analysis (ASTM D561136) doesn’t provide a range of possible predicted responses given ranges of uncertain model inputs like an uncertainty analysis, which constrains realizations to maintain calibration within acceptable targets (Doherty, 2010).

Modelers appear to have confused a predictive sensitivity analysis with a predictive uncertainty analysis. The distinction is very important, as a sensitivity analysis does not provide a true assessment of model uncertainty (see Neuman and Weiranga, 20035, Doherty et al, 201038) – typically perturbations cause the model to fall out of calibration, which make the results unreliable. Yet the authors report a range of output from simulations using arbitrary adjustment of selective (i.e., cherry picked) parameters, to imply they’ve considered the full range of possible impacts at GDEs, despite the modelers using the PEST code (described by code author Doherty, 2010) to help refine model calibration (see page 27, WSP, 2019), they failed to use the same code to conduct a predictive uncertainty analysis.

The failure of this DEIS to require formal uncertainty analyses for all of the modeling predicting impacts to the surrounding environment/GDEs is a major oversight. As Doherty et al, 2010 states “Central to any decision-making process is an assessment of risk. Such an assessment is impossible without some assessment of predictive uncertainty.”, which clearly supports the need for some type of uncertainty analysis to qualify predictions.

Ultimately, model predictions of impacts on GDEs are considered highly uncertain, due to a combination of the high level of input uncertainty, high conceptual model uncertainty, uncertainty in calibration data, and notable model error. While it appears that the the groundwater modeling workgroup has acknowledged results are uncertain, especially with distance from the mine operations, further evaluation of uncertainty was dismissed in favour of selective sensitivity evaluations (Meza-Cuadra et al, 2018c37). Conducting a simplified sensitivity evaluation and then claiming it represents model uncertainty is misleading and understates the value of conducting a formal uncertainty analysis (at GDEs). An uncertainty analysis defines a range of equally valid predictions, which maintain calibration constraints, by adjusting individual/combinations of model inputs, to which the solution is most sensitive. Sensitivity analysis identify parameters that predictions are most sensitive to, but do not bracket a realistic range of equally possible solutions that meet objective function constraints (i.e., minimizing the difference between historical and simulated heads), and as such shouldn’t be used in lieu of a constrained uncertainty analysis. Conducting a formal uncertainty analysis and providing a qualified range of potential impacts, provides a much better way to inform critical decisions related to mine permitting.
The null space Monte Carlo Constrained Maximization/Minimization method (Doherty et al, 201038) can provide the very important result of conveying the range (maximum – minimum) of equally plausible predictions of impacts at GDEs. The current sensitivity analysis is a) too selective and doesn’t consider combinations of sensitive parameters and b) isn’t constrained to minimize objective function (i.e., reproducing historical conditions within some value).

The well-known parameter estimation code PEST can be used in conjunction with existing calibrated groundwater models to determine a full range of uncertainty in predicted effects on GDEs using the Null-Space Monte Carlo method (see Doherty et al, 2010). The choice of the target or threshold objective function level at which the model is deemed to be “calibrated” is often subjective (Though targets should be determined based on required accuracy in GDE areas of interest following, for example a baseline study of this flow system that defines minimum environmental flows or changes to the hydrologic/ecologic system, to avoid irreverisble damage).

Doherty et al, 2010 states “The principle that underlies this methodology is illustrated in his figure 6 for a two- parameter system. In this figure, the shaded contour depicts a region of optimized parameters that correspond to the minimum of the objective function. The solid lines depict objective function contours; the value of each contour defines the objective function for which parameters become unlikely at a certain confidence level. Each
contour thus defines the constraint to which parameters are subject as a prediction of interest is maximized or minimized in order to define its post-calibration variability at the same level of confidence. The dashed contour lines depict the dependence of a prediction on the two parameters. The constrained maximization/minimization process through which the post- calibration uncertainty of this prediction is explored attempts to find the two points marked by circles on the constraining objective function contour. These points define parameter sets for which the prediction of interest is as high or as low as it can be, while maintaining respect for the constraints imposed by the calibration process.”

Kliche, P.E., PhD, in November, 2017. The Kliche report identifies a number of significant facts about the proposed mine, including:
•	An indicated plus inferred resource of 1.969 billion short tons containing 1.54 percent copper and
0.035 percent molybdenum at depths 5,000 to 7,000 ft below the surface, with 1.538 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.99% copper.
•	Approximately 2.02 billion tonnes of ore reserves grading 0.86% copper lying at about 350 metres below the existing undercut level of the mine.
•	A loss of 12 to 15% of the ore due to the block caving method.

It too might provide more information on Resolution Copper’s predicted production costs, but it is evidently not available for public review.

"ALT02","Alternatives Considered but Dismissed","ALT","Alternatives","Mining Cost and Production Capacity
SWCA has used Dundee Capital Markets, 2012, An Introduction to Underground Mining to bracket underground mining cost estimates (DEIS 2019). SWCA also estimated that all of the underground mining methods evaluated, except block caving, could accommodate backfilling which could prevent subsidence. All the underground mining methods costs, with the exception of cut-and-fill mining, were the same cost to approximately twice the cost of block caving (SWCA 2017). This cost range is not unreasonable to evaluate further as viable alternatives, given the uses and resources that could be saved by eliminating subsidence.
Production volume for dry tailings for underground backfill was also a consideration, and was used as a discriminating factor for mining method evaluation in the DEIS alternatives screening. It was noted that “The process of using dry stack tailings methods has not been done at the scale of the proposed GPO production scale (130,000 tons per day). The industry maximum of successful dry stack production is 20,000 tons per day.” (DEIS 2019).
However, it should also be noted that the US Forest Service recently approved dry stack tailings at the Rosemont Mine at a production rate of 75,000 tons per day. Since only approximately half of the tailings are typically backfilled in an underground mine, the dry tailings production rate approved at Rosemont would be virtually identical to the rate needed for backfill at Resolution. Dry tailings/backfill production rate should not be a barrier to underground mining at Resolution.

"3.2.01","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Surface Subsidence","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","It should be noted that if the subsidence angle turns out to be less than the 70 to 78 degrees predicted, especially after mining ceases, the fracture zone shown in Figure 16 (DEIS 2019) would move closer to Apache Leap. Any mining of a deeper resource, if done by block caving, the only method considered by Resolution Copper, the fracture zone would likely also widen. As a result, a significant part of the deeper resource would need to be sterilized to protect Apache Leap. With underground backfill this significant part of the resource could be mined.
Underground mining with backfill was inappropriately eliminated from consideration as an alternative because the impacts that could be avoided were not given proper consideration. In addition, the Forest Service expert undervalued the orebody, and dry tailings for backfill is technically feasible as the Forest Service approval of Rosemont clearly demonstrates.
"
"3.2.01","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Surface Subsidence","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","Values Lost Due to Subsidence (DEIS 2019)
The environmental and social values lost due to subsidence are listed in the DEIS. These include:
“The subsidence area (approximately 1,560 acres of NFS lands, prior to the land exchange) would be lost for public access in perpetuity. Based on current knowledge, the steep and unstable slopes of the subsidence area are projected to be unsafe for future public access.”
Tribal Values and Concerns
“Development of the Resolution Copper Mine would directly and permanently damage the NRHP-listed Chí’chil Biłdagoteel Historic District TCP. Other large-scale mine development along with smaller transportation, utility, and private land development projects in the greater Superior region may also affect places and resources of value to Native Americans, including historical and ceremonial sites and culturally valued landforms and features.
Dewatering or direct disturbance would impact between 14 and 16 groundwater dependent ecosystems, mostly sacred springs. While mitigation would replace water, impacts would remain to the natural setting of these places.
Burials are likely to be impacted; the numbers and locations of burials would not be known until such sites are detected as a result of mine-related activities.
Under this or any action alternative, one or more Emory oak groves at Oak Flat, used by tribal members for acorn collecting, would likely be lost. Other unspecified mineral- and/or plant-collecting locations would also likely be affected; historically, medicinal and other plants are frequently gathered near springs and seeps, so drawdown of water at these locations may also adversely affect plant availability.”
Area of Watershed Lost
Queens Creek	1.76 square miles Devils Canyon	0.94 square miles
Water Resources: Groundwater Quantity and Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystems
“When block-caving occurs, groundwater impacts expand to overlying aquifers and two more groundwater-dependent ecosystems (springs) are anticipated to be impacted.	Groundwater supplies in
Superior and Top-of-the-World could be impacted by groundwater drawdown but would be replaced through mitigation.”
“After closure, the reflooded block-cave zone is anticipated to have poor water quality (above Arizona water standards).”
Water Resources: Surface Water Quantity
“There would be a reduction in average annual runoff due to the subsidence crater capturing precipitation, amounting to 3.5% at the mouth of Devil’s Canyon, and 3.5% in Queen Creek at Whitlow Ranch Dam.”
Queen Creek and Tributaries
Queen Creek above Superior: “Reduction in surface runoff volume due to subsidence is estimated to be 18.6% at Magma Avenue Bridge (see Section 3.7.3, Surface Water Quantity). Reduction in runoff volume could reduce amount of water temporarily stored in shallow alluvium or fracture networks. Impacts above Superior could include a reduction or loss of spring/stream flow, increased mortality or reduction in extent or health of riparian vegetation, and reduction in the quality or quantity of aquatic habitat from loss of flowing water, adjacent vegetation, or standing pools.”
 


Queen Creek below Superior: “Reduction in surface runoff volume due to subsidence is estimated to range from 13.4% reduction at Boyce Thompson Arboretum to 3.5% reduction at Whitlow Ranch Dam. Channel largely ephemeral and habitat is generally xeroriparian in nature, accustomed to ephemeral, periodic flows. Impacts on this type of vegetation would be unlikely due to surface flow reductions of this magnitude.”
Devil’s Canyon
“Reduction in surface runoff volume due to subsidence ranges from 5.6% reduction at DC8.1C to 3.5% reduction at confluence with Mineral Creek (see Section 3.7.3, Surface Water Quantity). During critical dry season (May/June), percent reductions are approximately the same. Flow reductions could contribute to a reduction in the extent and health of riparian vegetation and aquatic habitat.”
Rancho Rio Canyon
“A portion of the Rancho Rio Canyon watershed is within the subsidence area, and a reduction in surface water volume is anticipated.”
Springs in the Queen Creek Basin
“Under the proposed action, drawdown continues to propagate well beyond 200 years. The modeled groundwater level trends generally suggest maximum drawdown does not occur until 600 to 800 years after the end of mining at the distant spring locations (Morey 2018c).”
Longer Term Modeled Impacts – Water Supplies
“The predicted groundwater trends suggest that the impacts shown ... for Top-of-the-World are likely the maximum impacts expected (Morey 2018c). However, the groundwater trends for wells in Superior ... suggest that maximum drawdown would not occur until roughly 600 years after the end of mining.
Impacts on groundwater supplies relying on the regional deep groundwater system near Superior may continue to worsen beyond the results report(ed) ...”
Recreation
“All public access would be eliminated on 4,933 acres. Rock climbing opportunities at Euro Dog Valley, Oak Flat, and other portions of the mine area would be lost under all action alternatives but would be partially mitigated by new climbing area(s) set aside by Resolution Copper.”
“The land exchange would have significant effects on recreation. The Oak Flat Federal Parcel would leave Forest Service jurisdiction, and with it myriad recreational opportunities currently available and used by the public. The Oak Flat bouldering area offers freestanding bounders and small cliff-lined canyons with over 1,000 documented boulder routes and problems. The area has held various bouldering and climbing competitions as recently as 2016 and the Phoenix Bouldering Contests and Phoenix Boulder Blasts through 2004; all climbing and bouldering areas would be lost when the Oak Flat Federal Parcel transfers out of Federal ownership. Additional recreational activities that would be lost include camping at the Oak Flat Campground, picnicking, and nature viewing. The campground currently provides approximately 20 campsites and a large stand of native oak trees. It also is boasted as an important birding destination with approximately 183 different species reported by birders.”
Summary
This is an impressive list of predicted impacts, yet the DEIS treats these predictions as a fait accompli. These are, however, preventable losses. For the operators of a large, rich, ore body to take into account a multitude of significant environmental and social resource losses that can be prevented by conducting responsible mining instead of maximizing economic profit, which will have little long-term benefit in the area of the mine, is not too much for a responsible land manager, like the US Forest Service, to require.

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","Tailings Facility – Embankment Type
The Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option, would require a centerline sand dam for the NPAG tailings, and downstream sand dam construction for PAG tailings. The NPAG embankment would contain an underdrain system comprising sand and gravel blanket and finger drains (primarily along main drainages, with some extended beneath the NPAG beach) to maintain a low saturated surface in the tailings embankment and to intercept and direct seepage from the impoundment. The PAG cells would be behind (upstream) and ultimately covered by the NPAG tailings.
Construction Type

This is a significantly safer approach to tailings disposal than the upstream dam with mixed NPAG and PAG tailings proposed by Resolution Copper. Centerline/downstream-type construction is much safer in terms of both potential static and seismic failures than upstream construction.
Wet versus Dry Closure
Dry closure is considered safer than wet closure, because with a wet closure where containment is lost the tailings usually flush from the breach and travel downgradient with considerable force and for a great distance. In the case of wet PAG tailings, if containment is lost then oxidation of this material can be rapid and widespread. The closure scheme proposed for Alternative 6 – Skunk Camp would have a drain system under the NPAG tailings that could be utilized to keep these tailings largely unsaturated.
Although the ideal dry closure would be with dry tailings, drained tailings is the next best choice.
And, although the two PAG impoundments would be wet, they are also totally contained behind and buried by the NPAG tailings. This provides an additional physical barrier to release in the event of a structural failure.
Breach Analysis
A breach analysis shows how far tailings could be released under several scenarios, including normal operating conditions, and during/after a severe storm event. A breach analysis for the Resolution alternatives has yet to be completed.
A breach analysis could/should have been done for the Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp)
– North Option. This is not a difficult analysis. Seismic Risk
Use of the 1:10,000 year return period earthquake as the design earthquake for the tailings dams, as is done for the Preferred Alternative, is the appropriate choice for the design event. Too many agencies use a lesser earthquake as the design event for a structure that is meant to function in perpetuity, so it is good to see the US Forest Service require the appropriate design earthquake.
The seismic analysis for the EIS is largely based on a report by Wong et. al (2013). The Wong et. al (2013) report was focused on analyzing four specific sites that were under consideration at that time: the Far West Tailings Management Area: Far West 1 and Far West 2; the Near West Tailings Management Area; and, the Pinto Valley Operations (PVO) Tailings Management Area. The Proposed Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) was not analyzed in this report.
The Preferred Alternative, Alternative 6 (Skunk Camp) – North Option, would occupy the upper portion of Dripping Spring Valley, the northeastern slopes and foothills of the Dripping Spring Mountains, and the southwestern foothills of the Pinal Mountains, including a 4-mile reach of Dripping Spring Wash, a 3.5-mile reach of Stone Cabin Wash, and a 4.8-mile reach of Skunk Camp Wash.
Cornwall, Banks, and Phillips (1971), map an extensive fault structure running the length of Dripping Spring Wash. This fault is not mentioned in the Wong et al (2013) report or the DEIS (2019). This fault most probably bisects the dams and impoundments, so should merit further investigation and discussion in the DEIS.
The DEIS does not specify the location of the 1:10,000 year event, or the assumed magnitude of this event. In the Wong et al report (2013) it is noted that the values calculated for the PGA are ""significantly lower"" than the values from the USGS Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA) and (USGS 2008). The USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps are typically used to develop the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analyses (PSHA) for a mine location. The US Forest Service should require the use of the most conservative estimates for seismic events because of the extremely long time period for which tailings facilities are planned to function.
In addition, the USGS has updated its National Seismic Hazard Maps (2014) since the Wong et. al. report (2013) was written. At a minimum the seismic study needs to be updated to reflect current information, and to include an analysis of the Preferred Alternative site, which was not included in the 2013 report.
The EIS must use up to date information, make conservative assumptions about the size and location of the maximum credible earthquake, and must disclose the location and magnitude of the maximum credible earthquake used for the design earthquake for the tailings dam.

NEPA Section 102 (C) requires all agencies of the Federal Government to include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on:
(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action …
For the purpose of this discussion focus on the words “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment”. Although NEPA does not define “the human environment” it is clear that it is more than, but includes, the natural environment. NEPA directly addresses economic considerations a number of times, so it can be argued that economic considerations, which are clearly addressed in most EISs in the context of jobs, taxes, and community impacts. If a financial surety is required by law, which is required in Arizona, the EIS should also consider the potential economic impacts on the mining company of obtaining a financial surety for closure and/or a catastrophic failure, as well as the potential impacts to the public should the financial surety be absent, or inadequate.
A financial surety for mine closure, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance, today typically runs in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. If perpetual water treatment is required, then the financial surety required typically doubles. If a company goes bankrupt during or after mining, the financial surety must be adequate to close the mine and perform post-closure monitoring and maintenance. If the financial surety is not adequate, then the public must either provide this money, or suffer the environmental damage associated with leaving the mine in its then-existing state.
It is not atypical that hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake with a closure financial surety. This is clearly a potential impact on the economic and/or natural human environment, and should be disclosed/evaluated in a project EIS, as National Environmental Policy Act (42 USC § 4332) dictates.
However, in the DEIS (2019) it is stated:
“The cost estimates for the reclamation financial assurances are based on the final design of the facility, would be developed after the NEPA process, and would not be finalized until the final GPO is approved.”
This is a failure to analyze a very significant potential impact to the public. In addition, it also means the public will have limited, or no, opportunity to comment on the size or adequacy of the financial surety.

"3.13.07","Socioeconomics: Economic Modeling and Assumptions","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","2.	The Importance of the Visitor Economy in Arizona and the RCM Area

The DEIS and studies it cites make the following statements about the socioeconomic importance of the “Travel and Tourism” industries in Pinal County where the RCM would be located and adjacent areas:

•	In 2016 visitor spending in Pinal County was about $572 million.
•	This visitor spending supported about 6,800 jobs in Pinal County.
•	Approximately 2.6 million people visited the Tonto National Forest to participate in recreational activity.
•	The average visiting group (2.6 people per group) spent $115 per day. This implies total
annual Tonto National Forest recreation visitor spending of $434 million.
•	The Tonto National Forest is one of the most heavily used National Forests for motorized recreation. Statewide, off-highway vehicle user spending adds $1.6 billion in value to the state’s economy and sustains about 21,000 jobs.
•	OHV recreation in Pinal County was the source of $288 million in expenditures and $258
million in Gila County. Maricopa saw $3.2 billion in OHV-related spending. The jobs
 
related to OHV recreation were 1,100 in Pinal, 1,300 in Gila, and 13,100 in Maricopa Counties.
•	In Pinal County, wildlife viewing contributes approximately $89.5 million annually to the
county’s economy.

Statewide, the travel economy is also very important. In 2016 the total economic value created in the travel industry was over $9 billion. In contrast, mining was the source of about
$3.3 billion in value while agriculture and food processing combined were the source of $4 billion. Only micro-electronics manufacturing came close to the travel industry in terms of economic value produced. It was just over $8 billion in 2016.

For comparison purposes, mining in the four-county study area used by the DEIS, Maricopa, Pinal, Gila, and Graham Counties, in 2015 there were about 11,000 people employed in the mining industry, but the total number of jobs in that four-county area was about 2.5 million.
Mining jobs represented about one-half of one percent of the jobs in the four-county study area. BBC Research & Consulting working with RCM data estimated that the proposed project would directly employ 1,523 workers. For comparison, the direct employment associated with travel industry employment for those four study area counties in 2016 was about 112,000, ten times the direct employment associated with the mining industry in the RCM socioeconomic study area.
3.	Environmental Impacts Associated with the Construction and Operation of RCM

The RCM will significantly modify the landscape it will use for its ore production, ore processing, and waste disposal. Huge amounts of rock must be moved and processed and disposed of to produce small amounts of copper. (About 65 pounds of ore will contain one pound of copper). To access the ore, the groundwater must be continuously pumped to keep the mine from flooding. That pumped water will only provide a small percentage of the water needed for the moving and processing of the ore and the waste material (tailings). RCM plans to tap into regional groundwater to provide the large quantity of make-up water it will need to operate the mine. The groundwater pumping will dewater current seeps, springs, wetlands, etc. It will also lead to subsidence of the surface above the ground water. The method that RCM plans to use to gain access to and remove the ore, panel caving, will cause massive subsidence of the surface lands above the ore body, leading to the creation of a very large crater on the surface. That crater area includes parts of the Oak Flats area long used by the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other tribes for cultural and religious purposes. Oak Flats also has a campground, a nationally recognized rock climbing area, and lands used for dispersed camping, wildlife viewing, and  OHV recreation. The geological instability due to the subsidence above the mined-out ore body may also threaten a dominant feature of the landscape, Apache Leap, which has cultural and religious significance to the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other Native American peoples.

The tailings storage facilities as originally proposed by RCM (Proposed Alternative, Alternative 2) required for storage of the waste associated with the concentration of the ore would have create very large structures that would have covered 3,300 acres with embankments 520 feet high and 10 miles long. According to the DEIS, the U.S. Forest Service’s Preferred Alternative, (Alternative 6, the Skunk Camp location)) was designed to reduce the impacts on scenic resources and recreational opportunities. However, in the DEIS socioeconomic section, it finds that the preferred options, Alternative 6—Skunk Camp “would have the largest negative effect on tourism and recreation of any of the proposed alternative.” (DEIS p. 655) It moves the tailings storage facility farther from established towns and population centers. It still would be quite high, 490 feet, and cover 4,000 acres (DEIS p. ES-20). Such tailing storage facilities carry the risk of catastrophic failure, wide scale environmental damage, and loss of life. They also carry the risk of acid mine drainage polluting surface and groundwater in perpetuity. The concentration plant, a large industrial facility, will be located adjacent to the City of Superior.
The Arizona National Scenic Trial passes through areas that have surface mining facilities.
About 5.5 miles would be impacted under some of the alternatives while pipelines will cross the trail in other alternatives.

The DEIS in its conclusions to the Socioeconomic section (3.13) states that:

“Loss of jobs in the local tourism and outdoor recreation industries cannot be avoided or fully mitigated. Likewise, loss in property values for property close to the mine would constitute an impact that cannot be avoided or fully mitigated.”

“Socioeconomic impacts are both positive and negative and are primarily short term. The project would provide increased jobs and tax revenue from construction through final reclamation and closure. However, this would be offset by potential impacts on local tourism and outdoor recreation economies, and a decrease in
nearby property values; as these effects are largely the result of the tailings  storage facility, which is a permanent addition to the landscape, they could persist over the long term.”
…………………………

“Some changes in the nature of the surrounding natural setting and landscape would be permanent, including the tailings storage facility and the subsidence area. The action alternatives would therefore potentially cause irreversible impacts on the affected area with regard to changes in the local landscape, community values, and quality of life.”

Note that the increased jobs and tax revenue associated with the RCM are described as known and certain: RCM “would have” or “would provide” jobs and payroll and tax revenues while the negative impacts on local tourism and outdoor recreation economies are just “potentials” that might be realized. The DEIS socioeconomic analysis repeatedly treats the positive impacts of the proposed mine as known and certain while the economic impacts of these major changes in the physical environment in the area due to the proposed mine are described as uncertain or unknowable.

As indicated by the summary statements quoted above, the DEIS does recognize that the construction and operation of the RCM will damage the natural landscapes on which the recreational economy depends and, for that reason, will have negative impacts on an important part of the local and regional economy. The DEIS, however, does not quantify those negative RCM impacts in the same way it quantifies the positive RCM socioeconomic impacts. As a result, the RCM’s negative socioeconomic impacts, the “costs,” are understated and the positive impacts, the “benefits,” are overstated. The result is an unbalanced analysis that is misleading to both the public and federal land managers and decision makers. One thing which all parties can agree is “known and certain” is that the negative impacts of the construction and operation of the mine project will permanently and irreversibly degrade the natural landscape.

"3.13.05","Socioeconomics: Travel and Tourism","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","4.	Shrinking the Size of the Negative Impacts of the RCM on Both the Recreation Economy and Amenity Supported Local Economic Vitality

The DEIS provides a brief statement of the RCM’s “potential effects on the nature-based tourism economy.” The DEIS defines that nature-based tourism economy broadly. It “includes the economic activity of…users of the area’s natural amenities for tourism and recreation.
Nature-based tourists may participate in one or more activities, including OHV use, camping, hiking, rock climbing, hunting, fishing, and picnicking.” “Nature-based tourism is the primary tourism activity” in Pinal and Gila Counties. The DEIS, however, does not quantify the negative impacts of RCM on this nature-based tourism because, it says, there is a lack of visitation data.
The cooperating agency, The Arizona Game & Fish Department also indicates that lack of data  on recreational uses of the land makes quantifying impacts difficult: “The Department does not collect data on wildlife watching across game management units; therefore we cannot provide an estimated value. We note that wildlife watching destinations occur in the [management] units and that many people are combining recreational experiences, such as OHV or camping with wildlife watching.” The Arizona Game & Fish Department does have expertise and detailed location data for the consumptive part of wildlife-related recreation, namely hunting, and uses that information to estimate the reduction in hunting that would take place if the RCM was constructed and operated over its planned life.

Given that much of this nature-based tourism takes place on the Tonto National Forest where the U.S. Forest Service is the land manager and the lead agency preparing this DEIS, this is not a very convincing explanation of the failure to quantify the negative impacts of the RCM. If  anyone would be expected to collect such data on the use of these public lands, it would be the Tonto National Forest, the management agency. It is inappropriate for the land manager to plead that it does not know how its land is being used and, therefore, it cannot provide sufficient information about what recreational uses will be degraded or lost if the proposed RCM proceeds to construction and operation.

The DEIS conclusion about the impact of RCM on the nature-based tourism economy is very vague: “If the proposed mine causes visitation and spending patterns to shift, it may result in lower tourism spending receipts for local businesses, which in turn could reduce tourism- related earnings and employment in the analysis area.” (emphasis added)
 
In contrast, the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s summary of the RCM’s “anticipated impacts to species of economic importance, wildlife related recreation and public access” phrased those impacts in much more direct way although it too concluded that certain degrading impacts “could” impact the net economic benefits of the mine:

“The construction of the proposed RCM project is anticipated to have direct and indirect impacts on wildlife habitat, recreation and public access. These impacts are anticipated to reduce wildlife-related recreation (hunters and watchable wildlife), OHV recreation, and access to other outdoor opportunities such as hiking, biking, horseback riding, camping, and recreational shooting within the area of the proposed mine plan of development. Anticipated changes in outdoor and wildlife related recreation could reduce direct economic benefits to the local community, county and state.”

Note the focus on the full range of outdoor recreation opportunities in the vicinity of the RCM. Unfortunately, the impacts of the mine on most of these recreation opportunities is almost entirely ignored. This is not surprising given the incentive structure faced by the Arizona Game  & Fish Department and most other state game and fish departments. Arizona Game & Fish receive a significant part of it funding from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses. This funding arrangement reinforces the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s commitment to managing huntable wildlife and maintaining access to huntable wildlife habitat for licensed hunters. For a DEIS dealing with all of the environmental impacts, this is a serious inadequacy. What the Game & Fish analysis, and therefore the DEIS analysis too, did was dramatically shrink the environmental impacts of concern and importance from recognizing the broad range of recreational activities in the vicinity of the proposed mine to only wildlife-related recreation. It then narrowed the focus of the impact analysis still further by focusing almost exclusively on consumptive wildlife-related recreation which in this area is primarily hunting. Other, non- consumptive, wildlife-related recreation such as observing wildlife was largely ignored.

That is not made clear in the DEIS. Table 3.13.4-4 is labeled to suggest that it is dealing with all wildlife-related recreation expenditures under the alternative tailing disposal sites: “Total projected reduction in direct wildlife-related recreation expenditures under each tailings alternative.” The source of that table was Table 12 in the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s Species of Economic Importance report on the impact of the RCM. That source table was titled: “Summary of a portion of the economic impacts to wildlife related recreation as a result of the proposed RCM project…” (emphasis added)  It makes clear that this table is not reporting the total negative impact of RCM on wildlife-related recreation, although the table title does not specify on what portion of the RCM impact is being reported.

The Arizona Game and Fish Department report that the DEIS relied on makes clear that the negative impact of the RCM on one important part of wildlife-related recreation was not being estimated by the Department:

“The [AGF] Department has no specific measure or process to quantify levels of wildlife watching recreation by GMU [Game Management Unit] or destination and therefore does [not] include estimates of [wildlife watching] economic impacts in estimated value for wildlife related recreation below. Therefore taking into account only a portion of the economic impacts from a decrease or loss of wildlife related recreation in each RCM project area, the anticipated economic impacts would be greater than those presented in Table 12 below.”

That is, the DEIS Table 3.13.4-5 is an understatement of the recreation losses associated with the RCM because wildlife watching recreation is not included. In fact, that table is reporting only on the reduction in the spending by consumptive wildlife-related recreation, which in the area where the RCM facilities would be located, is only hunting. That is important to understand since hunters represent only a small part of all wildlife-related recreation. Wildlife viewing, for instance, involves may more recreationists. Statewide, for instance, there are 1.6 million wildlife watchers but only 270,000 hunters.

What the DEIS took from the Game & Fish Department study of wildlife-related recreation was an estimate of the reduction in hunting and the resulting reduction in total hunter spending including in some instances the hunter revenue associated with hunting permits and licenses. The result of narrowly focusing only on hunters is a relatively small annual negative impact due to  the RCM: $12,500 to $70,600 depending on the tailing alternative. This is multiplied by the sixty-years which is given as the time period the mine is projected to be active. Given that many of the impacts of the RCM will be more or less permanent (e.g. the crater and tailings storage facility) or near permanent (e.g. mine groundwater reduction and recovery, it is unclear that this  is a meaningful calculation. The impacts of the construction and operation of the RCM will not
 
simply go away when active mining ceases.
5.	Quantifying the Reduced Access to Recreational Opportunities

The Arizona Game and Fish study of the impact of the RCM on “species of economic importance” did quantify that impact, but not in dollar terms. Instead it calculated “miles of
public access-motorized routes” and “acres of motorized dispersed camping” lost due to the presence of RCM facilities under the different alternative locations for the tailing storage facilities. The focus was on motorized access including OHV as well as normal automotive access. Given the relative importance of OHV in recreational activities in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, this provided important information. What is not clear is why this lost motorized recreation was not expressed in dollar terms? That was done with hunting using hunter spending levels. There is information on the spending by OHV recreationists broken down by type of expenditure. Yet the quantification provided, as with most of the recreation activity recognized as taking place in the vicinity of the RCM, did not allow comparison with the economic impacts projected for the RCM.

"3.13.04","Socioeconomics: Copper Corridor Community Values","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","1.	Socioeconomic Analysis Does Not Support Substantial Benefits for the Superior Area

One of the most often expressed reasons that has been offered for the need to approve the RCM and the accept the environmental damage associated with it is that the Superior area and the Copper Triangle need the RCM to improve the standard of living, the provision of municipal services, and the quality of life. Careful socioeconomic analysis shows that this is a grossly misguided expectation.

RCM will provide little or no financial improvement in the Superior area and will undermine the quality of life and economic future of the area. Superior will face a serious net loss and any gain will flow quickly to the large urban areas of the state. Although the DEIS provides a socioeconomic analysis that appears to suggest significant positive economic impacts in the Superior area, that analysis does not provide an accurate and balanced look at the socioeconomic impacts associated with the RCM. Careful socioeconomic analysis shows that the people who  live in the Superior area and the Copper Triangle will have to live with the mine while it is in operation and then will be left with a massive crater, a tailings storage facility that will be a risk  to their environment forever, and a heavily industrialized but shut down town. If the local area around the mine is to incur these damages, then it should be shown that the local area will benefit in some substantial way while the mine is in operation. The socioeconomic analysis in the DEIS does not focus on Superior or the Copper Triangle. Instead it focuses on a study area that is dominated by the state’s two largest metropolitan areas, Phoenix and Tucson. In that non-local context, one can demonstrate significant positive financial impacts because the financial benefits from RCM flow primarily away from the Superior area to those large metropolitan areas and the state as a whole.
2.	The Local Analysis Area

The Socioeconomic section of the DEIS begins by laying out the analysis area. The analysis area, as we would expect, is described as the local area around the proposed mine with specific emphasis on the town of Superior which is the closest town to the mine:

“The socioeconomic analysis focused primarily on the region informally known as the “Copper Triangle,” which encompasses the location of the proposed mine, and most closely examined potential effects in the town of Superior, which is the closest community.”

We would expect this definition because this local area will be the most impacted by the proposed mine when it is operating, and the town of Superior will be around long after the mine has shut down. By focusing the socioeconomic analysis on the local area, we can give the people that live and work in the local area an idea of what they might expect if the mine is approved there. Unfortunately, like most “local” analyses that we have seen associated with proposed mines, the DEIS is actually looking at a much larger area in order to inflate the apparent “local” impacts of the proposed mine.

Immediately after stating in the socioeconomic section of the DEIS “most closely examined potential effects in the town of Superior, which is the closest community,” the DEIS then includes the metropolitan cities of Phoenix and Tucson into the “local” analysis area. For
 
reference, and to illustrate why we see this as a fatal flaw in the socioeconomic section, the town of Superior is stated in the DEIS to have 2,999 residents. When Maricopa County, home to the largest city in the state of Arizona (Phoenix), and Pima County, home to the second largest city in Arizona (Tucson), are added into the “local” study area, just those two added counties have a combined population of almost 5.5 million people. The combined population of Maricopa and Pima Counties is more than 1,800 times as large as the town of Superior on which the DEIS said that it would focus, and indeed should have focused.


The problem with this amalgamation of areas is that the inclusion of Phoenix and Tucson in the “local” analysis is that then the town of Superior is completely obscured or effectively hidden by the inclusion of these two massive population centers. In fact, Maricopa was the fastest- growing county in the nation in 2017 adding 74,000 people in 2017 alone. To put this type of growth into the context that we are dealing with, in 2017 Maricopa County added the equivalent of almost 25 towns the size of Superior in just one year.

When impact analysis is done, as it was in this RCM DEIS, economic models like IMPLAN are used to measure the impact of the mine on the economies that surround the mine. The impact analysis looks at the local areas ability to provide the mine with the things that the mine needs to operate. The direct impacts are the pay that the local people receive while working at the mine. The secondary benefits are measured by the local area’s ability to provide the mine with supplies and the mine workers with their needs.

Clearly the town of Superior does not have the same ability to supply the mine and the mine workers with the same amount of secondary materials as the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson can. By including such large and populous metropolitan areas in the local analysis area, the spending of the mine and the mine workers (the secondary impacts) appears quite large. The mine may be able to purchase, for example, heavy equipment and fuel from such large metropolitan centers and the workers can purchase housing, food, clothing, and all of the other things that a miner with relatively high pay might want. The problem is that the town of Superior is so small that it is essentially obscured by the metropolitan areas of Phoenix and Tucson.
For example, when we look at table 3.13.4-1 in the DEIS we can see that Superior will receive about 9 percent of the secondary labor income and about 14 percent of the secondary jobs associated with the proposed mine. Stated in a slightly different manner 91 percent of the secondary labor income will go to areas outside of the town of Superior and 86 percent of secondary jobs will go to workers outside of the town of Superior. While the DEIS excitedly asserts that:

“On average, the mine is projected to directly employ 1,523 workers, pay about $134 million per year in total employee compensation, and purchase about $546 million per year in goods and services (not shown in table 3.13.4-1). The IMPLAN results indicate that the proposed mine would create substantial “multiplier” effects (technically known as indirect and induced economic effects) in Arizona, supporting almost 2,200 indirect and induced jobs and about $135 million per year in indirect and induced labor income. Including direct and multiplier effects, the proposed mine is projected to increase average annual economic value added in Arizona by about $1.0 billion”

After proclaiming the massive benefits projected by the IMPLAN modeling which shows the boon to Arizona and the area outside of Superior, the town of Superior is given this scant mention:

“However, most of the multiplier effects would occur outside of the “Copper Triangle.” While all of the direct mine employment is expected to be based in the ZIP code encompassing Superior, only 11 percent of the multiplier effects are projected to occur within that ZIP code.”

While we believe that even the 11 percent mentioned is an arithmetic mistake, the sentiment is correct. Given that the vast majority of the workers will live outside of Superior and that the mine will get its supplies from the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas as well as from all around  the globe as their IMPLAN modeling shows, we are left in the dark as to what the potential benefits and cost to the local area will be because of the proposed mine.

By including Maricopa and Pima Counties in the socioeconomic modeling, the potential impact of the mine on the town of Superior is lost. While, as the IMPLAN modeling projects, the state of Arizona, Phoenix, and Tucson might very well benefit from a mine in Superior, the benefits and costs to the town of Superior are not revealed at all.
3.	Socioeconomic Impacts
 
The reality of the proposed mine is that the people that will benefit the most from the mine will not be residents of Superior. The primary beneficiaries, most of those employed at the mine and those businesses selling supplies to the mine, will reside elsewhere. Effectively, the wealth that is created at the RCM site in the Superior area will flow to the metropolitan areas that will supply the workers and the materials the mine needs to operate. While the Tonto National  Forest’s DEIS initially says that they are not sure: “Where the employees of the proposed mine would choose to reside”, we can say with some certainty that initially almost none of them would live in Superior and eventually a little less than 10 percent could live in Superior. The problem is that there is not enough housing stock for Superior to accommodate all of the direct employees RCM anticipates for the proposed mine, and, even if there were enough housing in Superior, it is likely that some, possibly most, of the direct employees would choose to live in the Phoenix metro area and not in the largely substandard housing available in Superior.

While Maricopa County had more than 226,000 vacant housing units between 2011 and 2015, there were 319 in Superior. If we assume that all of these homes could be purchased or rented by mine workers, which BBC Research & Consulting (BBC) say is unlikely since they “likely span a fairly wide range in terms of their current condition”, then about 21 percent of the directly employed mine workers could potentially live in Superior. BBC, who did most of the work that went into the socioeconomic section of the DEIS (section 3.13) goes on to say that “Currently, Superior is primarily attracting the mining “transient” population, largely consisting of unmarried skilled trades workers on 3-to-4-year shifts” and that “the limited housing stock and other challenges in attracting new residents are likely to limit the number of mine-related   workers that actually move to Superior.” Finally BBC settles on mine workers being able to “absorb about one-half of the available, non-dilapidated housing stock” implying that “about 150 new households would move to Superior.”

Assuming that BBC is correct, then a little less than 10 percent of the mine workers will live in Superior. That means that greater than 90 percent of the mine workers will live in and come from outside of Superior, which is similar to the secondary jobs and employee compensation in the IMPLAN modeling in the DEIS. This also means that although all of the workers will be using many of the municipal services of Superior, like the roads, the water and sewage lines, the police, and the various different emergency/medical services, they will be taking the money that they get as a mine worker back outside of the local area to spend it. In other words, the town of Superior will not be able to collect tax revenues from the vast majority of those mine workers who will impose substantial burdens on Superior’s existing infrastructure as they commute into and out of Superior each day.

In fact the DEIS specifically states that “The Town of Superior anticipates that its costs of providing services related to public safety (police and fire protection) would increase by about 50 percent if and when the proposed mine becomes fully operational.” The DEIS also indicates that “Construction and operations of the proposed mine could also affect the Town of Superior’s cost to maintain its network of streets and roads, though this impact is more difficult to project.”   Since the DEIS analysts did not do the analysis to look at the potential impacts on roads, they use a scaling function in the DEIS, based on in-commuting employees of the mine spending 8 hours per day “in or adjacent” to Superior to suggest that the general government services that Superior will have to provide to these workers are projected to increase by $540,000 per year in the “near term” and $980,000 in the “long term”. The DEIS then goes on to say that there will be a  shortfall of about $40,000 per year in the “near term” and a surplus of about $100,000 in the  “long term” due to the mine. However, the DEIS’s “long term” fiscal surplus is explicitly dependent on 455 new households moving to Superior even though bv BBC’s own calculation there is housing stock in Superior for, at most, only150 of them. Assumedly the long term cost   on Superior’s municipal services would be far larger than the current surplus (or benefit) that is predicted, since it is predicated on the creation of 305 new residences for people who are   unlikely to choose to live in Superior, and will instead choose to live in the Phoenix area and commute in as RCM’s current workers have already been doing. In other words, without the assumed creation of these homes and the increased tax base that they bring, Superior will sustain  a significant “long-run” fiscal deficit caused by the mine.

The real problem with this slight-of-hand math is that the property values are not going to increase in the Superior area and will instead be dramatically impacted by the proposed mine. In place of having 305 new homes built and the town of Superior getting increased property taxes associated with those new homes, Superior will instead face an increase in demand for city services of about $1 million dollars while seeing a massive decline in property values due to the damages created by the construction and operation of the mine. That is, people will not move to Superior and build houses balancing out the increased cost of services imposed by the proposed mine and its workers. Instead the workers will commute in and out and the very presence of the mine will drive down property values all over town.

This unfortunate reality is shown in the DEIS in table 3.13.4-5. In this table, it is clear that all property that is within a 5-mile radius of the proposed tailings storage facilities will suffer permanent loss of value. For three of the five action alternatives this loss of property value
 
conservatively ranges between a little more than $3 million to a little less than $5.5 million dollars. Remember that the increase in services that Superior will have to pay is supposed to be offset by mine workers living in the area and paying property taxes. Mine workers displacing current residents, or even purchasing and/or renting vacant houses in Superior do not expand the tax base. The only way that more property taxes will be collected is if property values increase (and clearly that is not what is likely to happen) or people build more houses. It seems extremely unlikely that people will choose to locate to a small town where the real estate is losing value because of the presence of a mine, and choose to build a new house as an investment that can
then be taxed by the city and where the value of that home will decline with each “flickering” of employment and payroll associated with the volatile copper industry. It seems far more likely  that people will choose to still live in the Phoenix area and that local residents may choose to leave as their town becomes much more industrialized and their property loses value. Although the DEIS briefly mentions that the copper ore processing and concentrating facilities that will be located in the city could impact the town of Superior, no value is attached to this loss of property value:

“While the proposed mine facilities at the East Plant Site and the West Plant site could have some adverse effects on property values in Superior due to creating a more industrialized setting, those effects would likely be more than offset by the increased demand for housing and commercial space in the town.”

As we have already shown, there will not be an increase in property values in Superior because of the proposed mine, there will be a decrease. What we are pointing out here is that the decrease has been dramatically underrepresented since the impact of a processing facility in the town of Superior has not been quantified with respect to property values. We believe that it is unlikely that an increase in demand for housing and commercial space will take place in a town that has now been more heavily industrialized. That is not why people want to live in Superior. The presence of the mine, and specifically a processing facility in Superior, has the potential to dramatically decrease the property values all over town and not increase them as is stated in the DEIS.

It appears very unlikely that the increased property values and increased housing in Superior, as a result of the proposed mine, will bring an increase in property taxes for the town of Superior. In fact the opposite is likely to be true and has yet to be quantified. What we do know is that   there will be an increase in the services that the town of Superior will have to provide that is currently estimated at almost $1 million per year because of the proposed mine and its ore processing operations, and the disposal of its wastes. The proposed mine is likely to cost the City of Superior dramatically more than the RCM will be providing to the town of Superior in the  form of property taxes and voluntary programs operated by the mining company. Stated in a slightly different manner, the presence of the mine in Superior will increase the taxes that the local residents have to pay in order to offset the increased demand for municipal services.

"3.13.02","Socioeconomics: Tax Revenues / Public Facilities and Services","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","4.	Taxes: Tremendous Wealth That Does Not Flow Back to the Town of Superior

It appears, from the section above, that there is a rather large fiscal gap that must be filled by increased taxes on the residents of Superior. Miners will not flood into Superior to build their dream homes and new companies will not fill the commercial spaces with new businesses.
Instead it is likely that property values will decline across the city because of the proposed mine and its support facilities while more and more municipal services will be required of the city because of the mine and its workers.

One would assume that the town of Superior would simply be able to tap into the massive revenue stream that is predicted to come from the proposed mine in the form of various different taxes. The problem is that most of the taxes that are collected will be distributed back to the  cities and counties of Arizona based on population. As was stated earlier, the Town of Superior has just under 3,000 people while the state of Arizona has about 7 million people in it. This would suggest that about four hundredths of one percent of population-based funding that is paid by the mine will come back to the town of Superior. Given this local tax revenue redistribution mechanism, the town of Superior stands to get very little back in the form of taxes. We now turn to a more detailed look at each of those taxes.

Property Taxes

This is the single largest source of fiscal revenues from the proposed mine. BBC estimates that Resolution will pay about $65 million annually to the Superior Unified School District, however:

“it is important to note that school funding in Arizona is equalized on a per student basis
 
across the state’s school districts based on a foundation system initially established in 1980 (ATRA 2009). If the proposed mine develops and substantially increases the property tax base within the school district, the state’s school finance system would likely lead to either a reduction in the school district’s mill levy, a redistribution of the increase in the school district’s property tax revenues to help fund other districts in Arizona, or a combination of both. It is likely that the actual impact on funding for the Superior Unified School District would be more related to a potential increase in the number of students in the district (due to direct and secondary mine-related workers and
families moving into the district) than to the increase in the property tax base within the district due to the construction of the mine and its processing facilities.”

Since we have already established that there will not be a substantial increase in population in Superior it is very unlikely that there will be an increase in the number of students in the district. It is even more unlikely that a very small potential increase in the number of students would add significantly to school revenues.

Despite the projection that RCM would pay $65 million in property taxes, the Town of Superior “expects to receive about $200,000 per year in property tax revenues from RCM.” The vast majority of that “tax windfall” will be distributed to government entities across the state.
While $200,000 annually is a substantial sum of money, it is the balance of the increased services against the fiscal revenues that are taken in that will be important to keep track of as we go through the potential fiscal impacts. We will total those taxes at the end of this section.

Severance Taxes

The DEIS as stated above points out that the severance tax revenues go to government units across the state based on population. The current levy is “2.5 percent severance tax on 50 percent of the difference between the mine’s annual gross revenues and its annual operating  cost.” Again, as with the property tax, the severance tax is distributed throughout the state of Arizona based on population. While the total amount to be distributed to local governments is estimated to be between $5.9 and $6.9 million per year from the RCM (based again on a copper price of $2.00-$2.50 per pound), Superior would receive a little less than $1 per resident per year or just under $3,000. The “cities located in the “copper triangle” (including Superior) would
receive less than $10,000 per year.” Corporate Income Taxes from RCM
BBC estimated that Resolution would owe $20 million per year in corporate income
taxes. Unfortunately, once again, this tax is distributed throughout the state based on population. Because of this, of the $20 million, “revenue to the Town of Superior would be modest, at about
$10,000 per year. Including Globe and Miami, total corporate income tax distributions to cities within the “copper triangle” would be a little less than $45,000 per year.” Clearly there is something of a pattern in these taxes. Although the state as a whole would appear to be  somewhat better off because of the new fiscal revenues, almost all of the tax revenues from a mine like RCM leave the local area where the mine is located and the long-lived or permanent environmental damage is done and the city has to fund the increased services associated with the workers while the mine is operational.

Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT)

The Transaction Privilege Tax is basically a sales tax that partially is set by local taxing jurisdictions like the City of Superior and partially set by the state government. BBC has estimated that the TPT on sales resulting from the proposed mine would generate about $9.2 million per year in revenues to the state and local governments. The state would get about $6.2 million while local governments would receive the remaining $3 million from the locally levied TPT and its population-based share of state government distribution of its share of the tax revenues. The Town of Superior is projected to receive about $125,000 per year, almost entirely from its 3.3 percent city TPT. Little revenue would come from the state distribution of its share of the TPT.

Employee Income Tax:

Since this tax is redistributed, in part, to all of the cities in Arizona based on population, the Copper Triangle and specifically Superior will again receive very small amounts of revenue from the proposed mine:
 
“…annual Arizona personal income tax collections on the direct and secondary [RCM] workforce are projected to be about $5.4 million. The state would retain 85 percent of this revenue, with the remainder distributed across all of the cities in Arizona. Given their relatively small populations, cities in the “copper triangle” would receive relatively little of this revenue, totaling about $12,000 in aggregate. Superior would likely receive less than $3,000 per year in distributions of employee income taxes.”

The five taxes that are described above are a perfect microcosm for the mine itself as it
relates to the local area. Very large amounts of wealth stand to be created by the proposed mine and almost none of it will remain in the local area.

Property Taxes on RCM Employees Living in Superior

While BBC, which provided the socioeconomic analysis for the DEIS, and the DEIS estimate that the town of Superior will receive as much as $100,000 annually from property tax increases, it is unclear to Power Consulting why this will be the case. While BBC previously had stated that only 150 direct workers would locate to Superior, and would live in houses that already exist, it appears that they have either double counted the property taxes or have increased the property values in the town of Superior. The double counting would be because the houses  are already owned and people in Superior are and were already paying property taxes on them.  As for the property value increase, we would instead postulate that the reverse would in fact be true: That people would leave the local area and that property values would precipitously drop creating a dramatic drop in fiscal revenues for the City of Superior as processing facilities and tailings storage facilities are sited both in town and directly adjacent to town. This would happen as Superior becomes more industrialized with a processing facility in town and a large tailings storage facility looming over town.

While we generally accept the logic in the calculation of the five taxes previously discussed, we do not agree that there will be an increase in property taxes for the town of  Superior because of mine workers moving to the local area and building new houses. If anything, property values will decrease across the city and there will be a decrease in property taxes in place of the increase reported in the DEIS.

A Recap of the Potential Fiscal Impacts for the Town of Superior

The proposed mine, will generate in taxes, “an average of between $88 and $113 million per year.” Of that $88 to $113 million per year, the town of Superior stands to receive $341,000 or between 3 three- and four-tenths of one percent of the taxes that will be created by the proposed mine. We must also remember that these potential “benefits” in the form of taxes must be compared against the increase in services that will be necessary to accommodate the proposed mine and its workers. While the DEIS estimates that the taxes flowing to Superior would increase by $700,000 “if future development accommodates the full housing demand estimate of 455 workers living in Superior,” this too seems highly speculative given the short distance to the Phoenix metro area where the workers will have already been living and commuting for years.

The much more likely result is that there will be an increase in the cost of municipal services, paid for by local residents, because of the large flow of transient mine workers through the town. As stated earlier that totals about $1 million while only $341,000 is collected by the town of Superior because of the proposed mine. In other words, there is a funding gap of at least $659,000 associated with the proposed mine with respect to taxes collected by Superior compared to increased demand for services due to the influx of transient mine workers.. And this is before the decrease in property values, which will have serious fiscal impacts of its own that are not considered by BBC or in the DEIS.

The bottom line is that the people of Superior will see massive wealth created in their town while seeing their property values decrease and being asked to pay increased taxes to cover the increased municipal services associated with the proposed mine and its workforce. In the end, after the mine has shut down after years of construction, operation, and efforts at environmental remediation, Superior will be left with an abandoned industrialized town with decreased property values, looming tailings storage facilities, polluted surface and groundwater and a very large subsidence crater that sits directly adjacent to town.

"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","While the DEIS discusses the likely impacts of RCM mining, processing, and storing waste on groundwater dependent ecosystems associated with various seeps, springs, creeks, etc.
in the  vicinity of the proposed RCM mining complex, it does not discuss the likely socioeconomic impact of RCM obtaining the 600,000 acre-feet of the “fresh” water that the  DEIS assumes RCM will have to obtain in order to operate the mine and concentrators as well as manage the waste (tailings) under the Proposed Action Alternative (Alternative 2). Because of continuing low water flows in the Colorado River Basin, the two major reservoirs in the Lower Basin, Lake Mead and Lake Powell have faced declining water volumes with water levels 50 to 60 percent below full pool. As a result of the declining water levels in Lake Mead, the Bureau of Reclamation, for the first time, declared a water shortage in August 2019 and reduced the   amount of water that Arizona and Nevada are allowed take from the Colorado River in 2020.

Drought conditions have existed in Arizona for at least two decades and continued climate change is expected to bring higher temperatures and lower rainfall and increasing shortages of water with which to support Arizona’s growing population and economy. In this setting of water scarcity, any new large increased demand for water, such as RCM, can be satisfied only by reducing the water available to current and/or other new water users in Arizona. The socioeconomic impacts associated with the uneven allocation of impacts from this competition for water in Arizona that will be exacerbated by RCM’s water demands, is important and needs to be carefully discussed in the DEIS but was not.
1.	The Total Amount of Water the RCM Will Need to Import

The proposed RCM will require large quantities of “fresh” water to be imported into the mining operation. The DEIS estimates that for the Proposed Action, i.e. the alternative representing what RCM has proposed (Alternative 2), approximately 600,000 acre-feet of water will have to be delivered to the mining operations during the 40-year life of the mine. RCM proposes to obtain that water either from the Central Arizona Project (CAP) water, purchase from third party   owners of water or by accessing the groundwater through mineral extraction permits issued by  the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). The exact location of mineral extraction permitted wells (MEPW) include some wells from the Desert Wellfield along the MARRCO corridor in the East Salt River Valley. However, the full panoply of MEPW and their exact locations are not disclosed in the DEIS or any disclosed supporting documents.



An acre-foot of water is approximately the amount of water that three average Phoenix metro households use in a year. The amount of water needed under the DEIS Proposed Action for the life of the mine would provide water for 1.8 million average households in the Phoenix area for a year or 180,000 households for ten years.
2.	The Increasing Water Shortage and Competition for Water in Arizona

RCM would be pursuing this large quantity of water at the same time that Arizona’s water supply is likely to be highly stressed by a long-term drought and annual withdrawals from the Colorado River that exceed the annual inflows available. That has led to declining water levels in Lake Mead, the storage reservoir that provides Colorado River water to Arizona through the Central Arizona Project (CAP). The water level in Lake Mead was more than 60 percent below  its capacity in October 2019. If the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s projected water level for Lake Mead falls below 1,090 feet, as it did in August 2019, a water shortage (“Tier Zero”) is declared by the Bureau of Reclamation and the amount of water that Arizona and Nevada can take out of the Colorado River is modestly reduced. If the water level of Lake Mead continues to fall, increasing limits are imposed on the amount of Colorado River water that can be withdrawn by those states.

The Tier Zero Shortage declared by the Bureau of Reclamation in August 2019 triggered mandatory reductions in the water that Arizona and Nevada could take from the Colorado River in 2020. Arizona’s share of the cuts for 2020 total 192,000 af or a 12 percent reduction in CAP water deliveries in Arizona. CAP water deliveries to agriculture will be the first deliveries to be cut. Deliveries to agriculture will be reduced by about 15 percent. If, as has been feared for
 
several years, Lake Mead’s water level drops below 1,075 feet (Tier 1), Arizona will have to reduce its annual take from Lake Mead by a much more disruptive 512,000 acre-feet.
It will be Arizona farms that would first face reductions in CAP water deliveries. If the Lake Mead water level declines even further, other reductions in access to Colorado River water will be imposed on Arizona. If the level of Lake Mead falls another 50 feet to 1,025 feet (Tier 3), Arizona will suffer another cutback in the water CAP can deliver, to an overall cut of 720,000 af per year. At that point municipalities and industrial customers of CAP would also face reduced deliveries.

In this context of regional water shortage and reductions in CAP access to Colorado River water, it is misleading for the DEIS to mention in the Summary, without comment, that it is RCM’s intention to “use water…directly from the Central Arizona Project (CAP) canal” to meet its substantial “external water needed for the life of the mine…” RCM’s alternative source
of water supply is tapping groundwater below the Desert Wellfield along the MARRCO corridor in the East Salt River Valley and other as yet unidentified regions..

As “Appendix H: Further Details of Mine Water Balance and Use” points out, RCM has applied to obtain a Non-Indian Agriculture Central Arizona Project contract; “this could offset groundwater pumping through direct delivery of water [to RCM]; however, this contract has not been approved or completed and therefore CAP water use is not considered in this appendix (H).” The DEIS should not lend credence to RCM’s hopes that despite the shortage of water in Arizona and the cutback of CAP deliveries of water, CAP will be willing and able to deliver water directly to the proposed Resolution Mine.
3.	The Impact of Water Shortage on the Arizona Economy

The efforts by RCM to physically procure a very large amount of additional water for a new use will unavoidably drive up the price of Arizona water as well as ensure that some users will have to give up water they have used in the past. The Bureau of Reclamation has announced the reduction in allocations of Colorado River water to Arizona for 2020 because of low water levels in Lake Mead. There is the distinct likelihood that those limits on CAP delivery of water to Arizona will increase sharply if the water elevation in Lake Mead continues to decline. Because of the different priority of the water rights held by Arizona water users served by CAP, the  impact of the loss of access to CAP water will not be uniform nor localized with any specificity. Some water users will be impacted in 2020 while others will see little change unless the level of Lake Mead continues to decline significantly. Initially use of CAP water for water banking or groundwater recharge will be eliminated. Then Arizona agricultural operations will face reduced water deliveries. CAP water being delivered to municipalities and industries will not see cuts in deliveries unless falling Lake Mead levels lead to a declaration of a Tier 3 shortage. If Lake  Mead falls low enough, all CAP deliveries will cease. This reallocation of water away from historical users, such as current CAP-supplied agricultural operations while industrial and municipal water users continue to get their full allocation is an unavoidable cost associated with the shrinking supply of water while the demand for water continues to increase. Between 2010 and 2018 Arizona was the fourth fastest growing state in terms of population. The growing population and the growing economy necessitated ncreased water demand. RCM’s new water demand will aggravate the struggle to balance water supply and demand.

The DEIS estimates that under the Proposed Action (Alternative 2), the RCM will need  about 600,000 acre-feet of water over its projected 40-year life. Averaged over the 40-year life of the mine, the RCM average annual need for outside water would be 15,000 af per year. The average annual delivery of water by the CAP in 2018 was about 1.5 million acre-feet of water.
The average annual water use of the RCM project would be about one percent of the annual  water deliveries by CAP. This may be interpreted as a relatively small impact, but recent studies of the impact of increased or decreases water supplies on the Arizona economy by the L. William Seidman Research Institute at Arizona State University concluded otherwise. We will discuss those studies below.

Water is an important raw material used in many economic activities. Clearly the RCM copper mining, ore concentrator, and waste tailings disposal operations will require large quantities of water. Water is also a very important input for Arizona agriculture given the arid climate and limited rainfall. Simple habitation in a desert setting requires a substantial water supply to make urban living possible. One very direct way of measuring the economic contribution of water is to look at the dollar volume of economic activity created by industries that rely heavily on the use of water. A recent study by the L. William Seidman Research  Institute at Arizona State University took this approach to estimate the economic activity created by industries that received water from the Central Arizona Project. Another study carried out by the same researchers, looked at the economic activity supported in the Colorado River Basin area by the Colorado River’s water.

This ASU study concluded that the availability of the CAP water allowed the Arizona
 
economy to grow in real terms by over one trillion dollars, an almost 50 percent increase in annual economic activity between 1986 and 2010. This conclusion was also interpreted as showing how a lack of access to that CAP water would have seriously hobbled the economic development of the Arizona economy. Stated as additional economic activity that CAP water supported or the decline in economic activity if the CAP water disappeared, this estimated economic impact of CAP water is very large in both relative and absolute terms.

This is not surprising since the loss of that incremental CAP water was projected to slow down the annual rate of growth of the overall Arizona economy. That projected slower economic growth had significant cumulative impacts across the entire Arizona economy over a 25-year study period. If the ASU CAP study results are rephrased in terms of the economic activity created per acre-foot of new water made available by CAP, the average real economic impact
created appears to be about $40,000 per acre-foot of additional water.


When a farm or ranch leases additional water to grow additional crops or more water- intensive crops, the water is just one of the many inputs into the agricultural production process. In theory, the farmer would not pay any more for the water than the incremental value that additional water would add to the production process. In some settings of high valued crops (head lettuce, almonds, citrus fruits), that incremental value may well be in the thousands of dollars per acre-foot. But for most farm operations, it is likely to be lower than that. On the other hand, if one is calculating the “economic impact” of water on the level of economic activity, the loss of irrigation water may be used to explain that decline in agricultural activity or water intensive industrial activity. That is, the loss of that economic activity may be ascribed entirely to the lack of available water. Then, indirect and induced impacts of that decline in agricultural activity can also be calculated and included in the “total economic impact” of the decline in water availability. No one would pay the value of that “lost economic activity” to purchase the water because that water has to be combined with many other capital and operations costs to produce that “additional economic activity” and no one can actually collect those indirect and induced benefits to help pay for the water.

These two studies of the economic role of water in the Arizona economy and in the  Colorado River Basin economy estimated the economic impact of an additional acre-foot of water to be between $40,000 and $50,000 per year. At that rate, the loss of 15,000 af per year of water would lead to a loss of $600 to $750 million per year. Cumulatively, over a forty-year period, i.e. the life of RCM, the lost economic activity due to the reduction in water available for use would be $24 to $30 billion if, as expected, water supply and demand in Arizona and the southwest continue out of balance due to climate change and continued economic growth. .

The 15,000 acre-feet of water per year that the RCM will need to import in order to operate may appear to be a small part of the total use of water in Arizona, but, according to these Arizona State University studies, the impact on economic activity would be significant.

Water supply in Arizona and the Lower Colorado Basin states is out of balance with water demand and has been for a relatively long time. A discussion of the historic origins of this imbalance in water supply and demand is beyond the scope of these comments. The result has been falling water levels in the Lower Basin’s major reservoirs: Lake Mead and Lake Powell which currently contain only 40 to 50 percent of their design capacity. Water levels in those reservoirs have been declining for many years as a result of water removal exceeding water inflow. With the reservoir levels reaching critical levels, for the first time water users’ water rights are being overridden by mandatory reductions in the use of Lake Mead’s water. Most of the burden of that adjustment will fall on Arizona in the Lower Basin and, within Arizona, on agricultural water users. If the imbalance between water supply and water demand continues, municipalities and industries, too, will begin to lose access to the water that they had rights to in the past.

Adjustments will be made. The physical reality of the shortage of water cannot be ignored. It is unlikely that the adjustment will be smooth. Different water users’ water rights have different priorities, so the impact of adjustment will fall unevenly on different individuals and organizations. As mentioned above, agriculture’s access to CAP water will be one of the first impacts. Agricultural operations raising high-valued crops may be able to afford to pump or purchase additional water and/or to invest in more efficient use of their now smaller water allocation. Agricultural operations raising lower-valued crops that are also raised throughout the region may not be able to adjust their operations or afford to obtain supplemental water on their own and will reduce production or sell their operations.

In most rural areas, agriculture is not just another type of industry where workers can earn a
 
living. It is also a way of life that is considered important to maintain and support. It has roots in the history and culture of the region. Its loss can contribute to the depopulation of rural areas and the loss of local schools and community. Alternatively, the availability of the land can encourage ongoing ex-urban sprawl and loss of historical and cultural roots. At the federal, state, and local levels, public efforts seek to support the continuation of agriculture as part of the local economic base. There is a social value attributed to agriculture, especially to “family” farms and ranches. The water shortage that will soon limit CAP water deliveries in Arizona will be another force undermining the viability of agricultural operations. It is reasonable to look closely at that socioeconomic impact and understand the forces at work and whether there are public policies that can support agricultural operations and what are the costs associated with those policies.

The DEIS does not discuss the socioeconomic impact of the impending increase in the competition for water in Arizona to which the proposed RCM will contribute.

"3.13.06","Socioeconomics: BoomBust Cycles","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","1.	Background: Flickering Economic Impacts of Arizona’s Copper Industry

One important explanation for the poor economic performance of local economies specializing in metal mining despite the very high wage characteristics of that industry is the instability of employment and income associated with mineral development activity. The experience of Arizona with copper mining dramatizes this.

Arizona has had over a century of economic history with copper mining, concentrating, refining, and smelting. During that time, the demands for American copper ore and metal have constantly fluctuated. Over the last 110 years one can count at least seven major booms followed by busts in which copper production fell by as much as 75 percent and most recently fell by more than half, 54 percent, between 1998-2011. Those “busts” almost always involved declines in copper production of a quarter to a third or more. See Figure A below. With those declines in copper production, of course, came declines in employment, payrolls, mine purchases of  supplies, and payments of state and local taxes.
[see figures A,B,C for caption and figure]
The source of these repeated cycles of expanded copper production followed by steep declines in copper production was the constant fluctuation in the international price of copper that regularly changed the profitability of existing operating copper mines, concentrators,
 
smelters, and refineries leading them to increase or decrease their production. See Figure B below. The opening of new mines pursuing new ore deposits and the closing of older mines because of the exhaustion of their ore deposits was never the primary cause of this “boom and bust.”



Note the steep rise in copper prices from about $1 per pound in 2002 to about $4.30 per pound in 2011. (All prices expressed in 2015 dollars of constant purchasing power.) That was accompanied by Arizona copper operations rebuilding their workforce. Copper prices then slid steeply downward beginning in 2011, carrying copper prices below $2 per pound in early 2016. Job growth in Arizona’s copper industry reversed itself as copper operations began laying off workers in 2015.
Copper, like most commodities sold on national or international markets, suffers through irregular but repeated cycles. When international demand for copper rises, prices will move upward motivating existing mines to increase their production to take advantage of the now more profitable market. In addition, the expanding international demand will lead new mines to be  built that will add to the overall level of worldwide production sold into international markets. At some point, the increase in supply exceeds the overall level of demand, and the over-supply on the market begins to drive copper prices down. As a result, production from some sources becomes unprofitable at the new lower prices and international copper production is scaled back, at first modestly. Then as copper prices continue to tumble there are larger and larger reductions in production including the closing of higher costs mines, smelters, etc. Just as increases in  supply tend to overshoot demand, decreases in supply ultimately also result in a supply inadequate to meet demand and copper prices begin to rise again. Such commodity production and price cycles are common to many national and international markets where lags in the adjustment in both supply and demand prevent markets from maintaining a stable equilibrium balance. Instead commodity prices, including copper prices, tend to be volatile as do copper production, employment, and payrolls.
These repeated fluctuations in the demand for and price of copper leads to ongoing fluctuations in copper mine employment, payroll, supply and equipment purchases, and tax payments. Analysts have come to call this irregular but ongoing instability in the economic impact of metal mining on local communities a “flicker” effect. Arizona copper industry employment over the last forty-six years dramatically demonstrates this volatility in copper industry employment. Employment regularly increases by 5,000 to 15,000 jobs and then tumbles downward in the same dramatic way. See Figure C above.

Besides the constant “flicker” of production and employment in the copper industry, there has also been significant collapses in overall copper industry employment. In 1974, Arizona copper industry employment peaked at about 29,000 workers. By 2003 the number of jobs had tumbled to 5,900, four out of five of the copper mining jobs had disappeared. In total, 22,800 copper mining jobs had disappeared. There was a recovery between 2003 and 2008 but then the “flicker” returned as employment dipped again in 2009, laying off 2,100 workers only to recover to 2008 job levels by 2013. Copper prices then plunged again and the layoffs began again.

These repeated and substantial fluctuations in copper industry employment have an unavoidable negative impact on local communities and economies. Workers and their families  do not know how long their jobs will last or how long the relatively high pay will circulate within the local economy. That discourages investments by miners in the areas around the mines
 
as well as investments by other businesses in the local commercial infrastructure. Because tax payments by mining companies often fluctuate with the price of copper and the level of copper production, state and local governments also do not know what tax base they can rely on when contemplating investments in public infrastructure. The result of that volatility in the revenues associated with copper mining is a hesitation across the board to investment in the local economy. That partially explains the relatively run down and depressed character of many mining communities despite the high levels of pay in mining and the huge volume of wealth extracted by those mines.

These periodic booms and busts in copper production and employment have disruptive impacts on the communities in the vicinity of the copper mines that prevent the high wages associated with copper mining from having a reliable positive impact on local economic vitality and stability. The DEIS recognizes this: The “overview” of the socioeconomics section (3.13) ends with the statement that “Historically, mining in Arizona has followed a ‘boom and bust cycle, which potentially leads to great economic uncertainty.” (DEIS p. 640) The DEIS however does not incorporate these important economic characteristics of copper mining into its analysis of socioeconomic impacts. As a result it depicts the socioeconomic impacts associated with additional copper mining as large, stable, and positive. This ignores a century of Arizona experience with the copper industry that clearly indicates otherwise.
"
"3.13.06","Socioeconomics: BoomBust Cycles","3.13","Section 3.13 - Socioeconomics","2.	The DEIS’ Projection of Almost Perfectly Stable Operations of the Proposed RCM for Half a Century

Despite the DEIS recognizing the past volatility of the Arizona copper industry in terms of employment and payroll, the DEIS models the socioeconomics impacts of the RCM by assuming the RCM will operate with perfectly stable employment and payroll for almost a half-century.
Figure I-1 below is taken from the BBC Socioeconomic Effects Technical Report. It provides a dramatic graphic representation of this assumed, perfectly stable, operation of RCM for almost fifty years. Direct employment at the RCM is projected to be exactly the same each year, about 1,400, from 2029 until 2077. Recall Figure C above that showed the actual volatility in the Arizona copper industry employment over the past half-century.

The assumptions made by the DEIS depart significantly from Arizona’s historical experience with copper mining. This is one way in which the proponents of a new mine turn away from actual historic experience to paint a much more positive picture of the socioeconomic impacts of  a new copper mine by asserting that “this time will be different.” The painful historical experiences are dismissed on the basis that the ore body is different, the technology that will be used is different, and the pollution control measures are far superior to what has been used in the past. As a result, the argument continues, the production costs associated with RCM will be significantly lower and the mining operation will be significantly more profitable. This, it is concluded, will allow the RCM to continue operating when international copper prices tumble downward. For almost a half-century-long production period, the DEIS asserts, RCM will be   able to operate at its full design capacity and with a workforce of fixed size for the time it will take to mine out the ore body.

The DEIS did not provide any significant detail on exactly why performance of the RCM will be different from the histories of other copper mines with which Arizona has had experience. The justification the DEIS did provide for this assumption of stability in the operation of the RCM despite the historical volatility of the performance of the copper industry in Arizona is largely a set of circular assumptions: The DEIS assumed this stability because that is RCM’s best-case hopes:

“Presuming that Resolution Copper’s projections of operational employment, labor costs, non-labor operating costs, and output prove reasonably accurate, the proposed Resolution Copper Mine would have lower operating costs than the typical conventional copper mines in the region.

Rephrasing the above quote: “If RCM’s assumptions about the performance of their proposed mine are correct, the results will be as RCM projected.” Simply “presuming” that what RCM hopes will be true will turn out to be true, does not represent a documented empirical conclusion. The DEIS’s reference to RCM being projected to have lower costs than other “conventional mines in the region,” is largely irrelevant. RCM will not be competing with those regional mines but with copper producers worldwide. It is that international market that largely sets copper commodity prices.

Yet, as shown above (Figure C), copper industry employment in Arizona has been anything but steady over the last 64 years. Every five to ten years, the Arizona copper industry has moved dramatically up or down. Nothing in recent experience in Arizona would suggest that that volatility has been banished. Since 1994 there have been six significant movements, both up and down, in Arizona copper industry employment.

RCM’s projection of steady employment is based on its projection of how much copper ore there is to mine in the ore deposit. It is an estimate of what the employment level would have to be to extract that ore over almost a half-century period. That arithmetic procedure provides no evidence that it will actually be financially feasible for RCM to mine the entire targeted ore body at a fixed rate of annual extraction and a workforce of a fixed size.

Also, as pointed out above, it is important to recognize that most of the instability in copper mining employment, payroll, mine purchases of supplies and equipment, and tax payments is not due to mines coming to the planned end of their economic lives and shutting down. Much of the instability is tied to existing mines increasing and decreasing their level of production and employment due to changing copper market conditions, the retooling of the mining process with labor saving technology, strikes, and accidents.

In projecting likely economic impacts associated with a proposed copper mine, these fluctuations in production and employment need to be incorporated into the projected impacts. If that is not done, a misleading impression of only positive socioeconomic impacts is intentionally or unintentionally created. The impact analysis will only show permanent increases in employment, payroll, mine purchases, etc. that then are projected to endure over several decades. The analysis will project higher and stable employment and mine spending with little or no volatility. The historical data and experience with copper mining in Arizona clearly do not support that type of performance from the copper industry. The DEIS socioeconomic section and “Socioeconomic Effects Technical Report” developed to support the DEIS will mislead both the public and decision-makers if it depicts the RCM as creating only stable, long-term socioeconomic “benefits” with no associated socioeconomic costs due to the inherent instability associated with copper mining.

The Arizona experience with copper mining over the last half-century or more tells a
 
different story that the DEIS suppresses. For instance, between 1997 and 2005 the contained copper produced in Arizona fell steadily from a peak of 1.4 million short tons to 776,000 short tons, a loss of about half (45 percent) of the 1997 level of production. But this was not due to Arizona’s copper mines running out of copper causing major mines to shut down permanently. Rather, after real copper prices per pound had fluctuated in the $1.50 to $2.50 per pound range between 1983 and 1995, real copper prices declined beginning in 1995 to $1.00 or less per pound during the 1998-2004 period. The result was a cut back in Arizona copper mining and processing as copper mining companies waited for prices to return to a profitable level. By 2006 copper prices were back above $3.00 per pound, peaking ultimately close to $4 per pound and Arizona copper producers began bringing their mines and copper ore processing facilities back to full production. The Great Recession in 2007-2009 caused an additional price stumble, but copper prices stayed above $2.50 per pound. Copper prices rose sharply between 2009 and 2011,  peaking well over $4 per pound before falling equally quickly to just above $2 per pound.
Layoffs began again. See Figure C above.

Such copper price fluctuations can take place at any time, leading copper producers to scale back their operations until prices move back into a profitable range. Recall Figure B above that showed 115 years of copper price fluctuations with significant declines occurring, on average, every seven years or so. It is these fluctuations that have made copper mining an irregular source of support for Arizona’s copper communities and discouraged private and public investments based on the fluctuating levels of employment, income, purchases, and tax  payments. When, as in Figure C above, 60 percent of Arizona copper industry employment can be eliminated in a 6-year period (1981 to 1987) or 55 percent of copper industry jobs can again  be eliminated in another 7-year period (1996-2003), the local economy suffers a significant loss and is disrupted in ways from which it cannot easily recover.

Just as the new jobs associated with a new copper mine can have a strong positive impact on the local economy, massive job losses can have a strong negative impact on the local economy that must be carefully considered too because we know that it is not unlikely
3.	Comparing the Operating Costs of Mining and the Market Value of Copper

The DEIS provides only a brief discussion of why the output, employment, payroll, and expenditures associated with the RCM will not “flicker” over time, destabilizing the economies in the vicinity the way copper mines have in the past. The DEIS provides a single paragraph discussing the RCM’s “vulnerability to boom-bust cycles.” (p. 653) The DEIS asserts that RCM “would have lower operating costs than the typical conventional copper mines...” This is important because when copper prices are below a mine’s operating costs, it will be forced to cut back or shut done operations in order to minimize losses.

For that reason, a firm with quite low variable costs will continue to operate in the face of declining market prices when firms with higher variable costs would cut back production because they were losing money on each unit produced. The DEIS (p. 653) asserts that the variable costs that RCM will face will be so low, that RCM will be able to continue to operate when other mining companies are suspending production for purely economic reasons. In that sense, the DEIS concludes that, RCM will generate less economic flicker than existing and past Arizona copper mines have.

BBC Research & Consulting’s “Socioeconomic Effects Technical Report” provides more detail on that claim about the stability of RCM operations in Section II, “Vulnerability to Boom- Bust Cycles.” BBC estimated the variable per unit costs of copper production for three quite different phases of the ramp up to full production (10 years), full production (20 years), and declining production and closure (10 years). During each of these periods the production levels and the variable operating costs per pound of copper would be different. (Section II Page 1). See Table A, below.
According to these BBC estimates of the RCM operating costs, if the RCM is going to at least cover its variable operating costs, copper prices will have to be above $1.50 per pound during the ramp up to full production and $1.90 per pound in the ramp down to closure. For the extended 20-year period of full production, copper prices would have to be above $0.90 per pound.

BBC in its Figure II-2 shows the same USGS historical real copper prices for the 115- year period 1900 to 2015 that we show in Figure B above. Comparison of that historical data on real copper prices with the projected real variable operating costs of RCM provides some indication as to how likely it is that real copper prices might dip below RCM’s variable operating costs, leading RCM to reduce or halt production at the mine because of the low copper prices.

Historical copper prices adjusted for inflation are shown in Figure B above as well as BBC’s Figure II-2. During the 115 years of real copper prices provided by USGS, those prices rarely dipped below $1.00 per pound. So if RCM can actually keep its operating costs below
$1.00 per pound of copper, it will not reduce or cease copper production for purely economic reasons during its “full production” operations. This assumes that the RCM operating cost estimates are reliable. We will discuss that below.

The highest cost operating period in the projected economic life of RCM is the 10-years  of ramping down towards closure. The operating cost per pound would be over twice what is projected for the full production period: $1.90 per pound. BBC pointed out that over the last 50- years of historical copper price data, real copper prices have fallen below that $1.90 critical value 38 percent of the time. For that reason, there would appear to be a substantial risk that RCM might terminate operations early during this last and most expensive period of its operation because of low copper prices.


For the ramp up period to full production, the RCM operating costs are projected to be $1.50 per pound. The historical copper price data indicates that the likelihood that market copper prices would not cover operating costs at that level is small but not insignificant: Real copper prices were below this level 18 percent of the time during the last 50-years of historical copper prices. But this phase of the development of the RCM is not exclusively aimed at mining copper ore. It  is also part of the construction phase that allows the mine to reach the ore body that it intends to mine for twenty years. Since it cannot access the ore body and mine it at low cost without extending the mine to the ore body while harvesting ore along the way, RCM is unlikely to shut down the expansion of the mine and processing of the ore and abandon the most profitable part  of the mining operation because of “temporarily” low copper prices. The ramp up phase is likely to proceed even if market prices fall below the operating costs during that initial phase of the mine unless the overall view of the international copper market is negative for the foreseeable future.

Before a mine begins to be constructed and operated, many of its cost remain uncertain despite the studies of mining engineers, geologists, hydrologists, and financial analysts. RCM is not an exception. RCM began drilling its No. 10 shaft, a 6,943-foot-deep, 28-foot-diameter shaft that was both intended for exploration and as the primary access point for the underground mine. In late 2012, geothermal water at 170 degrees F. began flowing into the shaft at a high rate.
Consultants had told Resolution that the shaft would face little or no water below 4,000 ft. It was at about 6,500 feet when the hot water from an underground aquifer began rushing in. The result of the unexpected discovery of the geothermal water was a two-year delay in drilling to allow for the installation of upgraded pumping, refrigeration and ventilation equipment. The shaft was completed in 2014.

The large and very hot geothermal water flow increased the cost of operating the mine in several ways. More pumping had to take place to keep the facilities and mine at the bottom of the
 
shaft dry. That required the purchasing of more electricity. More electricity also had to be used to refrigerate a hotter mine and increase the ventilation to deal with the gases exsolving from the geothermal water. The 100 percent humidity, saturated, air required the more frequent replacement of equipment because of increased corrosion. RCM also had to replace the pumps it had in place.

As the construction of the mine continues and more and more rock is shattered in the mining process, other geothermal groundwater flows or other unforeseeable problems may occur that need to be resolved by RCM resulting in still higher costs. RCM has not disclosed the cost of mitigating this geothermal groundwater event.

Dr. Emerman’s report also disputes RCM’s estimates of its electrical and water needs for the RCM project. He has estimated that an additional 24 mw (best case) to 1,650 mw (worst case) of electrical capacity over RCM’s estimate would be needed solely for mine dewatering and refrigeration. He also estimated that the overall water needs of the mine and supporting facilities would be much higher (50,000 acre-feet) than Resolution’s estimate of 15,700 acre-feet.

Rio Tinto, the majority and controlling part in Resolution, is also developing the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. That mine would also use the panel caving technique RCM plans to use. However, initial vertical drilling has indicated that the basement rock does not have the structural strength to create the room below the ore body so that the caving can safely and effectively be carried out. They are also trying to drill shafts through which ore would be lifted and ventilation air brought in. Drilling of Shaft 2 was delayed at least a year in 2018 because of rock stability problems. Geotechnical information and modeling now suggest that there may be stability risks identified with the approved mine design and so a number of other mine design options are under consideration. The solutions to the problems are expected to cost significantly more and require construction delays while new mine designs are analyzed, chosen and implemented.

The point here is that until a mine is actually under construction and the ore is being accessed, it is difficult to estimate what the construction and operation costs are likely to be. The panel caving technique is being pursued by Rio Tinto because it is a bulk ore removal method that, if workable, allows large amounts of ore to be extracted at relatively low cost to Rio Tinto. As we are seeing with both Rio Tinto mines, the actual costs being incurred, and the actual mine design being used can be quite different from those laid out in earlier General Operating Plans. The costs associated with both mines are now uncertain as the mining company adjusts its mining plan to cope with the actual on-the-ground conditions that are being encountered as mine development proceeds.


The DEIS ignores these on the ground mine development risks, changes in mining plans, and mitigation costs while confidently projecting quite low mine production costs that are expected to last for decades. This may cheer investors, but such overly optimistic projections do not support good decision making by the public and public land managers.

"IA01","Issues Analysis: Proposed New Issue","IA","Issues Analysis","DEIS Deficiency No. 5: Social Costs Associated with Mining
1.	The DEIS does not discuss the social disruption to Superior of the inflow and outflow of 1,500 transient mine workers.  Such flows of miners into  and out of small communities are known to be associated with significant social costs that undermine quality of life in small communities in the vicinity of the mine.
Not all changes that come with mining can be quantified in the same way. Some things are easy to quantify, for example, the direct payments to the miners or the direct employment of the miners at the mine site. These jobs and payroll are generally the first things that are touted when  a new mine is proposed in a local area. What is not e as clear are the costs to the local town of having a large, predominately male, transient, and high paid work force come to town 365 days a year. The DEIS used BBC’s estimate of the added costs to the town in terms of increased  services, but the DEIS has not looked at some of the darker costs associated with mining towns. Some of those costs are associated with a transient work force that is not invested in the local community, increased calls to the local police, increased alcoholism, increased drug use, increased domestic violence and abuse, etc. In this comment on the DEIS, we will look at the literature that has linked mining to some of these social maladies that are often completely left out of the discussion of the potential costs to the local communities closest to the mine. Those costs are not considered or quantified in the DEIS.

Since there is not a large body of literature on social maladies associated with small Arizona copper mining towns, we will look to all of the literature that takes into account mining and social costs. This spans the gamut from coal, to natural gas, to gold, and of course copper mines
 
from around the U.S. and indeed the world. Although these are very different geographies, with different mining techniques and different minerals that are being extracted, the social problems that are encountered are remarkably similar.

a.	The Size of the Local Impact on the City of Superior

According to the DEIS, RCM will create about 1,500 jobs in Superior. When the limited “multiplier impacts” are included, the total number of new jobs in the Superior zip code will be about 1,600. BBC estimates that limited housing in Superior would initially lead only 10 percent of the RCM workers to choose to live in Superior.

If Superior were to develop as a result of the stimulus from the RCM operations, BBC speculates that as many as 381 of the RCM workers or 25 percent, could choose to live in Superior. And another 10 percent could choose to live elsewhere in the Copper Triangle. The remaining 65 percent of the workers would continue to commute into Superior from the Greater Phoenix area (Maricopa County). We have already discussed above (DEIS Deficiency No. 2.) why we do not think that many RCM workers will choose to live in the Superior area.
This implies both a large impact and a very tiny impact depending on what the reference point is. For the Town of Superior this would be a very large impact. The total workforce in Superior now is about 1,200. The number of workers in Superior would more than double from about 1,200 to about 2,800 as a result of the RCM project. But the vast majority of these new workers would commute in and out of Superior each and every day as RCM schedules workers to operate mine and mine facilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Given that the workforce in Maricopa County is about 2 million workers, this commuting out of Maricopa County to jobs in Superior would not have a significant impact on those workers’ hometowns. However, the daily commute of 1,600 workers into the relatively small town of Superior would have a significant impact in Superior as a substantial group of workers would arrive and depart with each shift change every day of the year.
b.	Mining Town Maladies: A Look into the Dark Side of Mining’s Social Impacts There are many important social issues associated with mining in rural areas that have
significant impacts on the well-being of residents and communities that are often not discussed, e.g., increases in alcohol and drug consumption, increased pressure on local law enforcement, increased incidence of sexual and aggravated physical assaults, increased presence of convicted felons, etc. These impacts will not show up in the typical commercial statistics on jobs and income that are used to document the benefits of expanded mineral extraction, but these social

changes can have substantial impacts on resident well-being.

Small towns near a new or expanding mine typically experience an increased pressure on the police force and many other social services provided by local governments. There can be a myriad of different reasons for this, but the basic principal is easy to understand: Increased population requires the police and other social services providers to do more work. This  statement was highlighted by Archbold in “Policing the Patch”, where “the Patch” referred to the Bakken “oil patch.” In that study Archbold reported that 80 percent of the officers interviewed said the oil boom had affected their work. While the impacts were many and varied the most basic impact was that the officers were called out for service significantly more than they had been before the oil boom in the Bakken. In fact, “…Four out of the eight police agencies  included in this study have had triple the number of calls for service since 2008. One agency had double the number of calls for service…” Police get called out on all sorts of service calls, but  the basic fact that the Bakken area had 2-3 times the service calls to the police since the oil boom got well underway points to something in the community dramatically changing due to the oil boom, serious enough that residents asked the police for assistance much more often.

Other studies of the Bakken area of North Dakota and Montana have shed some light on the kinds of calls to which the police were responding. Jayasundrara found that nearly all of the regional analyses had an increase in domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It is also important to mention that in the Jayasundrara study they caution that: “…not all communities in the Bakken region had the same experiences, and some were more affected than others…” That there was an increase in violent crime in the Bakken (North Dakota and Montana) mirrors directly the experience in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania which saw a 30 percent increase in violent crime as the unconventional gas boom developed there. Lest we think that this is a problem for “other states” and not Arizona, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence reminds us that it is most certainly a problem in Arizona also.

The influx of strangers into areas experiencing a mining boom may undermine existing
 
community social controls on resident behavior and create an environment attractive to those  with a history of criminal behavior. One study of energy development in the Greater Yellowstone region found that the number of Registered Sex Offenders grew about 2-3 times faster in  counties dependent on oil and gas extraction relative to those dependent on recreation or agriculture.

The same sort of story is told in Australia where mining towns in Queensland experienced rates of violence to which police responded increasing between 1.4 and 2.3 times the state average at the five different mining communities studied. While no two communities are identical, the added presence of a significant number of new mine workers is likely to increase the service calls to the police and other social services, and there will likely be a rise in the number of assault cases. As Ennis and Finlayson, who studied the Boom Town of Darwin, Australia, put it:

“There must be recognition of the likely impact of resource industry structures, workplace practices and culture, and the local “frontier” cultures which combine to support high levels of alcohol consumption and associated violence. Until this occurs, the alcohol and violence-related social disruptions will continue to be a hallmark of any boomtown scenario but especially for Darwin.”

Much of the literature on mining town maladies attempts to draw a correlation between community dependence on mining and alcohol use and abuse. In the Northwest Territories of Canada, which have seen a large increase in mining in the last decade, Gibson has quoted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP): “The RCMP estimates that 80% of crime is directly or indirectly related to alcohol or drug abuse.” In the United States, in fact, mining has had the top billing as the drunkest industry. According to Bush:

“Workers in the mining (17.5 percent) and construction (16.5 percent) industries had the highest rates of past month heavy alcohol use.”

This was the second time in a row that mining had topped this list of industries by level of alcohol use. While we might be tempted to think that this was just a U.S. problem, studies focused on mining-impacted communities around the world show that it is a common problem no matter where the mining town is located.

The influx of strangers into areas experiencing a mining boom may undermine existing community social controls on resident behavior and create an environment attractive to those  with a history of criminal behavior. One study of energy development in the Greater Yellowstone region found that the number of Registered Sex Offenders grew about 2-3 times faster in

counties dependent on oil and gas extraction relative to those dependent on recreation or agriculture.

One should not be shocked by these findings. A large group of single, transient, males who work long hours out of sync with the local standard work day and week, who have a large amount of money to spend and have long blocks of idle time, are not likely to make good neighbors without significant public planning and provision of support services.

Any town located nearby a proposed mine should prepare itself to counter these specific maladies. The most basic steps that need to be taken would be an increase in police presence, the creation of outreach programs for substance abuse and domestic abuse, and some type of plan to try and assimilate the miners into the local culture. Is there a large enough police force, can the police force work more hours, or do they need to hire more police? Are there social services available for the inevitable spike in violence and substance abuse? Is there enough housing if the miners are going to be housed in the local area? For example, in the Bakken, where oil workers had to find their own shelter, housing was a serious issue that the area is just now sorting out. If the miners are being housed in “man camps,” will they be traveling back to their “hometowns” on their block breaks or staying in one of the towns in the vicinity of the mine? These are the sorts of questions that need to be asked and concrete strategies need to be developed before the mine is in full swing.

c.	The Transience of Mine Workers

The volatility of international markets for commodities such as copper, oil, or coal has always led to fluctuations in the level of employment and payroll in the extractive industries. Employment and payroll tend to “flicker” as mines adjust their levels of production to market conditions. Given that miners are very mobile, this can lead to fluctuations in population and expanded ripple effects in the local economy. This can lead to fluctuating impacts in local rural
 
communities as these waves of workers come and go.

There may be limited hiring from the existing, local population because the high pay associated with mining jobs is partially tied to the experience and skill of people with past mining employment. For example, how many people that live in the town of Superior will be able to pilot the robotic mining equipment that will be used? This is not going to be the typical open pit or even underground mining scenario. The people that are operating the mining equipment will not simply be utilizing conventional underground mining techniques. This type of mining is highly specialized and will require a very specialized skill set. Because many of the local residents do not have these skills, it is very likely that the vast majority of the people that come to work at the mine every day will be from outside of the town of Superior.

Others have described how this transient nature of mine work and mine workers make it   hard for mining communities to invest in the services that the in-commuting workers will use. Although a local area might well know that a mine is coming, they may be reluctant to invest in the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the new workers for a number of different reasons. Since most of the workers will be living outside of Superior in the Phoenix metropolitan area, it may be unclear how much strain they will put on local resources. If the mine is housing people in the local community, residents may be reticent to invest in providing services to a population of transient strangers. According to Ruddell:

“Demands on a community’s physical infrastructure (such as water, sewage, waste, housing, roads, and transportation), as well as health, social, education, and protective services (emergency medical, fire, and law enforcement) increase but often there is a political reluctance to invest in these services as population increases are sometimes short-lived, or followed by an economic bust. Consequently, there is often a lag between the recognition of a boom and the time when local services actually match the community’s needs. “

It can be hard for a local community to invest in the increased infrastructure and services to support in-commuting or in-migrating workers to a new mine because it is hard to tell how long they will be in town. In the Ruddell quote above, the lack of investment in the Fort McMurray area led to a crime rate three times higher than the national average and ranked Fort McMurray  in the top five Canadian cities for violent crime in 2009. While the police worker per capita ratio finally reached that average in 2009, it lagged well behind the national average for the two decades that preceded 2009 precisely because the local government was reluctant to invest in public services for transient workers and industry.

The uncertainty associated with volatile global commodity values that leads to uncertainty about the level of mineral production, number of jobs, total payroll, and revenues to local
governments also leads to hesitation on the part of local governments, local businesses, and residents to make investments that might be stranded or lost if world mineral prices turn downward. It is not just hesitation to expand local government budgets, for instance for  additional police. School districts are also likely to be hesitant to expand schools to handle the increased population. Small businesses will be hesitant to invest in the expansion of their businesses given the uncertainty about future resident spending, and residents, including miners, may be hesitant to invest in new homes in the vicinity of the mine since they might lose value if the markets for the minerals soften or collapse. In the the Town of Superior, since there will be a processing facility in town and a tailings storage facility looming over town, both of which are predicted to negatively impact the value of homes in the area, the new mine workers may not want to invest in the housing in Superior at all. The net result of this unavoidable uncertainty about the level of production at the mine is an overall underinvestment in the community that can lead to the general run-down character of mining towns.
d.	The Impact of Transient Workers on Rural Communities

While above we noted increases in crime and lack of infrastructure and public service investment, it is the social toll that may be the most under-reported and under-analyzed of   mining impacts. Because of the nature of the mining workforce, and the new work schedules that are increasingly used at mine sites, the basic schedules of the local mine workers often do not fit with the local community’s schedules. This can have a number of different impacts as Carrington points out.

“In other words, precarious work practices may have a range of diffuse, often adverse social consequences for individuals and communities, even if work is generously rewarded in economic terms.” And…

“What is clear is that the rapid swelling of local populations in small resident communities potentially imposes enormous pressures on existing local services,
 
infrastructure, amenity and the social fabric.”

***

“On the one hand, median weekly incomes for full-time workers ranged from 1.5 times to almost double the national median income in 2006. On the other hand, good economic times drive up local living costs. In some towns, housing costs have reached exorbitant levels.”

***
“In crude terms, the mining industry has been at the forefront of a trend to encourage trading of miners’ rights, job security and working conditions for higher wages.”

Since the mining workforce is likely to be male, relatively young, not accompanied by family, and have considerable income available for spending, the impact of these workers in a local community could be socially stressful for both the community and workers. In fact, this is almost exactly how they are currently described by BBC:

“Currently, Superior is primarily attracting the mining “transient” population, largely consisting of unmarried skilled trades workers on 3-to-4-year shifts” and that “the limited housing stock and other challenges in attracting new residents are likely to limit the number of mine-related workers that actually move to Superior.”

From Superior’s point of view, we also know that the RCM workforce will be coming and going every day of the year and several hours of every day as shifts change.

“The Resolution Copper Mine, including all facilities described in this document, would operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Figure 2.2.2-4 shows an overview of the entire mining process that would occur at full operation.”

The basic picture for the proposed mine is that there will be a non-local workforce that dwarfs the current working population of Superior. They will be working all day every day at the mine site on shifts that will have them coming and going at all times of the day and night. Even  if the mine workers are perfectly behaved, the simple truth is that their presence will be  disruptive in the most basic sense.

This is not to say that it is impossible for mining towns to adjust and cope and there is some literature that shows, at least when using conventional commercial metrics, that having a large mine near a rural town was not causing problems. But what is clear is that there will be changes
in the local community as it tries to accommodate the new miners as a large contingent of in- commuting non-resident workers as well as an increase in new residents in the Copper Triangle. Superior and other small towns must plan for the arrival of the miners and the stress that they are likely to put on the local services. If a town near a mine has adequate social services to welcome the miners, it is possible that the impacts will be minimized as Hajkowicz found in Australia:

“We find no evidence of systematic negative associations between quality of life and the gross value of minerals production. Instead, mining activity has a positive impact on incomes, housing affordability, communication access, education and employment across regional and remote Australia.”

Note that this conclusion focused primarily on the positive economic outcomes typically emphasized in mine “economic impact” studies: mines provide relatively well-paid jobs. That is the promise of mining. Yet mining areas and towns rarely show the economic affluence and quality of life projected when the mine seeks the required permits. It is partially the social  impacts due to miner transience and mineral market instability that limit the positive impacts associated with the additional jobs and income. Our point is not that mining projects always lead to drunkenness and a concentration of bad actors. In fact, there are some very positive benefits to the miners who hold the jobs and the counties and state agencies that get the taxes. What we are attempting to stress is that there is more to a mine locating near a small local community than the narrow “jobs and income” commercial view of the impact on a local community. This is especially true when looking at the impact on Indigenous or Aboriginal people.

Because of the remote nature associated with many new mining developments and because Indigenous or Native people were often given, relocated, or restricted to remote land, Indigenous people are increasingly impacted by mining developments. While the average Non-indigenous resident of a community is clearly impacted by the transient nature of the mining industry, for the Indigenous residents this impact may be greatly multiplied. The Indigenous cultural structure is
 
even less similar to the block-structure of the new mining working schedule; subsistence hunting and fishing, oral tradition, traditional jobs, and community relations can be strained for Indigenous/Native American people that are hired on by mines. Gibson reports that the Canadian town of Polaris, the northernmost town in Canada, was also the richest in 1992 with a per capita income of almost $93,000 for each of the 200 residents. While towns in Canada used to be created around ore bodies, the government now encourages temporary housing and community developments as the model for mine development to discourage the possibility of a ghost town in the future. Gibson goes on to say that:

“Participation in the mine economy can also alter the subsistence lifestyle. For people employed by the mine, who work long daily hours and a two week on/off schedule, less time can be spent on the land hunting and fishing. A study of the Slave Lake Metis community found 71% of workers employed by the mine reported spending less time on the land (North Slave Metis Association, 2002).”

Along with a lack of time and energy to continue the subsistence lifestyle, since the learning and history of Native societies has traditionally been orally based, “and involve knowledge transmission through observing, decreased hunting practices may also signal the loss of associated knowledge.” This has led to fewer people speaking the Aboriginal languages of the Northwest Territories and has preferentially led the mining companies to hire those more traditionally educated people that rely less on their native languages which in turn discourages their speaking of the native language. Those communities that have been able to change their culture so that they could become more effective miners, and thus lose some of their Indigenous ways, have also reaped the reward of a much higher salary. This, then, further separates them from the other Indigenous communities that are farther from the mine site.

While the plight of the Indigenous mine worker is something of a special case, many of the cultural dislocations that they acutely experience are felt throughout mining towns all around the world. Parkins recognized those experiences in his paper on social structure, fragmentation, and substance abuse in resource-based communities:

“Specifically, the linkages between social structure, community fragmentation, and family dysfunction offer a way of understanding differential resistance and   susceptibility to substance abuse. Five thematic areas were linked to susceptibility in   this study: (1) an economy based on multiple divergent sectors, which gives rise to income disparity and social inequality; (2) a highly transient population, which results in social distancing and lack of social support; (3) shift work, which prevents opportunities for consistent and productive family and community relationships; (4) high incomes, which lead to material competition and financial stress; and (5) a culture of entitlement, which produces certain expectations and perceived privileges among some workers and their families.”


These “thematic” areas are exactly those that must be carefully considered when evaluating the social impacts of mining. It is the combination of these social impacts that leads a mining town or the local area around a mine to become separated from the mine workers and leads to social dysfunction. Whether this dysfunction is happening in Indigenous communities where there is the possibility for an even larger negative impact, or in the more traditional setting of a new mine in other small communities around the world, specific themes appear repeatedly in the literature. A separate culture is created by the mine that, because of its structure, its pay, and the diverse cultures of its workforce, may not fit well with the existing residents of the towns and cities that are closest to that mine. The results are the specific social maladies discussed above.

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Methods

The expected flow rate of geothermal water into the completed underground mine was calculated by starting with the Thiem Equation for steady-state groundwater flow for confined aquifers (Fetter, 2001)

 

𝑇 =
 
[see page 3 for equation]
 

where T is aquifer transmissivity (product of aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity), Q is groundwater discharge (positive in the inward radial direction), and h1 and h2 are the hydraulic heads at distances r1 and r2 from the center of the pumping well, respectively (see Fig. 3). The assumption of steady-state flow is a best-case scenario since the reports by E&MJ (2014) and Phillips (2016) indicate that the entry rate of geothermal water in the No. 10 shaft has increased from 460 to 1400 gpm. The flow rate might be increasing since the high hydraulic gradient created between the open shaft and the aquifer might be causing an increase in the aperture of fractures within the aquifer. On the other hand, the increase in flow rate might result simply from the increase in penetration of the aquifer from the depth of the first encounter with geothermal water until the completion of the shaft. Based on Fig. 2, geothermal water was encountered at a depth of 6458 feet and the flow rate of 460 gpm occurred when the shaft had penetrated 162 feet into the aquifer (6620 feet below the surface). Since the shaft is now 6943 feet deep, the flow rate of 1400 gpm is taking place at an aquifer penetration of 485 feet. The increase in flow rate is remarkably consistent with the increase in penetration based on the ratios 485 ft/162 ft = 2.99 and 1400 gpm/460 gpm = 3.04. Since there is no way to reliably estimate any future increase in flow rate, it will be assumed that the flow rate into the No. 10 shaft will continue to be 1400 gpm indefinitely.

"3.2.06","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: General","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","It has been quite surprising that the 2395 pages of the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) do not include any estimate of total power requirements or any source of power (besides emergency power) except for the local grid of the Salt River Project. A previous report (Emerman, 2018) provided some insight as to why this lack of projected electricity consumption could be a concern for investors. In 2007 drilling began for the 6943-foot-deep, 28-foot-diameter No. 10 shaft, which was intended for both exploration and as the primary access point for the underground mine (E&MJ, 2014). However, in December 2012, geothermal water at a temperature of 170°F began entering the shaft at a rate of 460 gallons per minute (gpm). According to Tom Goodell, general manager – shaft development for Resolution Copper, “Productivity flattened out at 6500 feet…The consultants told us that we would have little or no water below 4000 feet…They kind of missed that call. We hit it all in one spot and it was quite dramatic” (E&MJ, 2014). The Arizona Daily Star confirmed, “Shaft-sinking equipment had reached a depth of about 6,500 feet when water from an underground aquifer began rushing in. The miners were prepared to handle 80 gallons per minute, which is what core samples from 30 feet away predicted” (Bregel, 2016). The result of the unexpected discovery was a two-year delay in drilling for the installation of upgraded pumping, refrigeration and ventilation equipment. The shaft was completed in 2014 and is now the deepest single-lift shaft in the U.S. (EM&J, 2014; Resolution Copper, 2018c). Later reports indicated that the entry rate of geothermal water into the No. 10 shaft had increased by over a factor of three to 1400 gpm and that the temperature of the geothermal water was 180°F (Bregel, 2016; Phillips, 2016).
Neither the existence of the geothermal water, nor the additional costs associated with geothermal water, are mentioned anywhere in the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c). The geothermal water is not even mentioned in any of the discussions of regional hydrology or the potential impacts of mining upon groundwater. This is again surprising, since the document states a publication date of May 9, 2016 (title page) with an initial submittal date of November 2013 and a revision date of September 23, 2014 (page ii). The additional costs include the electricity required to dewater, refrigerate, and ventilate the mine. (Additional ventilation would be required due to the gases exsolving from the geothermal water.) An additional cost unrelated to consumption of electricity would be the cost of replacing mine equipment that is subject to corrosion by the persistent saturated atmosphere. The report by Bloomberg Businessweek (Phillips, 2016) emphasized that the latter is a real concern. According to the report, “Steaming hot water pours off the rocks…It’s like standing in a tropical rainstorm. A digital hydrometer on the wall registers 100 percent humidity” (Phillips, 2016).
"
"CHAP2","Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives","CH2","Chapter 2","Emerman (2018) calculated an additional power requirement of 24 MW solely for the additional mine dewatering and refrigeration that would result from the geothermal water under a best-case scenario. The best-case scenario was based upon the following assumptions:
1)	The flow of geothermal water into the No. 10 shaft has achieved a steady-state.
2)	The aquifer has uniform transmissivity (product of aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity).
3)	The recharge rate of the aquifer does not exceed 0.1 inches per year.
4)	All mine dewatering can be carried out through a single vertical pipe.
5)	The mine can be refrigerated with maximum theoretical efficiency.
The worst-case scenario is a more difficult question, since worst cases tend to be unbounded. Of the five assumptions that led to the best-case estimate, the violation of the second assumption (uniform aquifer transmissivity) would have the greatest consequences. Aquifer thickness can vary somewhat, but hydraulic conductivities of fractured crystalline rock can vary by four orders
 
of magnitude (Charbeneau, 2000). The real worst-case scenario is that, as the underground mine expands, it encounters increasingly fractured rock.
Emerman (2018) estimated the power requirement for the additional mine dewatering and refrigeration under the worst-case scenario simply by multiplying the best-case scenario by a factor of two orders of magnitude to obtain 2400 MW. Another approach is to note that, if the hydraulic conductivity increases by two orders of magnitude, then the entry rate for geothermal water could increase from the 3800 gpm that would occur from expanding the mine with uniform hydraulic conductivity up to 380,000 gpm. At such high flow rates, the head loss becomes very sensitive to the diameter of pipes through which the geothermal water is pumped to the surface. The problem can be avoided by assuming pipes with infinite diameter (zero head loss), which would result in a power requirement under the “minimum” worst-case scenario of 1650 MW (500 MW for dewatering and 1150 MW for refrigeration).
A still earlier study that was funded by Rio Tinto (Bluhm et al., 2013) proposed a design for 140 MW of refrigeration capacity for the Resolution Copper Mine. This refrigeration capacity was intended to be sufficient to accommodate the heat load of 32 MW that would be generated by mobile and static equipment, as well as the heat flow of 30 MW from the broken rock in the underground mine. It is important to note that the heat flow of 30 MW assumed a dry mine and did not take into account the additional heat that would be exhausted from geothermal water entering the mine, which would be proportional to the flow rate of the water. Moreover, the ventilation capacity proposed by Bluhm et al. (2013) was designed to handle only dust and not gases exsolving from geothermal water. The ventilation capacity was expressed as a flow rate (3000 m3/s) without a corresponding power requirement. However, the ventilation power requirement can be estimated using the formula for ideal power consumption for a fan without losses

𝑃  = 𝑞 ∆𝑝	(1)

where P is the power requirement, q is the airflow and Δp is the pressure increase in the fan. Although Bluhm et al. (2013) did not state a design fan pressure, typical underground mines require airflows at pressures of 2-3 kPa, along with more typical airflows of 200-300 m3/s (AusIMM, 2012). Using Eq. (1) with a pressure of 2.5 kPa and airflow of 3000 m3/s results in a ventilation power requirement of 7.5 MW.

Rio Tinto has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Forest Service for an underground copper mine in Arizona, called the Resolution Copper Mine (see Fig. 1). The porphyry copper deposit occurs 5000-7000 feet beneath the surface and has an inferred resource of 1790 million tons with a copper grade of 1.47% and molybdenum grade of 0.037% (Houston et al., 2010; Cherry, 2011; Hehnke et al., 2012). The ore processing rate is predicted to be 120,000 metric tons per day with a maximum processing rate of 150,000 metric tons per day. Process improvements over the anticipated 40-year life of the project could increase the ore processing rate by up to 25%, for a maximum throughput of 187,500 metric tons per day (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c).

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","The U.S. Forest Service has put forward five alternatives for the tailings storage facilities for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine, Arizona, all of which would be designed to withstand the 5000-year earthquake. Four of the alternatives (Peg Leg site, Skunk Camp site, and two at the Near West site) involve the storage of thickened tailings (50-70% solids), while one alternative (Silver King site) involves the storage of filtered tailings (86-89% solids). According to a wide range of dam safety standards, a dam for which the failure would result in the loss of human life should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE), the largest earthquake that is theoretically possible within a particular seismotectonic setting. Using a statistical model based on previous tailings dam failures, the runouts from the failures of the five alternatives would be in the range 200-370 miles. Although the flow potential of filtered tailings is less than that of thickened tailings, even if the failures of the dams for the filtered tailings caused only slumping of the tailings, they would travel at least 10,400 feet from the Silver King site, and would impact the town of Superior (population 2837) at a minimum distance of 2500 feet. The unincorporated area of Queen Valley (population 820) would be impacted by the failures of either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance 19,000 feet) or of the Silver King facility (minimum distance 8.2 miles). The town of Florence (population 26,074) would be impacted by the failures of the Peg Leg facility (minimum distance 10.3 miles), either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance 16.0 miles), or the Silver King facility (minimum distance 20.5 miles). The unincorporated area of Dripping Springs (population 235) would be impacted by the failure of the Skunk Camp facility (minimum distance 17,000 feet). Dripping Springs, Queen Valley and Superior are all well within what has been called the “self-rescue zone” in recent Brazilian legislation. On the above basis, the tailings storage facilities should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake, rather than the 5000-year earthquake that was proposed by Rio Tinto. It is recommended that anyone interested in investing in the Resolution Copper Mine should enquire as to the additional cost of designing for the MCE."
"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","Impacts on Population Centers

All of the local population centers include at least one proposed tailings dam in its watershed, so that the failure of each of the five alternatives has the potential to result in the loss of human life. It has already been shown that the predicted runouts are so large that the ability of a tailings spill to reach a local population center is not a factor. The watershed of Superior includes the Silver King site at a minimum distance of 2500 feet (see Fig. 2). Even a slump of filtered tailings with no added water would nearly cover the entire town of Superior. The unincorporated area of Queen Valley would be impacted by the failures of either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance 19,000 feet) or of the Silver King facility (minimum distance
8.2 miles; see Fig. 2). The town of Florence would be impacted by the failures of the Peg Leg facility (minimum distance 10.3 miles), either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance
16.0 miles), or the Silver King facility (minimum distance 20.5 miles; see Fig. 2). Based on the DEMs, the watershed of Dripping Springs does not include the Skunk Camp facility. However, Dripping Springs sits on the bank of Dripping Springs Wash, which would be quite likely to overflow following a tailings spill from the Skunk Camp site, a minimum distance of 17,000 feet from Dripping Springs (see Fig. 2). It should be noted that, based upon the populations of Superior, Queen Valley, Florence, and Dripping Springs, all of the proposed tailings dams should be placed into the extreme-consequence category (more than 100 persons at risk), using the classification system of the Canadian Dam Association (2013).
Following the failure of the tailings dam at the Córrego do Feijão Mine in Brazil on January 25, 2019, which resulted in 308 people missing or confirmed dead, the new Brazilian mining regulations and legislation introduced the concept of “zonas de autossalvamento,” which are literally the “self-rescue zones” or the zones in which no rescue is possible (Agência Nacional de Mineração [National Mining Agency], 2019; Assembleia Legislativa de Minas Gerais [Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais], 2019). This “self-rescue zone” has been defined as either 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) along the course of the valley or the portion of the valley that can be reached by the tailings flow within 30 minutes, whichever is greater (Assembleia Legislativa de Minas Gerais, 2019). In the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, it is currently illegal to construct a tailings dam where there is a population residing in the “self-rescue zone” (Assembleia Legislativa de Minas Gerais, 2019). It should be noted that the town of Superior and the unincorporated areas of Dripping Springs and Queen Valley are all well within this “self- rescue zone.” Although of course the U.S. Forest Service would not be bound by any legislation passed in Brazil, the proposal for a mining project in Arizona that would be illegal in a developing country should be a cause for pause and reflection.
At this point, it is appropriate to ask how quickly the local population centers could be overrun by mine tailings following the failure of a tailings dam. There have not been many measurements of the velocities of tailings flow slides, but they have ranged from 20-160 km/h (12-100 mph) (Jeyapalan, 1981). (The lower limit of 20 km/h apparently accounts for the equivalence between 10 km and 30 minutes in the Brazilian legislation.) According to Petley (2019), the tailings flow slide following the recent failure of the dam at the Córrego do Feijão Mine accelerated to 120 km/h (75 mph) and then slowed to 66 km/h (41 mph). Using the most conservative value of 12 mph and the above minimum distances between local population centers and tailings storage facilities, the tailings flood would arrive at Superior in 2.4 minutes, at Dripping Springs in 16 minutes, at Queen Valley in 18 minutes, and at Florence in 51.5 minutes.
 
DISCUSSION

It should now be abundantly clear that, due to the probable loss of human life that would result from failure of the tailings dams, the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE), and not the 5000-year earthquake, is the appropriate design criterion for the proposed tailings storage facilities. The only remaining question is the additional cost of construction and operation of the facilities that would be necessary to accommodate the strengthened safety standard. The higher safety standard is not a minor change. Based on calculations presented in Table 3 of Appendix I in Resolution Copper Mining (2014c), at the Near West site, the predicted acceleration that would result from a 10,000-year earthquake is considerably greater (factor of 1.16-1.34 over the range 0.01-10 seconds for periodicity of seismic shaking) than what would result from a 5000- year earthquake (see Fig. 3). In fact, the predicted accelerations show no signs of approaching an asymptotic limit as the earthquake return period is increased from 100 years to 10,000 years (see Fig. 3).
"
"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","The additional costs should be considered in light of the common causes of failures of tailings dams during earthquakes. Most failures are a result of some form of liquefaction of either the foundation, the tailings dam, or the tailings stored behind the dam. Under normal circumstances, although there is water in the pores between the solid particles within the soil, tailings or tailings dam, the particles are touching one another, so that the overlying load is carried by the solid particles (and partially by the water). However, during seismic shaking, the particles can separate, so that they are no longer touching one another, and all of the load is
 
carried by the interstitial water. Since water has no shear strength, the soil or the mass of tailings and water behaves as if it were a liquid. Regardless of the method of dam construction, the foundation could be potentially liquefiable during an earthquake. If that is the case, the foundation might require appropriate compaction prior to dam construction, or the liquefiable foundation material might need to be removed and replaced with more appropriate material, or it might be necessary to choose a different site.
Aside from the foundation, the potential for liquefaction for each alternative, and the cost of preventing liquefaction are a function of the proposed methods of dam construction.
According to SWCA Environmental Consultants (2018), the current plans are for dam construction using the modified centerline method for both alternatives at the Near West site and for the use of the true centerline method at the Peg Leg and Skunk Camp sites. In all cases, the dams would be constructed out of the coarser (sand-sized) fraction of the same tailings that would be confined behind the dam. The important difference is that, in the modified centerline method, the tailings dam is partially underlain by the softer, uncompacted tailings that are confined by the dam (Haile and Brouwer, 1994). The result is that the dam could fall into the liquefied tailings below, even if the dam maintained its own structural integrity. For both types of construction, seismic liquefaction would need to be avoided by maintaining a sufficiently low water table, both within the dam and the tailings pile. This would involve the installation and maintenance of appropriate internal drainage systems. In addition, there would be a need for appropriate operational procedures that would avoid mixing of sands and finer-sized particles (called slimes) within the tailings pile in order to keep the permeability of the sands high enough so that water could escape. Moreover, the rate of addition of new tailings to the facility would have to be sufficiently slow so as to allow enough time for dewatering and consolidation of tailings. Finally, the likelihood of all forms of liquefaction failure could be reduced by decreasing the outward slope of the dam, which requires more construction material. Although the plan is to construct the dam out of the tailings themselves (SWCA Environmental Consultants, 2018), if there were insufficient coarser tailings for this purpose, it would be necessary to purchase or quarry construction material, thus further increasing the cost.
The additional cost of strengthening safety standards also applies to the dam at the Silver King site that would store only filtered tailings, especially considering that, at 1040 feet, this would be the tallest tailings dam ever built by an extra 390 feet. In the matrix of alternatives, SWCA Environmental Consultants (2018) wrote in the category “Tailings Embankment” for the Silver King site, “None. Structural zone of filtered tailings built around perimeter.” This is simply a choice of vocabulary, since a wall of filtered tailings that is intended to confine other filtered tailings still has the same safety function of a dam. Although liquefaction is much less likely for filtered tailings, it is still necessary to prevent slumping of the dam during an earthquake, which would require reducing the outward slope of the structural zone of filtered tailings, thus requiring additional construction material. Moreover, infrastructure is required to prevent the addition of water to the tailings pile, such as appropriate upstream diversions and dams, and this infrastructure must also be able to withstand the MCE (since its failure could result in the failure of the tailings dam).
It is impossible to estimate the additional cost of strengthening safety standards for the proposed tailings storage facilities without further information. In fact, none of the documents that have been made available by Rio Tinto have provided any information about the costs of construction and operation of the proposed tailings storage facilities, even under the weaker safety standard. However, if the Environmental Impact Statement, when it is released, is still
 
calling for design for the 5000-year earthquake, the proposed mining project should and probably will be rejected by the U.S. Forest Service out of hand, without any consideration of costs.

CONCLUSIONS

The conclusions of this report can be summarized as follows:
1)	Using a statistical model based on previous tailings dam failures, the predicted runouts from the failures of the five alternative tailings storage facilities would be in the range 200-370 miles.
2)	Although the flow potential of filtered tailings is less than that of thickened tailings, even if the failures of the dam for the filtered tailings (Silver King site) caused only slumping of the tailings, they would travel at least 10,400 feet, and would impact the town of Superior (population 2837) at a minimum distance of 2500 feet.
3)	The unincorporated area of Queen Valley (population 820) would be impacted by the failures of either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance 19,000 feet) or of the Silver King facility (minimum distance 8.2 miles).
4)	The town of Florence (population 26,074) would be impacted by the failures of the Peg Leg facility (minimum distance 10.3 miles), either of the Near West facilities (minimum distance
16.0 miles), or Silver King facility (minimum distance 20.5 miles).
5)	The unincorporated area of Dripping Springs (population 235) would be impacted by the failure of the Skunk Camp facility (minimum distance 17,000 feet).
6)	Dripping Springs, Queen Valley and Superior are all well within what has been called the “self-rescue zone” (where no rescue is possible) in recent Brazilian legislation.
7)	Since the failure of any the proposed tailings storage facilities would result in the probable loss of human life, the tailings storage facilities should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake, rather than the 5000-year earthquake that was proposed by Rio Tinto.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is recommended that potential investors in the Resolution Copper Mine seek clarification from Rio Tinto on the following questions:
1)	Why has Rio Tinto proposed designing the tailings storage facilities for the 5000-year earthquake, rather than the Maximum Credible Earthquake, even though all proposed sites are clearly upslope from local population centers?
2)	What is the response of Rio Tinto to recent Brazilian legislation that forbids the construction of tailings dams where there is a population residing within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) downslope from the dam?
3)	What would be the additional cost of constructing and operating tailings storage facilities to meet the safety standard of the Maximum Credible Earthquake, as opposed to the 5000-year earthquake?

meant to suggest there is some sort of “iron law” that always causes these social costs to burden communities in the vicinity of active mines or other mineral developments. The actual social costs experienced will depend on a wide variety of characteristics associated with the mine and the socioeconomic environment in which it is embedded. These characteristics vary across the landscapes and communities and, as a result, so do the character and severity of the social costs experienced:

•	The mineral being extracted: Market volatility will partially depend on what minerals are being produced;
•	The geological and environmental setting will partially determine the potential environmental damage associated with the mine;
 
•	The mining and processing methods that will be used will also impact the environmental footprint and legacy;
•	The size of the required workforce relative to the size and density of the existing population in local communities will partially determine the amount of social disruption that is likely to be associated with the operation of the mine;
•	The way in which the mine will schedule its workforce and whether the mine will use a residential facility adjacent to a remote mine for its workers will partially determine the mine’s impact on local communities;
•	The character of the local planning to accommodate the mine while protecting the existing social structure will partially determine the extent to which the operation of the mine will damage local social networks and undermine local quality of life; and the social cohesiveness of the existing communities and the willingness to act to maintain that social capital and trust.

"NP04","NEPA: Legal Questions / FS Authorities","NP","NEPA Process","The objective of this study is to address the following complementary question: Can Rio Tinto profitably operate the proposed Resolution Copper Mine regardless of its impact upon society and the environment? The objective has been addressed by focusing on the following questions:
1)	Are there significant unanticipated costs that were not foreseen in the three-volume General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c)?
2)	Are there significant anticipated costs that were not adequately addressed in the three-volume General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c)?
Although this study has been prepared at the request of the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition, the intended audience is individuals or companies who might wish to invest in the copper project or the companies managing the copper project. For context, Resolution Copper Mining is owned 55% by Resolution Copper, a Rio Tinto subsidiary, and 45% by BHP Copper, a BHP-Billiton subsidiary (Rio Tinto, 2018).
"
"3.2.02","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Geologic Hazards","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","The most significant unanticipated costs thus far have been the costs associated with the unexpected discovery of geothermal water at the location of the proposed underground mine. In 2007 drilling began for the 6943-foot-deep, 28-foot-diameter No. 10 shaft, which was intended for both exploration and as the primary access point for the underground mine (E&MJ, 2014). According to a summary of a presentation by Tom Goodell, general manager – shaft development for Resolution Copper, “Productivity flattened out at 6500 feet. The reason: hot water. ‘In late December [2012], we hit a lot of water,’ Goodell said. ‘We are pumping 460 gpm [gallons per minute]…The consultants told us that we would have little or no water below 4000 feet…They kind of missed that call. We hit it all in one spot and it was quite dramatic.’” (E&MJ, 2014; see Fig. 2). The summary continued, “The other wrinkle is that the water coming out of the ground at shaft bottom is as high as 170°F (77°C)” (E&MJ, 2014). The result of the unexpected discovery was a two-year delay in drilling for the installation of upgraded pumping, refrigeration and ventilation equipment (see Fig. 2). The shaft was completed in 2014 and is now the deepest single-lift shaft in the U.S. (EM&J, 2014; Resolution Copper, 2018c)."
"3.2.02","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Geologic Hazards","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","Based on the unanticipated discovery of geothermal water, the first question regarding significant unanticipated costs can now be subdivided into two questions:
1)	What will be the additional cost of mine dewatering once the underground mine has been completed?
2)	What will be the additional cost of mine refrigeration once the underground mine has been completed?
Both of the above questions were addressed assuming a best-case scenario at every step of the analysis, so that the absolute minimum additional costs were estimated. It should be pointed out that two more additional costs are difficult to estimate and could be quite large. These additional costs are the costs of ventilation, due to gases exsolving from the geothermal water, and the cost of corrosion of mine equipment, due to the persistent saturated atmosphere. The report by Bloomberg Businessweek (Phillips, 2016) emphasized that the latter is a real concern. According to the report, “Steaming hot water pours off the rocks…It’s like standing in a tropical rainstorm. A digital hydrometer on the wall registers 100 percent humidity” (Phillips, 2016).

"3.7.08","Water Resources: Water Modeling Methods and Assumptions","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Results and Discussion

Solving Eq. (7) with input parameters r1 (radius of No. 10 shaft) = 4.267 meters, Q1
(current flow rate into No. 10 shaft) = 0.08833 m3/s, r (approximate radius of underground mine)
= 1400 meters, and i (minimum reasonable recharge rate) = 8.049 × 10-11 m/s, results in projected flow rate of geothermal water into the underground mine Q = 0.2396 m3/s (3798 gpm). Increasing the recharge rate by an order of magnitude to 1 inch per year (8.049 × 10-10 m/s) would increase the flow rate of geothermal water to Q = 0.3092 m3/s (4900 gpm), that is, by only 29%. Using Eq. (10) with Q = 3798 gpm, roughness coefficient C = 100, pipe diameter D = 6 inches, and pipe length L = 6943 feet (2116.226 m) leads to a head loss Δh = 10,014 feet (3052 meters). The use of Eq. (12) with the above values and Δz = 6943 feet results in minimum power required for mine dewatering Pdewater = 12 MW. Applying Eq. (13) with ΔT = 58°C leads to thermal power of the incoming geothermal water Pthermal = 58.18 MW. Using Eq. (14) and TC = 18°C for the reservoir of cold air yields a maximum coefficient of performance COP = 5.02.
Finally, dividing the thermal power by COP = 5.02 results in a minimum refrigeration power of 12 MW (coincidentally equal to the minimum power required for mine dewatering). In summary, under the best-case scenario, the power required for both dewatering and refrigeration of the completed underground mine will be 24 MW. For comparison, the average U.S. household power usage is 1228 W (EIA, 2018), so that the minimum power required for mine dewatering and refrigeration is approximately equal to the total power usage by 20,000 U.S. households.
The best-case scenario resulting in an additional power requirement of 24 MW due to the unexpected encounter with geothermal water can now be reconsidered. That best-case scenario was based on the following assumptions:
1)	The flow of geothermal water into the No. 10 shaft has achieved a steady-state. 2)	The aquifer has uniform transmissivity.
3)	The recharge rate of the aquifer does not exceed 0.1 inches per year.
4)	All mine dewatering can be carried out through a single vertical pipe.
5)	The mine can be refrigerated with maximum theoretical efficiency.
According to common sense, no one would budget for a best-case scenario. It is probably more appropriate to double the cost of the best-case scenario and assume that an extra 48 MW (approximate power usage by 40,000 U.S. households) will be required for mine dewatering and refrigeration. It should be recalled that no attempt has been made to estimate the additional costs of increased ventilation to remove exsolving gases from the geothermal water or the corrosion of mine equipment due to the persistent saturated atmosphere.
The worst-case scenario is a more difficult question, since worst cases tend to be unbounded. Of the five assumptions that led to the best-case estimate, the violation of the second assumption (uniform aquifer transmissivity) would have the greatest consequences. The assumption of uniform transmissivity (product of aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity) is an assumption behind the Thiem Equation (Fetter, 2001). Aquifer thickness can vary somewhat, but hydraulic conductivities of fractured crystalline rock can vary by four orders of magnitude (Charbeneau, 2000). The real worst-case scenario is that, as the underground mine expands, it encounters increasingly fractured rock. If the hydraulic conductivity increases by only two orders of magnitude, then both the dewatering power and the refrigeration power could be multiplied by approximately 100, for a total power requirement closer to 2400 MW.
The original objectives of this study can also now be reconsidered. With regard to the first objective, it could be asked whether the encounter with geothermal water still constitutes an “unanticipated cost.” According to the E&MJ (2014) article, it was certainly unanticipated at the end of 2012. The Arizona Daily Star article confirmed, “Shaft-sinking equipment had reached a depth of about 6,500 feet when water from an underground aquifer began rushing in. The miners were prepared to handle 80 gallons per minute, which is what core samples from 30 feet away predicted…It took a year for workers to figure out how to pump out that much water and install the air-conditioning system that lets humans work in such hot conditions” (Bregel, 2016). It is confusing that the three-volume, 2395-page General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) gives a publication date of May 9, 2016 (title page) with an initial submittal date of November 2013 and a revision date of September 23, 2014 (page ii). However, all of those dates are well after the end of 2012 and nowhere in the 2395 pages is there any mention of the geothermal water and how that will affect the power requirements of the project. Therefore, it could be said that the additional costs associated with geothermal water have not yet moved into the category of “anticipated costs.” It should also be emphasized that the significant difference in the flow rate of geothermal water over a distance of only 30 feet (Bregel, 2016) is consistent with a strong spatial variability in aquifer fracturing, as mentioned above.
The second objective was to consider whether the three-volume General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) adequately addressed all of the anticipated costs. On this basis, it would be tempting to ask how the additional power requirements associated with the encounter with geothermal water compare with the total power requirements of the copper project. It is shocking that the 2395 pages of the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) do not include any estimate of total power requirements or any source of power (besides emergency power) except for the local grid of the Salt River Project. It is difficult to remain objective about this when even a business plan for a one-man
machine shop would estimate power requirements and would assure the bank that an adequate source of power was available. The obvious follow-up questions are:
1)	What are the total power requirements of the Resolution Copper Mine?
2)	How will the consumption of that power affect the other consumers of power from the Salt River Project?
I would be happy to address these questions if they were of interest to the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition or other parties.

"CHAP2","Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives","CH2","Chapter 2","Prediction of Electricity Consumption

Much of the earlier data on electricity consumption by copper mines came only from Chilean mines, which had stricter reporting requirements. For example, based on data from Chilean mines from 2004-2008, Bleiwas (2011) estimated electricity consumption of 460 kilowatt hours per metric ton of copper (kWh/t Cu) for underground mining, 2100 kWh/t Cu for beneficiation, and 144 kWh/t Cu for services (administrative offices, general maintenance, security, and other general support operations), for a total of 2704 kWh/t Cu. Beneficiation referred to the production of concentrate by grinding and flotation, but without further refining by smelting, electro-refining, or LX-SX-EW (heap leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning). The dataset used by Bleiwas (2011) did not distinguish between mining of copper oxide and copper sulfide ores. The above per unit consumption would result in 248 MW for an ore processing rate of 150,000 metric tons per day at a grade of 1.47%. Based on production of ore from a polymetallic body to produce two concentrates (such as the mining of a Cu-Mo ore body to produce concentrates of Cu and Mo), Bleiwas (2011) estimated 51 kWh/t ore for underground mining, and 40 kWh/t ore for beneficiation and tailings disposal for a total of 91 kWt / ore, corresponding to 569 MW for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine. A more recent dataset from Chile used by Fagerström (2015) estimated 655 kWh/t Cu for underground mining, 3075 kWh/t Cu for concentrate production and 188 kWh/t Cu for services, for a total of 3918 kWh/t Cu, which would yield 360 MW for the Resolution Copper Mine. For unit consumption based on ore production without regard to grade, Fagerström (2015) estimated 6.0 kWh/t ore for underground mining and 22.5 kWh/t ore for concentrate production for a total of 28.5 kWh/t ore, corresponding to 178 MW for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine. Finally, based on a global dataset, Northey et al. (2013) found the unit electricity consumption for copper mines that produced only concentrate to be

𝑦  = 15.697 𝑥/0.123	(2)

where y is energy intensity (GJ/t Cu) and x is ore grade (% Cu). Using an ore processing rate of 150,000 metric tons per day at a grade of 1.47% would result in an electricity consumption of 321 MW.
The most reliable estimate is probably that of Koppelaar and Koppelaar (2016), who used the most recent and complete dataset, and who explicitly took depth and grade into account in estimating per unit electricity consumption. Koppelaar and Koppelaar (2016) considered six functional forms, of which the best-fit for mining that including only milling and flotation was

𝐸  = 𝛼 + 𝛾𝐷 + 𝛽/𝐺	(3)

where E is energy consumption to produce a copper concentrate with greater than 30% purity (MJ/kg copper concentrate), D is depth (m), and G is grade (% Cu). Koppelaar and Koppelaar (2016) found a strong correlation (r = 0.66) with the best-fit parameters α = 1.569, γ = 0.00066, and β = 0.0067 for a dataset that combined surface and underground mining, included beneficiation only by milling and flotation, and considered energy consumption only as the
 
consumption of electricity. When surface and underground mining were separated, there were not enough data points to obtain a statistically significant fit that separated electricity from diesel fuel, so that only total energy (diesel + electricity) could be estimated. Applying Eq. (3) to the Resolution Copper Mine with D = 2100 meters, G = 1.47%, and an ore production rate of 150,000 metric tons per day yields 253 MW. Using the same values with the minimum depth of the ore body (D = 1500 m) yields 218 MW. On the above basis, the best estimate for electricity consumption by the Resolution Copper Mine is the average of the estimates for the minimum and maximum depths, or 236 MW.
The additional electricity consumption required to dewater and refrigerate the mine due to the entry of geothermal water should be added to the electrical consumption that was estimated from typical copper mining industry practice. The need to remove and mitigate the impact of geothermal water would not normally be a factor in the power requirements of a typical copper mine. Therefore, the appropriate best estimate for the electricity consumption of the Resolution Copper Mine under the best-case scenario (minimum input of geothermal water) should be 260 MW. The appropriate best estimate for the electricity consumption of the Resolution Copper Mine under the worst-case scenario (maximum input of geothermal water) should be 1900 MW (roundest to the nearest 10 MW).

"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","
There is considerable variation in estimates of water consumption by copper mines, whether the unit water consumption rate is based upon the ore production rate or the copper production rate. Mudd (2008) estimated water consumption rates of 1.27 cubic meters per metric ton of ore (m3/t ore) and 172 m3/t Cu, corresponding to predictions for the Resolution Copper Mine of 56,000 and 112,000 acre-feet of water, respectively. Gunson (2013) built on the work of Mudd (2008) and estimated water consumption rates of 0.59 m3/t ore and 89 m3/t Cu, corresponding to estimates for the Resolution Copper Mine of 26,000 and 58,000 acre-feet of water, respectively. Northey et al. (2013) emphasized the large variation in water consumption among copper mines world-wide and gave 74 m3/t Cu as a global average, corresponding to an estimate for the Resolution Copper Mine of 48,000 acre-feet of water.
The best estimate for the Resolution Copper Mine might come from Singh (2010), who examined only copper mines in Arizona. The advantage of restricting the dataset to Arizona is that it takes into account the high evaporation rates that might not be present at copper mines in the rest of the world. Using the data in Singh (2010) from seven Arizona copper mines (Bagdad, Miami, Mission, Morenci, Ray, Sierrita, Silver Bell) from 2004-2008 resulted in an average water consumption of 28.3 gallons per pound of copper. This average for Arizona would correspond to 154,000 acre-feet per year for the Resolution Copper Mine, which is considerably higher than the estimates based on global datasets. The water consumption rate may be lower for newer mines. According to the Environmental Impact Studies, the projected water consumptions by the Safford Mine (which began full production in 2008) and the Rosemont Mine (which has just been approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) are 7.5 and 7.4 gallons per pound of copper, corresponding to water consumption rates for the Resolution Copper Mine of 41,000 and 40,000 acre-feet of water per year, respectively. Unfortunately, the owners of the Safford Mine, Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold, have not released any actual water consumption data for comparison with the projections (Northey et al., 2019). Taking into account the fact that the water consumption rates for the newer mines are only projections and not actual measurements,
 
the best prediction for water consumption by the Resolution Copper Mine is 50,000 acre-feet per year, which is also quite close to the global average (Northey et al., 2013).
Since the seven Arizona copper mines studied by Singh (2010) are all open-pit mines, it is worth considering whether there should be a difference between water consumption of surface and underground copper mines. None of the previously mentioned water-consumption studies (Mudd, 2008; Gunson, 2013; Northey et al., 2013) separated copper mines into surface and underground. According to Bleiwas (2012), the water required to operate the flotation plant accounts for most of the water use at a copper mine and may outweigh all other uses of water.
The most significant sources of water consumption are the water that is entrained with the tailings that are shipped to the tailings storage facility and the evaporation of water from the surface of the tailings storage facility (Bleiwas, 2012). None of the above relate to the transport of ore from the mine to the beneficiation plant. The only possible exception is that underground mines could use additional water for dust suppression. However, there is virtually no data on this subject (Northey and Haque, 2013). Based on the above, the underground nature of the Resolution Copper Mine was not taken into account in predicting its water consumption.

The predictions of electricity consumption of 260 MW under the best-case scenario and 1900 MW under the worst-case scenario for the Resolution Copper Mine can now be compared with the available sources of electricity. As mentioned earlier, the General Plan of Operations (Rsolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) lists no sources of power besides the local grid of the Salt River Project. For Fiscal Year 2018, the Salt River Project (2019) reported peak power of 7610 MW and peak power capacity of 8801 MW. The above predictions of electricity consumption correspond to 3% and 22% of the peak power capacity of the Salt River Project under the best- case and worst-case scenarios, respectively. For another comparison, the average electricity generation rate in the state of Arizona for November 2018 was 11,196 MW (EIA, 2019a), of which the predicted electricity consumptions under the best-case and worst-case scenarios would be 2.3% and 17%, respectively. Finally, the predicted electricity consumption for the Resolution Copper Mine would be equivalent to the electricity consumed by 219,000 U.S. households under the best-case scenario and 1.6 million U.S. households under the worst-case scenario (EIA, 2019b). There is certainly no mention on the website of the Salt River Project or anywhere else for plans to increase power capacity to accommodate the Resolution Copper Mine.

"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","Comparison of Predictions of Water Consumption by Rio Tinto and this Study

Rio Tinto has predicted average water consumption by the Resolution Copper Mine of 15,700 acre-feet per year with a maximum of 20,000 acre-feet per year (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a), whereas this study has predicted water consumption of 50,000 acre-feet per year. For other comparisons, the water-consumption prediction from Rio Tinto is 10.2% of the average for copper mines in Arizona (Singh, 2010), 32.5% of the global average (Northey et al., 2013), and 38.9% of the predicted water consumption for the just-approved Rosemont Mine in Arizona (Singh, 2010). The only explanation from Rio Tinto for the above discrepancy has been their promise that, “Maximizing water reuse is critical to the Resolution Project from a physical
 
resource and cost perspective. Reuse and reclaim water supplies will be used for mine operations to the greatest extent possible, including water from mine dewatering, tailings dewatering, seepage collection, overflow water from the copper/molybdenum thickeners and tailings thickeners, and concentrate filtrate” (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a).
In opposition to the above quote, the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) describes only the most conventional technologies for water efficiency. The only areas for which specific water losses have been calculated are the water entrained with the copper concentrate (which is shipped off-site for further refining) and the water entrained with the tailings (which are exported to the tailings storage facility). The copper concentrate would have a water content of 9% by mass (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a), which is exactly the average in the copper mining industry (Singh, 2010). The tailings would consist of 85% scavenger tailings and 15% cleaner tailings. During operation, the scavenger tailings line would contain 5300 tons of solids and 2.1 acre-feet of water, or 65% solids by mass in the mixture of tailings and water. The cleaner tailings line would contain 971 tons of solids and 0.71 acre-feet of water for 50% solids in the mixture of tailings and water (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a). The weighted average for the two types of tailings would be 63% solids in the mixture of solid tailings and water. Such solids contents are on the high end for an unthickened or thickened slurry (typically, 20-40%, and up to 60% solids (Klohn Crippen Berger, 2017)) and on the low end for a high-density thickened slurry or paste (typically 60-75% solids). By contrast, the more advanced technology of filtered tailings results in the export of mixtures of tailings and water that are more than 80% solids (Klohn Crippen Berger, 2017).
The water loss from the export of tailings alone can be calculated from the data available in the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c). Given an ore processing rate of 150,000 metric tons of ore per day, an ore grade of 1.47% Cu, and a concentrate grade of 30% Cu, each day of processing will result in 7350 metric tons of concentrate, 121,252.5 metric tons of scavenger tailings and 21,397.5 metric tons of cleaner tailings, where the preceding amounts are solids only. Based upon the above values, the water exported to the tailings storage facility would be 25,600 acre-feet per year (rounded to the nearest 100 acre-feet per year), which is already 10,100 acre-feet per year greater than the average water consumption of 15,700 acre- feet per year that was predicted by Rio Tinto (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a). Of course, it is possible that some of the supernatant water from the tailings storage facility could be pumped back to the ore processing plant after the tailings are allowed to settle. However, the feasibility of this scheme depends upon the location of the tailings storage facility, which has not yet been determined. For example, one of the alternatives for the tailings storage facility (Peg Leg site) is 18 miles from the mining area (USDA, 2018a), while the alternative site that was considered by Rio Tinto for their estimation of water use (Near West site) is only seven miles from the mining area (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a; USDA, 2018b).
"
"3.7.02","Water Resources: Cumulative Impacts of Water Consumption","3.7","Section 3.7 - Water Resources","The primary water source for the Resolution Copper Mine would be the water resources of the Central Arizona Project. According to the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a), “The Non-Indian Agricultural water allocation and the renewable long-term storage credits from the CAP [Central Arizona Project] and the Gila River Water Storage LLC constitute the current water supply portfolio. These renewable water supplies will provide for over 65 percent of Resolution Copper’s water supply needs over the life of the mine.” The
 
General Plan of Operations (2014a) continues, “Acquisition of the balance of the renewable water supply needed for the full projected 40 years of operations… is expected to be an ongoing process that will continue during permitting, construction, and likely into production.” In other words, even using the prediction by Rio Tinto of water consumption of 15,700 acre-feet per year, only 65% of the necessary water access has been secured. Potentially complicating that ongoing process is the likelihood that Lake Mead will soon drop below 1,075 feet, triggering a water shortage declaration, and a reduction of available Colorado River water to CAP by some 320,000 acre-feet per year. Pinal County agricultural water users are predicted to be among the most severely impacted CAP water users when a shortage declaration is announced, requiring them to access ground water to make up for CAP supply cutbacks—and Pinal County happens to be where Rio Tinto plans to also seek groundwater via a number of new wells (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a; Allhands, 2018).
It is possible to consider making up for the shortfall in water availability by taking full advantage of the unanticipated geothermal water. Of course, this geothermal water cannot be relied upon as a solution to the water shortage since there are no guarantees that there will be too little, too much, or just the right amount of geothermal water. Moreover, there is a trade-off between the availability of geothermal water and the need for electricity to pump the water out of the underground mine and to refrigerate the mine. The short-term shortfall could be 34,300 acre- feet of water per year, which is the difference between what was predicted by this study (50,000 acre-feet per year) and what was predicted by Rio Tinto (15,700 acre-feet per year). Assuming no head loss, this rate of entering geothermal water would require 93 MW solely for dewatering and refrigeration. (The power requirement would increase to 126 MW if the mine was dewatered through a 12-inch pipe.) The long-term shortfall could be the need to provide for the entire water consumption of 50,000 acre-feet per year. Assuming no head loss, this rate of entering geothermal water would require 135 MW solely for dewatering and refrigeration, and 233 MW if mine dewatering occurred through a 12-inch pipe.

The conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows:

2)	The predicted water consumption of the Resolution Copper Mine is 50,000 acre-feet per year.
3)	Although Rio Tinto has promised water consumption of only 15,700 acre-feet per year, they are using only conventional technologies for achieving water efficiency.
4)	The export of water in the tailings alone would result in a water consumption of 25,600 acre- feet per year. Although some water could be recycled from the tailings storage facility, the feasibility depends upon its location, which has not yet been determined.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is recommended that potential investors in the Resolution Copper Mine seek clarification from Rio Tinto on the following questions:
1)	Does Rio Tinto have a guarantee from the Salt River Project that they will supply power to the Resolution Copper Mine that is equal to 3% and 22% of their peak power capacity under the respective best-case and worst-case scenarios?
2)	Why does Rio Tinto believe that the water consumption for the Resolution Copper Mine will be 10.2% of the average for copper mines in Arizona, 32.5% of the global average, and 38.9% of the predicted water consumption for the just-approved Rosemont Mine?
3)	Why does Rio Tinto believe that water consumption for the Resolution Copper Mine will be only 15,700 acre-feet per year when the water exported with the tailings alone will be 25,600 acre-feet of water per year, according to their General Plan of Operations?
4)	What alternatives does Rio Tinto have for water supply if they cannot meet their promise to consume only 15,700 acre-feet of water per year?
5)	Even if Rio Tinto can fulfill their promise to consume only 15,700 acre-feet of water per year, how will they secure the shortfall of 35% of necessary water supply, as stated in their General Plan of Operations?

"3.2.01","Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence: Surface Subsidence","3.2","Section 3.2 - Geology, Minerals, and Subsidence","Correct Input Data and Modeling

The actual data that were used in the subsidence modeling are not presented in any documents that have been provided by Rio Tinto. The only information that has been provided are the types of data and, in some cases, statistical summaries of the data, such as the distribution of micro-defect frequencies in each geotechnical domain (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014c).
On that basis, there is no way for anyone not affiliated with Rio Tinto to repeat the subsidence modeling or to carry out his or her own subsidence modeling. It is not even possible to predict
 
the cave angle using the empirical method of Laubscher (2000), which would not require any numerical simulation.
Even the description of the data is inadequate for assessing the validity of the subsidence modeling. The most important information that is missing are the numbers of drill cores and the depths of the drill cores. Clearly, a valid subsidence model requires an adequate number and distribution of samples, which cannot be assessed. The geotechnical properties of the deepest layers (or geotechnical domains) can have a great influence on the extent of the subsidence zone on the surface (see Fig. 3). However, there is no information as to how many or whether any of the drill cores penetrated as deeply as the No. 10 Shaft (the 6943-foot deep primary access shaft).

The only exception to the above-mentioned lack of input data is the map of the geological faults that were used in the subsidence modeling (see Fig. 5). The faults and other zones of weakness should be the primary control on the surface expression of subsidence. In particular, the primary control on the ability of the panel caving to transmit deformation to Apache Leap should be any faults that connect Apache Leap to the surface footprint of the panel caving area. From this perspective, the most important fault is the West Boundary Fault (see Fig. 5). The fault map is difficult to interpret because it does not include any geographical information (see Fig. 5). However, the fault map does include the outline of the 1% Cu shell (footprint of the volume within which the ore has a grade of greater than 1% copper), so that it can be aligned with the geological map from Resolution Copper Mining (2014c) that also includes the 1% Cu shell, as well as the footprint of the mining project area and other geographical information (see Fig. 6).
The superposition of the West Boundary Fault (as mapped in Fig. 5) onto a Google Earth image (a seamless integration of aerial photography and satellite imagery) shows a pronounced surface feature (labeled as a lineament) that is subparallel to the West Boundary Fault and offset from the fault by about 2000 feet (see Figs. 7a-b). The lineament should not strictly be assumed to be a fault, but a fracture trace, that is a linear feature that is visible from aerial photography or satellite imagery (Fetter, 2001). (Lineaments are fracture traces that are longer than 1500 meters.) Lineaments may be surface expressions of deep-seated zones of structural weakness, such as geological faults, but that must be verified by surface or subsurface mapping. However, the nearly-parallel orientations of the West Boundary Fault and the lineament are certainly suggestive that the West Boundary Fault has been incorrectly mapped, and there is no other mapped fault that could be correspond to the lineament (Figs. 5, 7a-b). Unlike the mapped West Boundary Fault, the lineament intersects the caved rock zone (Fig. 4a), so that there is potential for deformation to be transmitted from the caved rock zone to Apache Leap if the lineament is indeed a plane of structural weakness, such as a fault. On this basis, there could have been an underestimation of the extent of the subsidence zone.
Even if all of the input data were adequate, it would be difficult to assess the validity of the subsidence modeling since no details have been provided, except for the names of the consulting companies and their numerical codes. Not even the titles or the lengths of the
 
consulting reports have been provided (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014c). The subsidence modeling was presumably carried out by competent engineers and computer programmers. However, I am very sorry to have to point out that Rio Tinto has a history of claiming that the reports from their consultants said the exact opposite of what they actually said. A particular example was documented by Emerman (2018b), based upon a comparison of a consulting report to Rio Tinto with Rio Tinto’s summary of the report.
Adequate Subsidence Monitoring Program

The General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) does present an extensive program of subsidence monitoring, using a wide variety of instrumentation. However, the primary issue is not Rio Tinto’s ability to document subsidence, but their ability to take appropriate action in response to unanticipated subsidence. A comprehensive database of subsidence caused by block caving reported that unanticipated subsidence has occurred in 20% of block caving projects with most of the anomalies being related to geological faults (Tetra Tech, Inc. and R Squared, Inc., 2006; Woo et al., 2013). The connection between observation and action is based on the explicit assumption that “Subsidence is a slow and gradual process that is predicted, closely monitored, and controlled” (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a) and that “Subsidence is a rather slow and continuous process, and as such there would be time to apply an adaptive monitoring plan if required” (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014c). With regard to the latter quote, note that “monitoring” is not the same concept as “action.”
Blodgett and Kuipers (2002) have documented numerous case studies of block caving projects at which land subsidence was both unanticipated and rapid. For example, at the Henderson Molybdenum Mine in Colorado, “The cave zone appeared on the surface as a steep- walled cavity…Although surface survey data revealed the development of a slight depression over the production area, a surface inspection by geologists three days before breaching resulted in no evidence of impending glory-hole development. Geologic factors such as rock contacts and alteration-zone boundaries had little influence on the location of the initial glory hole [mining excavation that breaches the surface]” (Blodgett and Kuipers, 2002). At the Miami Copper Mine in Arizona, “the average daily rate of subsidence was at least 2.4 feet (Blodgett and Kuipers, 2002). Finally, at the Athens Iron Mine in Michigan, “At 5 am…block 2, which was 250 feet thick, 350 feet wide, and 600 feet long, caved to the surface through 1900 feet of jasper (gossans cap) The mined-out area that collapsed was only one-tenth the thickness of the jasper cap. The cave-in occurred during a shift change and no injuries were reported. Immediate inspection revealed no evidence of inundation by water or sand, no crushing of drifts or workings, and no signs of an air blast” (Blodgett and Kuipers, 2002).
Rio Tinto seems to rely heavily on A Practical Manual on Block Caving (Laubscher, 2000), since this is the only reference on block caving that is cited in the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014c). In fact, the manual has even been posted on the website that reports progress toward completion of the Environmental Impact Statement (USDA Tonto National Forest, 2019b). This same manual repeatedly draws attention to the dangers of both rapid subsidence and rockbursts. Some examples of the discussion of rapid subsidence are “Lateral extension or subsidence caving as it was previously described, occurs when adjacent mining has removed the lateral restraint on the block being caved. This can result in rapid propagation of the cave with limited bulking…There can be a rapid propagation of the cave with massive wedge failures if a well developed relaxation zone has formed ahead of the cave front” (Laubscher, 2000). Some examples of discussion of the related problem of rockbursts are “The
 
potential effects of a block cave on installations located in the peripheries of the block include…shear displacements on faults and shear zones. These could produce rockbursts…Cave mining of deep, hard rock orebodies, involving removal of large volumes of rock, will inevitably lead to the generation of mining-induced seismicity, which may lead to rockbursts…The location of the source of the seismicity and the location of the rockburst damage may or may not be coincident. In the larger magnitude events, the separation of the two locations may be hundreds of meters…Rockbursts have become a major problem on block caving mines in competent rock, where the regional principal stress is > 35 MPa” (Laubscher, 2000).
If subsidence is sufficiently slow (as opposed to the rapid subsidence described above), it may be possible to take appropriate corrective action in terms of the planning for the next steps of panel caving. For example, Rio Tinto has emphasized that they will “start mining at a point far away from Apache Leap. The easement will allow many years to gather technical information to reassess the cave and subsidence angles” (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014c). (The preceding quote seems to be contradicted by Fig. 2, which shows the initiation of panel caving at the western edge of the mining project area, the edge closest to Apache Leap.) However, it is difficult to understand the purpose of the post-mining monitoring, at which point it will no longer be possible to correct the procedures of panel cave mining. This disconnect between observations and subsequent preplanned actions should be regarded as a misuse of the Observational Method, which is used implicitly throughout the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c). The Observational Method was both reviewed and critiqued by Independent Expert Engineering Investigation and Review Panel (2015), who investigated the causes of the 2014 tailings dam failure at the Mount Polley Mine in British Columbia. According to Expert Engineering Investigation and Review Panel (2015), the Observational Method “uses observed performance from instrumentation data for implementing preplanned design features or actions in response.” However, the Observational Method is not simply a license to figure things out later. Expert Engineering Investigation and Review Panel (2015) concluded “the Observational Method is useless without a way to respond to the observations.”

Appropriate Error Bounds on Subsidence Predictions

The predictions of the limits of the caved rock, fractured and continuous subsidence zones contain no uncertainties or error bounds of any kind (see Figs. 4a-b). Presumably, all predictions are simply the best estimates and not the worst-case scenarios. The only exception to the lack of error bounds in subsidence predictions are the predicted maximum depth of the crater above the ore body. According to Rio Tinto, “The depth of the crater has been estimated from numerical simulations and also from experience at other operations. As part of the Second International Caving Study a database of bulking factors was developed to assist in the estimation of bulking from the caving process. Based on this work the average life of mine bulking factor for Resolution Copper is expected to range between 8 and 12 percent. If these values are used to estimate the potential crater depth, the maximum depth is projected to range between 656 and 984 ft in depth. Numerical simulations both completed by Beck Engineering and Itasca Consulting also estimate that the crater depth could have a maximum value ranging from 656 to 984 ft” (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014c). It is surprising that the empirical method and the numerical simulations carried out by two different consulting companies using different numerical methodologies all arrived at the exact same range of depths. However, the above range of depths could be re-expressed as a predicted depth of 820 ± 164 feet. If the
 
uncertainty (164 feet) is assumed to be the standard deviation (although that is not clear from the text), then the coefficient of variation (ratio of standard deviation to mean) of the predicted maximum depth is 20%. In the absence of other information, the same coefficient of variation could be assumed to apply to other aspects of the subsidence predictions.
Based on the uncertainty in the maximum crater depth, the uncertainty in the prediction of the approach of the subsidence zone to Apache Leap can also be assessed. Based on Fig. 4b, the predicted distance from the center of the ore body to the outer limit of the subsidence zone in the direction of Apache Leap is 4650 feet. Assuming a coefficient of variation of 20%, the standard deviation of that prediction is 930 feet. Since the closest approach of the subsidence zone to Apache Leap is 1500 feet (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a,c; USDA Tonto National Forest, 2019a), the distance between the eastern edge of Apache Leap and the center of the ore body is 6150 feet. Then assuming that the population of predictions of the distance of the outer edge of the subsidence zone from the center of the ore body follows a normal distribution with mean equal to 4650 feet and standard deviation equal to 930 feet, the probability that the outer limit of the subsidence zone will extend onto Apache Leap or beyond is 5.3%.
The same logic can be used to estimate the probability that the eastern edge of Apache Leap is actually in the fracture zone of visible cracks and slumps (see Fig. 3). Based on measurements on Fig. 4b, the outer limit of the fracture zone from the center of the ore body is 3650 feet. Continuing the assumption that the coefficient of variation is 20%, the standard deviation of the prediction of the outer limit of the fracture zone is 508 feet. On the above basis, the probability that the outer limit of the fracture zone will extend onto Apache Leap or beyond is 0.03%.

A useful framework for discussing acceptable probabilities for destroying cultural and religious sites is found in the Dam Safety Guidelines of the Canadian Dam Association (2013). These guidelines explicitly include “cultural losses” with the explanation that “social impacts, such as damage to irreplaceable historic and cultural features that cannot be evaluated in economic terms, should be considered on a site-specific basis. Separate assessments should be made of potential damage to sites of cultural and historic value, taking into account the feasibility and practicality of restoration or compensation” (Canadian Dam Association, 2013). The Dam Safety Guidelines then classify dams into five categories, based upon the consequences of dam failure. In terms of cultural losses, a high-consequence dam corresponds to “restoration or compensation in kind highly possible,” a very high-consequence dam corresponds to “restoration or compensation in kind possible but impractical,” and an extreme-consequence dam corresponds to “restoration or compensation in kind impossible” (Canadian Dam Association, 2013). It should be clear that any mining infrastructure, for which the failure would result in the destruction of a landscape feature with profound spiritual significance, should be placed in the strictest category of “extreme consequences.”
Having established that panel caving in the vicinity of an irreplaceable site of cultural and religious significance is an “extreme-consequence” activity, acceptable probabilities for the occurrence of those consequences can be considered. According to Canadian Dam Association (2013), dams whose failures would have either very high or extreme consequences should be designed to withstand 10,000-year events (such as the 10,000-year flood or the 10,000-year earthquake). These events have an annual exceedance probability of 0.01%. On this basis, probabilities that Apache Leap will be within the continuous subsidence zone or the fracture
 
zone of 5.3% and 0.3%, respectively, should be regarded as completely unacceptable risks. Even a dam in the low-consequence category, defined as “no long-term [cultural loss]” should be able to withstand a 100-year event, corresponding to an annual exceedance probability of 1%.

CONCLUSIONS

The conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows:
1)	The predictions of land subsidence due to panel caving at the proposed Resolution Copper Mine cannot be verified because Rio Tinto has provided neither the data, the details of the modeling, nor the reports from the consultants.
2)	The only exception to the lack of data is the map of geological faults, which is inconsistent with the aerial photography and satellite imagery that show a pronounced lineament nearly parallel to and offset by 2000 feet from the mapped West Boundary Fault. This lineament would most likely be the zone of structural weakness that would transmit deformation from the caved rock zone to the sacred escarpment of Apache Leap.
3)	The subsidence monitoring program proposed by Rio Tinto explicitly assumes that subsidence will be slow, predictable and controlled, which is inconsistent with the past history of block caving and authoritative manuals on block caving.
4)	Rio Tinto has provided no error bounds on the predictions of the lateral extent of the subsidence zone.
5)	Based on the range in predictions of the maximum depth of the subsidence crater, the probability that the subsidence zone would reach Apache Leap can be estimated as 5.3%. This probability is about 500 times greater than what would be generally regarded as an unacceptable risk for the loss of irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is recommended that potential investors in the Resolution Copper Mine seek clarification from Rio Tinto on the following questions:
1)	Why has Rio Tinto not provided the reports on subsidence modeling from their consultants?
2)	Why does Rio Tinto not recognize the pronounced lineament that connects Apache Leap with the caved rock zone as a geological fault or zone of structural weakness?
3)	Why does Rio Tinto believe that rapid subsidence and rockbursts cannot occur, in opposition to the block caving manual that they rely upon?
4)	Why has Rio Tinto not provided any error bounds on their predictions of the lateral extent of land subsidence?

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","Rio Tinto has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Forest Service for an underground copper mine in Arizona, called the Resolution Copper Mine (see Fig. 1). The porphyry copper deposit occurs 5000-7000 feet beneath the surface and has an inferred resource of 1790 million tons with a copper grade of 1.47% and molybdenum grade of 0.037% (Houston et al., 2010; Cherry, 2011; Hehnke et al., 2012). The ore processing rate is predicted to be 120,000 metric tons per day with a maximum processing rate of 150,000 metric tons per day. Process improvements over the anticipated 40-year life of the project could increase the ore processing rate by up to 25%, for a maximum throughput of 187,500 metric tons per day (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c).
The proposed mine is located within a mix of federal public land (Tonto National Forest), Arizona state trust land, and private land (Resolution Copper, 2018a). The proposal includes an exchange of 5344 acres of land privately held by Rio Tinto for 2422 acres of the Tonto National Forest (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a). The Arizona Mining Reform Coalition and 15 other organizations have submitted scoping comments to the U.S. Forest Service that describe a wide range of detrimental social and environmental impacts of the proposed copper project (Arizona Mining Reform Coalition et al., 2016). Those social and environmental impacts will not be reviewed or further developed in this study.
As part of the preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the U.S. Forest Service has put forward five alternative plans for the tailings storage facilities for the proposed mine (USDA, 2017a-b). These alternatives have been summarized in five two-page “snapshots” (USDA, 2018a-e) and in a comparative matrix format by SWCA Environmental Consultants (2018). By EIS conventions, Alternative #1 is the “no-action” alternative. Alternative #2, the preferred alternative that was presented in the General Plan of Operations (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a-c) involves storing tailings thickened into a slurry (65% solids for scavenger tailings, 50% solids for cleaner tailings) at the Near West site behind a 520-foot-high tailings dam (see Fig. 2). Alternatives #2 and #3 are nearly spatially coincident at the Near West site, but Alternative #3 extends slightly farther in the northeast direction (see Fig. 2). Alternative #3 involves slightly thicker scavenger tailings (70% solids) and a slightly lower dam (510 feet).
Alternative #4 would involve the storage of filtered tailings (86-89% solids) at the Silver King site to a height of 1040 feet (see Fig. 2, Table 1). The dam for the Silver King site would be a “structural zone” of tailings built around the perimeter (SWCA Consultants, 2018) and would be the tallest tailings dam ever constructed. (The current tallest tailings dam in the world is the 650- foot-high Quillayes Dam at the Los Pelambres Mine in Chile (Campaña et al., 2015)).
Alternative #5 involves the storage of thickened tailings (60% solids for scavenger tailings, 50% solids for cleaner tailings) behind a 310-foot-high tailings dam at the Peg Leg site (see Fig. 2, Table 1). The final Alternative #6 involves the storage of similarly thickened tailings (60% solids for scavenger tailings, 50% solids for cleaner tailings) behind a 490-foot-high tailings dam at the Skunk Camp site (see Fig. 2, Table 1). The total volumes of stored tailings have been predicted as 1315.45 million cubic yards for the sites storing thickened tailings and 1188.98 million cubic yards for the site storing filtered tailings (see Table 1; USDA, 2017b).
The most important aspect of the design of the tailings dam, or any other component of a tailings storage facility, is the choice of the correct safety criteria, one of which is the Maximum Design Earthquake (MDE). According to Rio Tinto, the tailings storage facilities will be designed to withstand an earthquake with a return period of 5000 years, corresponding to an earthquake with an annual exceedance probability of 0.02%, or a 1% probability of exceedance  
in 50 years (Resolution Copper Mining, 2014a,c). That choice of the 5000-year earthquake has never been justified in any document produced by Rio Tinto.

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","Figure 2. Out of the five alternatives for the tailings storage facilities for the proposed Resolution Copper Mine, four would store thickened tailings, while one would store filtered tailings. Two alternatives at the Near West site are nearly spatially coincident, with the alternative with thickest tailings being slightly larger. Failure of the Silver King facility would impact the town of Superior (population 2837). The unincorporated area of Queen Valley (population 820) would be impacted by the failures of the Silver King or either of the Near West facilities. The town of Florence (population 26,074) would be impacted by the failures of the Peg Leg, Silver King, or either of the Near West facilities. The unincorporated area of Dripping Springs (population 235) would be impacted by the failure of the Skunk Camp facility. On the above basis, the tailings storage facilities should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake, rather than the 5000-year earthquake, as proposed by Rio Tinto. Background combines Google Earth imagery from December 6, 2014, January 13, 2018, and April 6, 2018."
"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","The objective of this report is to answer the following question: Is the ability to withstand the 5000-year earthquake the appropriate design criterion for the tailings storage facilities at the proposed Resolution Copper Mine? Based on the discussion above, the question is equivalent to the following: Would the failure of the tailings dams at the Resolution Copper Mine result in the probable loss of at least one human life? Although this study has been prepared at the request of the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition, the intended audience is individuals or companies who might wish to invest in the copper project or the companies managing the copper project. For context, Resolution Copper Mining is owned 55% by Resolution Copper, a Rio Tinto subsidiary, and 45% by BHP Copper, a BHP-Billiton subsidiary (Rio Tinto, 2018). It might be assumed that the possible failure of a tailings dam and the resulting loss of human life are more of a human rights issue than a financial issue. However, for the purpose of this report, it will be assumed that Rio Tinto would not actually construct tailings dams that would endanger human life, so that the issue is whether Rio Tinto, at this point, has correctly taken into account the real cost of constructing and maintaining tailings storage facilities at the appropriate safety level. Previous reports concerning the financial viability of the Resolution Copper Mine include evaluations of the impact of the discovery of geothermal water on the mining project (Emerman, 2018a), the projected electricity and water consumption of the project (Emerman, 2019), and the impact of the land subsidence that would be caused by the project on the sacred lands of the Apache."
"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","Predicted runouts due to failure of the tailings dams at each of the five alternative tailings storage facilities range from 201 miles (Peg Leg site) to 370 miles (Silver King site; see Table 1). Although the predicted runouts may seem surprisingly large, it should be noted that, compared to past tailings dam failures, the impounded volumes and dam heights are “off the charts.” For the Resolution Copper Mine, the impounded volumes are either 1315.45 million cubic yards for thickened tailings or 1188.98 million cubic yards for filtered tailings (USDA, 2019b; see
Table 1). By contrast, the largest volume of impounded tailings at any tailings dam that has failed thus far was 97 million cubic yards at the Mount Polley Mine in British Columbia that failed in 2014 (Larrauri and Lall, 2018). Moreover, the tallest tailings dam that has failed thus far was the 295-foot-high Fundão Dam at the Samarco Mine in Brazil that failed in 2015 (Larrauri and Lall, 2018), which was not as tall as any of the proposed tailings dams for the Resolution Copper Mine (see Table 1). Predicted spill volumes, which depend only upon the impounded volume (see Eq. 2) are either 309.1 million cubic yards for thickened tailings or 280.8 million cubic yards for filtered tailings (see Table 1). Again, by contrast, the largest tailings spill that has occurred thus far was 42 million cubic yards from the failure of the Fundão Dam (Larrauri and Lall, 2018).

"3.10.01","Public Health and Safety: Tailings Storage Facility Design","3.10","Section 3.10 - Public Health and Safety","The important point is that tailings dam failures could have very wide-ranging impacts, extending over hundreds of miles, and that the previously-mentioned local population centers are simply the “front line” of affected populations. It could be argued that the statistical model based upon past tailings dams failures does not apply to the Silver King site, which will store filtered tailings. Based upon their lower water content, filtered tailings will have much less ability to mobilize into a flow slide than more conventional unthickened or thickened tailings. Moreover, none of the data points used by Laurarri and Lall (2018) seem to have involved dams that stored filtered tailings. However, a collapse of filtered tailings could potentially evolve into a flow slide if the tailings mixed with enough water following collapse, and the Silver King site sits on the flow path of King Wash, a tributary of Queen Creek (see Fig. 2). Even in the best-case scenario, a failure of the tailings dam at the Silver King site would result in the slump of the filtered tailings that would extend for a distance of roughly ten times the dam height or 10,400 feet (Klohn Crippen Berger, 2017)."
