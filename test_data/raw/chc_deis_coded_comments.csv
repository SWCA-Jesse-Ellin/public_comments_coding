"VEG02","TES Plant Species","VEG","Vegetation","This is to notify the Cardinal-Hickory Creek Power Line sighting personnel both federal US Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities and engineering SWCA Environmental Consultants of the occurrence of a rare and endangered fern, Asplenium pinnatifidum, on rock out-croppings either in or near the northern hill route proposed for the Cardinal-Hickory power line.
This fern was discovered by botanist Dr. Hugh It is (recently deceased a synopsis of his University of Wisconsin career was printed on the on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal Newspaper December 24, 2016). Discovery of the fern occurred in 1958 and was published in Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences Arts + Letters, Volume 67, 1979. The discovery was re-examined by a knowledgeable person in November 2016 and was identified as still present.
A concern for this powerline is that the same problems of access still present in this wild, private terrain also existed in 1958.  I therefore believe no complete survey has ever been done in northeastern Iowa County for this fern then or since.
I propose that a high tension power line through areas with a rare endangered species is incompatible with rare ecosystems, either through direct distruction of habitat or modification of fragile environment with wide clear cuts near vulnerable habitats."

While I agree that there is no direct evidence that ELF EMF causes Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, the study disregards the epidemiological association between exposures of 4 mGauss or more and leukemia. Please review the three attachments for more detailed information,
G. Shay

The Environmental Impact study considered the effect of extremely low frequency {ELF}
electromagnetic field {EMF} on the health of children. Specifically Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia {ALL}. As of this date there is no significant evidence that ELF EMF has a direct causal
relationship to ALL in children. However, over the last fifty years there has been a multitude of studies which show an epidemiological association to ALL with a chronic exposure to levels above 0.4 microtesla or 4 mGauss. The association showed a relative risk of 1.4 to 2. . The Environmental Impact Study shows the Estimate Peak Level for the C‐HC Transmission line to be 5.7mG at 300 ft.

Attached is a list of studies which evaluated the risks of health concerns. Most do not show a causal relationship between ELF EMF and child hood leukemia, but they express a low concern regarding the risk of cancer and cannot definitively declare that ELF EMF has a zero risk of ALL in children. A few of the studies reaffirm the association between chronic exposure and ELF EMF of 4mG and recommend that studies be continued. Science has great difficulty in proving a negative, but discretion dictates that there should be a 300 ft distance between structures and the midline of a transmission line.

PSC 1992 Ruled against taking human health into consideration. The Commission changed
because they could not say that health hazards did not exist. 

World Health Organization. The panel classified power frequency EMF as possibly carcinogenic based on a fairly consistent association between a doubling of risk of childhood leukemia and magnetic exposure above 0.4 micro Tesla or 4mGauss.

2003 National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences IARC. Exposure to 3‐4 mGauss may
increase the risk of ALL in children. 

2015 European Commission Scientific Committee on energy and identified risks. ELF
showed increase of childhood leukemia with average daily exposure about 3‐4 M Gauss.

USH 14 Corridor (ATC Northern and ATC Southern Routes)
A study was completed in 2010 on the USH 14 corridor from WIS 78 to USH 12/14, Mazomanie to
Middleton. The purpose of the study was to collect and distribute environmental, socio-economic, and transportation data concerning USH 14 between Mazomanie and Middleton. The data is to be used as a source of information for future transportation decisions related to the corridor. A needs analysis that defined existing operational deficiencies and determines future corridor needs was conducted. Effective options to preserve the function of USH 14, increase safety, and identify short, intermediate, and longterm strategies and recommendations that will preserve the corridor in its current configuration for as long as possible were suggested.

The study states that the majority of USH 14 mainline is to be maintained as a two-lane facility. Within the Cardinal-Hickory Line limits, intersection improvements were recommended at Stagecoach Road, Cleveland Road and Rocky Dell. Stagecoach Road intersection improvements occurred recently along with centerline/shoulder rumble strips between Stagecoach Road and Twin Valley Road. An Access Management Plan is also included in the study. This is a long-term vision for the corridor with goals to protect the function of the highway and preserve safety and capacity. Within the Cardinal-Hickory Line limits, potential new roadway intersections, removal of driveway access, road closures and frontage roads are recommended. No projects are currently planned or programmed for design and the prospect of expanding USH 14 on its current alignment seems low.

US 18/151 Corridor (ATC Southern Route)
An Environmental Assessment (EA) study was completed in 2013 on the USH 18/151 corridor from
Dodgeville to Verona. The purpose of the study was to determine a proposed action to improve the level of safety and functionality as defined as a backbone route in WisDOT’s Connections 2030 plan.
Highlights and recommendations include the addition of four new interchanges, seven grade-separated crossings, additional frontage roads and eliminate 70 at-grade crossings. The corridor is divided into six sections (south to north), five of which are within the limits of the Cardinal-Hickory Transmission line project. All sections can be designed and constructed independently of the others or any combination when funding becomes available.

Once this EA study was approved, WisDOT moved into the mapping phase of the corridor. This phase utilizes Wisconsin State Statute 84.295 (10) to officially map the corridor. This statute provides the DOT the authority to purchase Officially Mapped lands as right-of-way and serves as a link between the planning and preservation process and the final project design. The mapping phase is underway, but has been interrupted by a need to revisit the EA study. A development came forth near Barneveld, WI and affected the proposed alternative as defined in the study. This caused the study to re-evaluate the proposed action in this area.

WisDOT Improvement Program, 2017-2022 (ATC and ITC Routes)

USH 18/151 (ATC Southern Routes)
 A new interchange construction project on the west side of Ridgeway at USH 18/151 and County ID was completed in 2018
 Resurfacing project scheduled for 2022 from Dodgeville to Mt. Horeb on USH 18/151
 Pavement replacement/bridge deck overlay in from STH 23 to USH 18
 New County Salt Storage Facility, south of the USH 151/CTH O interchange or along the east
side of USH 151 just north of the STH 23 interchange

USH 18/151 (ATC Southern Route Option)
 Install new cable guard on USH 18 between Lunde Lane and CTH PB.
USH 14 (ATC Northern and Southern Routes)
 Mill & overlay of USH 14 from Cross Plains to Middleton
USH 61 (ITC Northern Routes)
 Mill & overlay of USH 61 from Dickeyville to Lancaster

Of the known projects listed above, the one that will require the most coordination is the new interchange near Ridgeway along USH 18/151 at CTH ID.

The applicants shall recognize that their facilities (structures or overhanging wires) constructed within
WisDOT highway right-of-way may be in conflict with highway reconstruction or expansion projects in the future that are planned or unplanned. If WisDOT determines that any of the applicants’ facilities within the highway right-of-way need to be moved because of such work in the future, the cost of relocating the facilities and planned power outages associated with the relocations will be the responsibility of the applicants"

The applicants should make every effort possible to limit the number of highway crossings. When
crossings are necessary, the large “90-degree” support structures are not preferable. At the same time, long and gradual crossings should be avoided to reduce the length of transmission line overhang. A balance between the two would be preferred. 

WisDOT is willing to consider routing through interchanges. However, it is WisDOT’s policy that overhead utilities be located as near as practical to the ROW line (UAP 09-15-25 3.1)."

The location of the proposed transmission lines next to existing highway structures is important to
consider. There are some areas where future highway expansion is expected and certain highway
structures may require replacement or rehabilitation in the future that is currently unplanned. It is
reasonable to expect that a crane will be needed to work on these structures. The clearance between cranes and overhead transmission lines should be considered when selecting the final alignment and placement of the Cardinal-Hickory Creek line and structures.

"ALT02","Proposed Action","ALT","Alternatives","Clear Zone

According to WisDOT’s Facilities Development Manual (FDM), rigid structures like the applicants’
structures should either be placed outside the clear zone along highways or be shielded from traffic.
Clear zone distances vary due to multiple factors including highway design speed, highway traffic
volumes, and highway side slopes. WisDOT provides guidance on defining these values in its Facilities Development Manual (FDM) Section 11-15, Attachment 1.9- http://wisconsindot.gov/rdwy/fdm/fd-11-15-att.pdf#fd11-15a1.9. It is important to consider somewhat conservative clear zone values to guard against future unknowns. It is also important to consider the possibility of increased clear zone requirements associated with future highway improvements.

Clear zone distances also need to be considered for the work zones that are required for the construction of the transmission line. Though a structure may technically be outside the defined clear zone, the equipment at the construction site required to build the structure may encroach into the clear zone. This equipment, though only a temporary hazard to traffic, needs to be shielded as long as it encroaches into the clear zone. This typically occurs at the structures that are placed just outside the clear zone line. The work zones can be shielded by the installation of a temporary concrete barrier with crash cushions along the paved highway shoulder. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of locations where this is required by adjusting the size of the work zone."

Statement (DEIS) on the Cardinal–Hickory Creek transmission line. I have a PhD in Botany and
50 years of teaching and research experience as an ecologist. From 1998-2016, I held the title of
Aldo Leopold Chair of Restoration Ecology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; I am now
the Aldo Leopold Professor Emerita. My publications include over 260 journal articles and
books on wetland ecology and restoration, including the effects of invasive species on wetlands.
Wetlands might appear to be flat, but what you see on the ground is only a fraction of what
makes up a wetland. These are three-dimensional ecosystems, with a vertical dimension, and
they “don’t take kindly” to disruptions, either above- or belowground.

claim that cluttered airspace has no significant impact, a flight path that looks like open space
can be lethal to birds attempting to fly through “openings.” And birds that try to land in wetlands
can be ensnared by wires that connect towers. Birds that fly in the daytime might be able to
avoid powerlines, but those that fly in dim light are likely more vulnerable. A powerline that
would dissect the Driftless Area on an east-west axis would be hard for north-south migrants to
avoid. Birds that migrate every fall and spring don’t need more obstructions."

We are writing in OPPOSITION to the proposed Cardinal Hickory Creek power line. "
"SOCIO08","Cost/Benefit Outcome","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","The driving force is companies and corporations (in particular ATC), who are pushing this in order to make hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps even billions, at the expense of hundreds of thousands of local residents and their future generations of families and community members. This is an age-old story:  An outside entity, coming in to exploit & extract local resources, upsetting the balance of human & ecological lives - and then walking away with tons of money to put into 5th vacation homes for wealthy owners, CEO’s, and VP’s of large corporations & companies.

"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","We have watched with great angst and nausea as we drove the interstates north and northwest in the past two years because we saw the ruthless way paths were made for the vehicles preparing the transmission lines;  additionally the workers ravaged the trees and vegetation (even through the edge of a tree farm!) and clipped off branches that might interfere with lines in the future.  The horrendous mess to the growth of any grass, bushes, trees, and brush was boldly apparent.  Trees were demolished and left to lay.  This past summer we saw the trees/logs were piled in wedges so assumed something would be done — at least for wood pulp — to make use or recycle that wood.  This fall, the piles remained and they are left to rot.


My biggest objection is the look of the poles:  they are ugly brown and huge.  They carry a minimum of eight cables and they are placed every one-quarter mile; additionally, in some cases they are very close to the road.  They are clearly disrupting the beauty of our state."

My husband and I have been driving an hour each way to our jobs just so we can live where we do, on the lip of the beautiful and vast Wyoming Valley, north of Dodgeville WI. When we bought our home with a few acres, we purchased it WITHOUT huge towers and high voltage transmission lines. We moved here to escape that type of crowded, cluttered environment in the city. We moved to a unique and quite land, abundant with wildlife, forests, bluffs and prairies. We very much want our area to remain as it is. For the 23 years we have lived here we have cared for our forest habitat and the lives it supports. For 20 years we have been working on our prairie restoration, and most recently we have created a hopping, little wetlands habitat. With many many species of frogs, pickerel included. Last summer again a nest of hawks were hatched right at the edge of our woods. A fledgling landed on our deck rail.

"REC03","Historic Trails","REC","Recreation","Please accept this email as my comments on the Draft EIS for the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek powerline. I have been a member of the Ice Age Trail Alliance since 1989 and have been actively volunteering or working on the Ice Age Trail since 1991. I have hiked every existing segment of the Ice Age Trail in southern Wisconsin, including those in Dane County many times. I have also hiked all of the lands that are owned for the Ice Age Trail in Dane County where no trail has yet been constructed. So I know the Ice Age Trail, and the views to be enjoyed from it, very well. The Draft EIS does not adequately address impacts of the proposed powerline on the Ice Age National Scenic Trail (IAT). The impact of the powerline would be worse than ""moderate"" because it would interfere with numerous views of perhaps the most scenic feature of the entire thousand-mile Ice Age Trail--Blue Mounds. Native Americans called them Mu-cha-wa-ku-nin or Smokey Mountains. Today we call them Blue Mounds. Wisconsin’s first scientist, Increase Lapham, wrote that Blue Mounds, “were very important landmarks to guide the traveler in his course through the boundless prairies.” This includes 10,000 years of pedestrian use on the Ancient Trail that existed between the mouth of the Wisconsin River and mouth of the Milwaukee River. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","Blue Mounds remain an inspirational landmark to users of the Ice Age Trail. Like a distant guidepost, Blue Mounds are visible from at least a dozen places on existing and future segments of the Ice Age Trail in Dane, Columbia and Sauk counties. Two of the view points include the ridge above the Village of Cross Plains, 11 miles from Blue Mounds, and from 29 miles away on the Ice Age Trail at Sauk Point in Devils Lake State Park. Farther south, Blue Mounds are visible from part of the Montrose Segment of the Ice Age Trail as well. The map below shows the location of a few of the views of Blue Mounds from the Ice Age Trail. Most if not all of these and other views of Blue Mounds would be tarnished and degraded by the Cardinal-Hickory Creek powerline, if built. The Draft EIS fails to address impacts on most of these individual views of Blue Mounds from the IAT and fails to address the cumulative effect on the overall IAT of so many tarnished IAT views. Given this tremendous impact on the IAT and this shortcoming in the analysis, the Cardinal-Hickory Creek powerline should not be built. Let me know if additional information is needed from me. "

The Sugar River tributary holds a variety of habitat environments for many species of wildlife. The habitats that are very close to section U02 of the proposed route include wooded and wetland areas.

They land in the wetlands and fields along the tributary for water and food along their way to and from their northern summer feeding grounds. Some of them stay and nest here for the entire summer, and many stop over for a day or two on their way up north. Our biggest concern for the wildlife are for the sandhill cranes and eagles. According to the International Crane Foundation, the biggest enemy of the sandhill cranes are high power lines. Their flight takes them directly through the space the power lines occupy. We have a pair of sandhill cranes that nest each year along the Sugar River within 150 feet of the proposed route U02. The young cranes feed in the fields directly beneath where the power lines would run. After watching the bald-headed eagles hunting on our land in this section, we can verify that they use a lot of air space to hover over the land, and we often see them gliding and hovering exactly where the power lines are proposed in section U02."

Some of them stay and nest here for the entire summer, and many stop over for a day or two on their way up north. Our biggest concern for the wildlife are for the sandhill cranes and eagles. According to the International Crane Foundation, the biggest enemy of the sandhill cranes are high power lines. Their flight takes them directly through the space the power lines occupy. We have a pair of sandhill cranes that nest each year along the Sugar River within 150 feet of the proposed route U02. The young cranes feed in the fields directly beneath where the power lines would run. After watching the bald-headed eagles hunting on our land in this section, we can verify that they use a lot of air space to hover over the land, and we often see them gliding and hovering exactly where the power lines are proposed in section U02."

According to the PSC publication distributed at the impact scoping meetings, the 345 kV lines can carry large currents and produce relatively large magnetic fields. According to the table in this publication 500kV lines approx. 300 feet away can produce 1.4 – 3.0 mG, which will add to the magnetic fields already created by our home appliances. The alternate proposed route, U02, will run directly over Domini Road, therefore, we will have to drive directly under the transmission lines every time we go to and from Madison, virtually, every day.

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Financial Impact: We purchased the 35 acre land parcel and future building lot adjacent to section T05 in 2003, not only to enjoy its beauty while living next to it, but also, as an investment. The value of the 35 acre parcel and future building lot was included in our retirement and estate plans. Because of the extreme volatility of the stock market, we decided to put the bulk of our retirement savings into real estate. This land constitutes 28% of the total value of our assets. We are very dependent on the future sale price of the land in order to secure a viable retirement. I would estimate that the value of this real estate parcel will decrease by at least 25% after 345 kV power lines are erected next to it. Therefore, the transmission lines will decrease our land parcel value by at least $100,000. Our cost in the property will most likely be higher than our selling price, if the transmission lines are installed adjacent to the land, therefore, experiencing a loss on the property. Rather than an investment for retirement, it will be a financial loss. Since the proposed route T05 is within direct site of our home, it will decrease the value of our home parcel by at least 10%, or $50,000. Therefore, the transmission lines running along the proposed route T05 would decrease our total retirement asset value by $150,000. Again, since the route runs directly across Hwy J from this parcel, an easement will not be required from us, therefore, we will not be reimbursed for any part of the decrease in our land value. We are within 3 years of retirement, therefore, are very concerned about affording retirement. We cannot afford to retire, and live in this area of Wisconsin, if we incur a decrease of $150,000 in our total savings for retirement. *	How will this concern be addressed in the final Federal EIS?"

The DNA in living cells recognizes electromagnetic fields at very low levels of exposure; and produces a biochemical response. The scientific evidence tells us that our safety standards are inadequate, and that we must protect ourselves from the exposure of EMFs due to power lines, cell phones and the like, or risk the known consequences.

Twelve years ago, we purchased 37 acres of land from my wife’s father to build our dream house to eventually retire in. Following several years of planning, designing, plotting the house site, and lots of hard work, our house was built. In addition to the house, we helped design our driveway which extends one half mile into our property from the adjacent count road. We extended the driveway that distance so we could enjoy the countryside in our backyard and to be removed form the county road, associated over head power lines, and neighboring structures. We also plotted our house to have southern exposure to reap the benefits of the sun’s rays in providing heat and to overlook the wonderful Sugar River. We obviously do not want to look out our windows and see massive transmission towers scarring the natural landscape. Everyone must honestly ask themselves – “Would I want these towers in my back yard”? We are deeply concerned that if this project is approved, our quality of life will be significantly impacted in a negative way.  In addition, the value of our property will be reduced. “How will our concerns be addressed in the Final Federal EIS”?"

The Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club supports using the existing transmission line easements and Mississippi River crossings near Cassville, Wisconsin, for the Cardinal-Hickory Creek project. This is preferable to acquiring and creating a new easement. Although this crosses the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge, there are limited numbers of locations where a transmission line can cross.

This draft report does not reflect how the communities affected and citizenry at large feel about the C-HC project at the present time.

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","PROPERTY VALUES The Draft EIS Chapter 3.12.2.3.5 PROPERTY VALUES concludes that because impacts would likely lessen over time, according to the studies discussed, the impacts would be short term. We believe that property values need to be thought about in the context of those properties that have unique aesthetic and ecological character in the Driftless Region. Common sense tells us that values of these properties in the Driftless Area would be less than they presently are if a massive transmission line goes through or is adjacent to them. People who purchase properties for their aesthetic character are not going to purchase the property if it is near to or has a view of high voltage transmission towers. Therefore a landowner selling a property will not be able to receive the price they hope for if their precious land no longer has a special quality. The property might still sell, but not for the anticipated value. Once a transmission line is constructed, new utility construction may follow in the ROW and that will further decrease property values. Then the decrease in value would be long-term. This should be stated in this chapter. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","VISUAL QUALITY AND AESTHETICS The following statement in 4.13 Visual Quality and Aesthetics presents our greatest fear of allowing the C-HC transmission line to be built through the Driftless Region. This most valuable ecological resource in the Midwest would be changed forever. Neither one of the proposed C-HC routes are on an interstate highway. The high voltage towers and lines would change the rural character of this land that is cherished by so many. Statement in Draft EIS: “Due to the energy projects listed in the cumulative action scenario and similar energy projects also likely to be developed in the region, it is likely that additional electrical infrastructure (transmission and distribution lines and substations) would be built in the future. Standard transmission siting practices state that when siting a new transmission line, efforts should be made to parallel existing linear features. If, at some time in the future, an additional transmission line is proposed within the project areas, it is likely that the current project would be seen as an opportunity site for the construction of additional transmission features. Since characteristics of the landscape have previously changed and will continue to change over time, all action alternatives would contribute to long-term, moderate cumulative impacts to visual resources.” (Bold font is ours) Because of this stated reality other non-transmission alternatives must be used instead of a high voltage transmission line to meet electricity needs in the Driftless Region."
"VEG03","Noxious Weeds/Invasive Species","VEG","Vegetation","INVASIVE SPECIES The report acknowledges and concludes in 4.5 VEGETATION, INCLUDING, WETLANDS AND SPECIAL STATUS PLANTS, “The cumulative impacts of disturbance to vegetation, creation of edges, and use of foreign vehicles or equipment transporting invasive species would contribute to a potential increase in those species.” Our concern is that the C-HC Project will increase invasive species along the routes and inward to other properties no matter what route. We know that invasive species are having a staggering impact on our environment with ecological, economic, aesthetic, health and quality of life consequences. If the high voltage C-HC transmission line is constructed it would contribute to these consequences unless it is diligently timed and monitored by the utilities both in the construction and maintenance of the ROWS. The Council on Forestry’s Best Management Practices is referred to in Table ES-4. Environmental Commitments Common to All Alternatives, Invasive Species. These BMPs are voluntary. A regulatory agency is necessary that will be responsible for monitoring invasive species control and compliance by utilities. It is our understanding that the WDNR is only involved where permits are required and that it is not usually the function of the PSC to regulate vegetation. Vegetation management regulation should be required by the PSC as a condition of approval of a high voltage transmission line. The commitments listed in this Draft EIS must be enforceable and state how they will be enforced. Also, the first commitment states *The Utilities would follow the Wisconsin Council on Forestry’s “Invasive species Best Management Practices: Rights-of-way” guidance to mitigate the spread of invasive species (see Appendix D). This statement should say will follow as stated in other Commitments to All Alternatives. Our experience is that utility companies do not monitor invasive species control effectively. We can site wild parsnip as an example for the need of careful timing and monitoring. It is one of the most prevalent invasive species in the C-HC Project. This is noted in 3.3.1.3.3 INVASIVE SPECIES. If it is mowed when the seeds are ripe it spreads rapidly to adjacent properties. This can be seen throughout Dane and Iowa County where the timing of mowing was not based on the seed production of the wild parsnip. Actually the mowing by local governments is responsible for much of its widespread invasion. It is a health risk to people. Many citizens and tourists do not know the plant and its potential for creating a very uncomfortable rash if it is touched when they are in the sun. Some people have had disabling burns from wild parsnip. We know of two incidents where this happened in the Town of Dodgeville. The danger of invasive species spreading from the transmission line construction comes in the edges between the line and landowner’s property. Although it may be controlled in the ROW, it isn’t along the edge. This creates additional management efforts for the landowner if they are aware and care that it is present. Some owners aren’t aware and this leaves areas for people to unwittingly walk through it and creates new ripples of areas for seed distribution. The Forestry Council’s BMPs show the timing for controlling it and all invasive species. Garlic mustard is another listed invasive species and is a very aggressive spreader in the alternate route areas. It needs to be controlled with rapid response before seed production. Unfortunately Governor Dodge State Park already shows the results of its invasion. Garlic mustard is taking over forestlands and is decreasing the diversity of native plants. The PSC must not leave invasive species management in the ROWs to voluntary efforts by utility companies. The lack of enforcement for vegetation management creates a severe consequence of invasive species spreading in our rural landscape if the C-HC Project would be approved by the PSC. The EIS Draft must address this in its environmental impacts and commitments regarding invasive species."

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","I spoke with Diane Holmes‐Kaub who is a Realtor with ReMax. She is the realtor who assisted my husband and I in the purchase of this home in Deer Run Heights. So, she is familiar with this area in particular. She has been in selling homes in the Madison area for 32 years. She gave me permission to use her name and her words. She told me that there is no question that buyers are reluctant to purchase homes where electric towers are on the property and even just when wires are in sight of the property. Some buyers will absolutely refuse to even consider a home with such conditions. And when home buyers do purchase properties with electric towers, poles or wires, they definitely offer less money for the purchase price. They do this, because knowing their own reluctance; they know that when it is time for them to sell the home, they will run in to the same concern from other buyers. ● There are two main reasons why electric towers, poles and wires affect home values. First is the esthetics. They are just plain unsightly to virtually everyone. The second is that people are concerned about potential dangers of radiation from these wires. While one can cite study after study that presumably shows that there is little to no danger from radiation from these wires, that doesn’t matter if a home buyer believes the radiation to be a problem. So, it may be more a problem of perception than reality, but that doesn’t matter when it comes to the purchase of a home. People will not put their children, or themselves, in a home where they feel they are at risk. And for those who do, they will require a “really good deal” on the purchase price. So again, without question, these towers, poles and wires decrease property values. ● When a person places a home on the market, they are required to disclose “known defects” and anything that is planned that may impact the value of the home. These towers, poles and wires meet that definition. Perhaps even now, but definitely, if and, when a plan for this line becomes certain, I would have to disclose this information when listing my home. The fact that I would be required to list this information is how we truly know that this line would negatively affect home and property values. "

II.ENVIRONMENTAL RULES, Federal EIS process for the proposed CHC: The American Transmission Company (ATC), International Transmission Company, ITC Holdings, and Dairyland Power Cooperative have proposed construction of the Cardinal‐Hickory Creek (CHC) 345 kV hvtl from Dubuque County, Iowa to Middleton, Wisconsin. The proposed CHC project would extend over 100 miles. The proposed CHC is subject to federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) review through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Wisconsin review through the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC). An EIS for the project is directed by the Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act (WEPA), s. 1.11 Wis. Stats., and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Rural Utilities Service Commission (RUS) is serving as the lead federal agency for NEPA review of the CHC. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are cooperating federal agencies for the EIS. The National Park Service is serving as a participating agency. Regardless of the potential financial assistance from RUS to fund Dairyland’s ownership interest in the CHC, a NEPA environmental review is required as part of the permitting actions by USACE, USFWS, and potentially other federal agencies. RUS regulations (7 CFR 1970.5 (b)(3)(iii)) require the Utilities to “develop and document reasonable alternatives that meet their purpose and need while improving environmental outcomes.” NEPA requires agencies to assess the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the alternatives carried forward for detailed analysis. Potential impacts were identified and evaluated for each aspect of the natural and built environments potentially affected by the CHC, including the following resources: geology and soils; vegetation, including wetlands and special status plants; wildlife, including special status species; water resources and quality; air quality; noise; transportation; cultural and historic resources; land use, including agriculture and recreation; visual quality and aesthetics; socioeconomics and environmental justice; public health and safety; and the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. WGF requests the RUS follow all portions of NEPA regarding the proposed CHC. WGF requests the RUS consider these submitted comments concerning the proposed CHC in the final federal EIS. "

Maintenance – brushing, IS introduction. Management – limitation of prescribed burning, IS control and other restoration activities, and open corridors which can increase deer, predators, nest parasitism, and IS introduction. WGF requests the RUS address potential impacts to trout streams and introduction of invasive species, major concerns that should be addressed, in the final federal EIS. Sediment in trout streams is an issue when it covers invertebrate food production areas and trout spawning redds by preventing adequate oxygen exchange. Even a very fine layer of silt can prevent eggs from receiving adequate oxygen for embryo development, potentially decreasing annual recruitment. The most critical times are from early October when spawning begins until mid‐April when the eggs begin to hatch. Invasive plant species cause problems by reducing stream bank plant diversity and decreasing food production of insect species, a valuable food source for fish. They also decrease small mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian species associated with cold water ecosystems. Some of these species are considered state threatened or endangered. There is also the potential to introduce aquatic invasive species by crossing heavy equipment through the many streams and rivers along the lengthy proposed corridor. Species such as the New Zealand mud snail, zebra mussels, Eurasian water milfoil and Myxobolus cerabalis (a parasite fatal to salmonids) have all been known to ""hitchhike"" from one water body to another by inadequate cleaning of boats, waders and other equipment.

Sediment in trout streams is an issue when it covers invertebrate food production areas and trout spawning redds by preventing adequate oxygen exchange. Even a very fine layer of silt can prevent eggs from receiving adequate oxygen for embryo development, potentially decreasing annual recruitment. The most critical times are from early October when spawning begins until mid‐April when the eggs begin to hatch. Invasive plant species cause problems by reducing stream bank plant diversity and decreasing food production of insect species, a valuable food source for fish. They also decrease small mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian species associated with cold water ecosystems. Some of these species are considered state threatened or endangered. There is also the potential to introduce aquatic invasive species by crossing heavy equipment through the many streams and rivers along the lengthy proposed corridor. Species such as the New Zealand mud snail, zebra mussels, Eurasian water milfoil and Myxobolus cerabalis (a parasite fatal to salmonids) have all been known to ""hitchhike"" from one water body to another by inadequate cleaning of boats, waders and other equipment.

PUBLIC TRUST WILDLIFE SPECIES affected by proposed CHC routes: There are numerous endangered, threatened, and special concern wildlife species who inhabit the biodiverse lands of the proposed CHC (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Natural Heritage Inventory working list. https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/nhi/wlist.html ; Wisconsin Wildlife Action Plan: Habitats. Wisconsin of Natural Resources. https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/nh/nh0983_4_0‐3.pdf). RUS, in consultation with USFWS, identified eight wildlife species that are federally listed as threatened or endangered that may occur in the CHC area: whooping crane, northern long‐eared bat, rusty patched bumble bee, Hine’s emerald dragonfly, Iowa Pleistocene snail, Higgin’s eye pearly mussel, sheepnose mussel, and spectacle case mussel. It was determined that 117 special status species have been: 1) previously documented, 2) are likely present, or 3) are not known to occur, but for which suitable habitat is present within the CHC resource evaluation area (Table 3.4‐1. Special Status Species Considered Potentially Present within C‐HC Project Resource Evaluation Area as Determined through Coordination with USFWS, IDNR, and WDNR pp 214‐217 https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CHC_DEIS_Vol_I_Web_508_111918.pdf ). Within the proposed CHC corridor, all potential areas where these federal and state listed species can occur need to be evaluated for potential adverse impacts. WGF requests the RUS address these potential impacts to the wildlife species in the final federal EIS. Pollinators and other insects: 11 bumblebee species including the federally Endangered rusty‐patched bumble bee; State Endangered regal fritillary butterfly, Ottoe skipper, and Silphium borer moth; State Endangered Attenuipyga vanduzeei leafhopper, red‐tailed prairie leafhopper; and State Threatened Issid planthopper. Fish: 4 State Endangered species including bluntnose and crystal darters, goldeye, and pallid shiner; 6 State Threatened species recorded within 2 miles of the proposed CHC including black buffalo, blue sucker, Ozark minnow, paddlefish, river redhorse, and shoal chub. Other aquatic species: 3 State Endangered mussel species including butterfly, Higgin’s‐eye, and yellow and slough sandshell; and 5 State Threatened mussel species recorded within 2 miles of the proposed CHC including ellipse, fawnsfoot, monkeyface, rock pocketbook, and wartyback. Amphibians: State Endangered Blanchard’s cricket frog, and Species of Special Concern pickerel frog. Reptiles: State Endangered box turtle, Species of Special Concern with protected status Blanding’s turtle, and all the following Species of Special Concern snakes: timber rattlesnake, North American blue‐racer, black ratsnake, bull (gopher) snake, and plains garter snake. Mammals: State Endangered northern long‐eared bat, State Threatened eastern pipistrelle, big brown and little brown bats, and Species of Special Concern Franklin's ground squirrel, prairie and woodland voles. The American badger is a Wisconsin non‐game protected species and an iconic mammal of the Driftless Area, which may experience population effects due to habitat disruption and degradation. Birds depend on lands in the proposed CHC routes during winter, migration, and nesting seasons. The proposed CHC would likely affect important bird nesting habitat. Confirmed bird nesting species: State Endangered loggerhead shrike; State Threatened Henslow’ sparrow, Acadian flycatcher, cerulean warbler, and hooded warbler; Species of Special Concern grasshopper, lark, and vesper sparrows, bobolink, dickcissel, eastern meadowlark, upland sandpiper, Northern bobwhite, eastern whip‐poorwill, common nighthawk, Bell’s vireo , red‐headed woodpecker, prothonotary warbler, and American woodcock. Federally protected bald eagles had over 40 confirmed nests in 2018 along the proposed CHC routes. These confirmed nesting data are part of the long‐term Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas Survey II (Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas II. Season 4 preliminary results and trends. https://ebird.org/atlaswi/news/season‐4‐preliminary‐results‐and‐stats ). Data are collected by trained observers and entered into a world‐wide database (eBird Status and Trends. https://ebird.org/science ). These data are significant, and should be considered when making decisions about important nesting habitat for vulnerable bird species in the Driftless Area. Whooping cranes in Wisconsin are part of the Nonessential Experimental Population (Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership [WCEP] 2018, Federal Register USFWS 2001). Whooping cranes have been confirmed in 2018 in northeast Iowa, western Wisconsin, and central Wisconsin using wetland stopover habitat (WCEP 2018).

"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","VI. AVIAN AND BAT impacts from the proposed CHC routes: Birds are critically important, as they provide key ecosystem services through pollination, and insect and weed‐seed control for the agribusiness and forest products industries. Over the past 40 years grassland bird populations have been steadily declining in Wisconsin, resulting in many being listed as state Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Almost all are classified as such because habitat suitable for their survival has decreased, been degraded, or fragmented below their tolerance and ability to adapt and sustain viable populations (Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas II. https://wsobirds.org/images/atlas/SSS_Threatened_Grassland_Birds.pdf ). Creating and maintaining habitat for grassland birds is imperative to their survival. The Bird Conservation Area (BCA), within the SWSGCA, was created to maintain sustainable breeding populations of grassland birds. The BCA concept is backed by research that suggests viable bird populations require conservation efforts on a large, landscape level. The present BCA encompasses a block of more than 10,000 acres of public and private lands (South West Wisconsin Grassland and Stream Conservation Area. Bird Conservation Area, description and map. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/grasslands/swgrassland.html ). The entire BCA, and the birds who depend on this habitat in the Driftless Area, would likely be affected by the proposed CHC due to habitat reduction, degradation, or fragmentation. Winter is an extreme survival period for birds. The National Audubon Society has sponsored Christmas Bird Counts (CBC) across North America for over 100 years. CBCs are the longest running citizen science survey in the world, and provide critical data on winter bird populations (Christmas Bird Count, Wisconsin Society of Ornithology. https://wsobirds.org/christmas‐bird‐count ). The entire Mount Horeb Area CBC is within the proposed CHC routes. A data set of expert winter bird observations has an average of 56 winter bird species recorded annually since the year 2000, and reveals the crucial nature of quality winter habitat for birds in this area. Nine different raptor species, including federally protected golden and bald eagles, State Threatened red‐shouldered hawks, Species of Special Concern red‐headed woodpeckers and short‐eared owls have been counted during winter in this area. A recent study found that southwest Wisconsin forests have warmer microclimates that help songbirds survive winter weather. Fragmented forests are less effective at dampening climate extremes, and increase bird mortality (Forest ‘islands’ offer refuge to wintering birds. University of Wisconsin News. February 2017. TYRRELL, K. WEBPAGE https://news.wisc.edu/forest‐islands‐offer‐refuge‐to‐winteringbirds/ ). The proposed CHC would create forest and other habitat fragmentation, weaken existing microclimates, and threaten winter bird survival. Data, including the 28 year continuous Mount Horeb Area CBC winter bird data set, should be considered when making decisions that would impact vital winter habitat from the proposed CHC. The EIS should include a robust evaluation of habitat fragmentation and its effects. "
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","Mortality events would likely occur to all wildlife species along the proposed CHC routes. Low frequency electrical transmission lines at high voltage have been proven to impact flying insects (Wyszkowska, J. et al. 2018. Exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields alters the behavior, physiology and stress protein levels of desert locusts. Scientific Reports 6:36413). Impacts from high voltage transmission lines to pollinators can include interference with navigational mechanisms of monarch butterflies, especially from the influence of the magnetic fields (Reppert, S.M. et al. 2010. Navigational Mechanisms of Migrating Monarch Butterflies. Trends Neurosci. 2010 Sep; 33(9): 399–406). The CHC proposed routes are in the migratory pathway of monarch butterflies. Estimated impacts to birds from powerline collisions may number from 8 to 57 million bird deaths annually based on recent sensitivity analysis and a meta‐review of studies (Loss S.R. et al. 2014. Refining estimates of bird collision and electrocution mortality at power lines in the United States. PLoS One 9(7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101565 ). The Avian PowerLine Interaction Committee (APLIC) has developed several guidance documents that contain conservation measures for reducing impacts to bird and bat populations (Avian PowerLine Interaction Committee. Webpage https://www.aplic.org/ ). Bat and bird mortality from the proposed CHC routes would undoubtedly occur. The final federal EIS should address avian mortality. If the CHC were constructed, it should be required to employ robust conservation measures to reduce impacts to bird and bat populations."
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife"," The final federal EIS needs to consider impacts to bat populations, especially in light of recent deleterious impacts to cave‐dwelling bats from the fungal disease White Nose Syndrome (WNS; Pseudogymnoascus destructans). To date, WNS is conservatively estimated to have killed more than seven million hibernating bats in 25 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Bat population declines of >80 % in the northeastern U. S. have recently been reported (Reynolds, H.T. et al. 2015. Modeling the environmental growth of Pseudogymnoascus destructans and its impact on the white‐nose syndrome epidemic. J Wildl Disease Vol. 51, No. 2, pp. 318‐331.). WNS is present in cave dwelling bats in Wisconsin (White Nose Syndrome. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. https://dnr.wi.gov/news/Weekly/Article/?id=4254 ). A bat hibernation cave approximately 0.3 miles from the proposed CHC route is monitored by the DNR for WNS (Stanfield, J.D. personal observation 8 Dec 2018. in: To PSC of Wisconsin – Scoping Input to EIS for Docket 5‐CE‐146. Application for building the Cardinal‐Hickory Creek (CHC) High Voltage Transmission Line (HVTL)). All efforts to protect bats and reverse population declines are critically important. Any efforts to reduce or eliminate additional compensatory and/or additive mortality should be employed. The proposed CHC routes would likely increase bat mortality. "
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","In addition to direct impacts, birds, bats, and other species are impacted by the indirect effects of transmission and distribution lines. The proposed CHC would likely increase these indirect mortality effects for all species. The final federal EIS should acknowledge and address indirect mortality. These indirect effects include the introduction of barriers to movement, habitat fragmentation, site avoidance or abandonment, disturbance, loss of population vigor, behavioral modification, creation of suboptimal or marginal habitats, loss of refugia, and intraspecific and interspecific competition for resources. Most of these indirect effects are difficult to quantify, difficult to separate from other impacts, and for the most part have not been quantitatively tested, critically reviewed, and published in refereed journals (Manville, A.M.

This trend is expected to continue as land use improves groundwater infiltration, increasing base flows and decreasing water temperatures. Coupled with aggressive trout habitat restoration efforts and wild trout stocking, the area has seen a tremendous increase in self‐sustaining populations of both brook and brown trout species that draw anglers from all parts of the globe. A substantial amount of stream restoration work has been completed due to the efforts and funding of many partner groups.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","VIII. NEED for the proposed CHC: Wisconsin law states that a reasonable need for additional electricity must be established before a transmission project can be sited and built. If that need is established, Wisconsin law then requires that it be met with energy conservation and efficiency methods first, followed by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar (Wis. Stat. 196.491 (3)(d) and Wis. Stat. 1.12(4)). The purpose of an EIS is to identify potential environmental impacts, including cost, need, and other economic impacts. An EIS examines whether a project is in the public interest, and examines potential impacts to the land, flora, fauna, and water resources. It also evaluates if there are viable alternatives (WEPA/NEPA Code of Federal Regulations s.1506.1). WGF requests that the RUS examine the need for the CHC using relevant cost/benefit analysis and studies that clearly lay out this need rather than relying on general statements in the CHC application (https://psc.wi.gov/Pages/MajorCases/CardinalHickoryCreek.aspx ). Ten year U.S. Energy Information Administration and Wisconsin PSC records show that Wisconsin electricity use has increased 0.1% per year while demand has dropped 0.4% per year (EIA Form 861 https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/ Table 4. Assessment of Electric Demand and Supply Conditions, Monthly Non‐Coincident Peak Demands, MW, WI PSC Strategic Energy Assessment 2024). This trend is the result of increasing use of non‐transmission alternatives, which cost far less than capital utility additions, and are twice as effective at reducing CO2. The Department of Energy recently determined that 50% of electricity generation associated CO2 reduction realized since 2005 resulted from non‐transmission alternatives (https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37392 ). EIS INVESTIGATION REQUEST: WGF requests that the RUS consider the need for the project and consider non‐transmission alternatives. Cost and environmentally effective non‐transmission alternatives include pole replacements, targeted load management, energy efficiency rebates to affected areas, and adding community solar to prolong the lifespan of transformers and conductors where possible. WGF also requests that the RUS compare CO2 emission impacts, comprehensive energy savings, comprehensive demand savings, costs from avoided or added natural gas generation and savings from avoided distribution/transmission infrastructure for the applicants’ non‐transmission alternative and the high voltage transmission project over 40 years. IX. Conclusion: The proposed Cardinal‐Hickory Creek high voltage transmission line has many potential impacts to the lands, waters, species, and quality of life in the Driftless Area. Wisconsin’s Green Fire: Voices for Conservation requests that the US fully investigate and report on all aspects of the proposed CHC, evaluate non‐transmission alternatives, and recommend actions which best serve the needs of Wisconsin citizens into the future.

"DECI10","State Laws, Policies","DECI","Decision Process","VIII. NEED for the proposed CHC: Wisconsin law states that a reasonable need for additional electricity must be established before a transmission project can be sited and built. If that need is established, Wisconsin law then requires that it be met with energy conservation and efficiency methods first, followed by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar (Wis. Stat. 196.491 (3)(d) and Wis. Stat. 1.12(4)). The purpose of an EIS is to identify potential environmental impacts, including cost, need, and other economic impacts. An EIS examines whether a project is in the public interest, and examines potential impacts to the land, flora, fauna, and water resources. It also evaluates if there are viable alternatives (WEPA/NEPA Code of Federal Regulations s.1506.1). WGF requests that the RUS examine the need for the CHC using relevant cost/benefit analysis and studies that clearly lay out this need rather than relying on general statements in the CHC application (https://psc.wi.gov/Pages/MajorCases/CardinalHickoryCreek.aspx ).

There is a life span to these wind turbines and we may not be looking far enough in the future as to when the lifespan is done with the turbines, are they being replaced? Fixed? New ones put up? Who is responsible for the cleanup and removal of the turbines?? What does it mean for the transmission line that we failed to prevent?? Was it not necessary to build in the first place?? 
A paper published by The American Experiment by Mitchell Rolling in 2018 reads the assumed lifespan of wind turbines to be at 30 years. In Iowa, MidAmerican Energy plans to repower turbines constructed in 2004-only 14 years after they were installed. That's less than½ the lifespan. Because reports only look at a 30 year window, they fail to account for the cost necessary to repower a wind turbine. By not factoring this additional spending, these reports underestimate the true cost of wind energy and overestimate the cost of power plants capable of generating electricity for more than 30 years. As the urbines grow older, utilization rates become worse, dropping at a rate of 1.6 % each year and that is what requires the turbine to be re powered. A paper written by Rick Kelley of the Valley Morning Star titled Retiring worn-out wind turbines could cost billions that nobody has estimates the tear down cost of a single modern turbine is at $200,000. With more than 50,000 wind turbines in the U.S. decommissioning costs are around $10 billion. This short lifespan is rarely discussed but yet it has massive impacts on the cost of electricity for families and businesses that don't want the transmission lines or to look at the ugly wind turbines.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","Other than to profit ATC and to draw some another line for MISO's grand diagram, the CHC line is not needed. 
ATC erroneously declares that the line is needed for three reasons: 
1.To reduce electric costs.
2, To promote reliability.
3.To promote renewable energy.
Each is a fallacious statement. In order, 
1.	ATC has built 6 High Voltage Power Lines (HVPL's) in Wisconsin in the past seven years. Electricity bills have stabilized because the energy portion of the bill has decreased with less expensive natural gas and renewables, not more power lines. In fact, the cost of power lines has increased the fixed cost.
portion of consumer bills, and CHC would only add to that.
2.	Wisconsin is well known for its electrical grid reliability. The state already has some of the highest electrical transmission reliability in the nation. We don't need more reliability for reliability's sake.
3.	a. Renewable energy growth is hampered by inter-city high voltage power lines. HVPL's originate
and terminate near very large fossil fuel plants. By building these lines, one is in effect
""institutionalizing"" the fossil fuel power plants. Once the HVLP line is built, it will be incumbent upon the utilities to continue to operate the fossil fuel plants, not to decentralize their power generation to
local (' distributed"") renewable sources.
3.b. The vast majority of the electricity now carried by HVLP's is derived from fossil fuels.
Importantly, all of the electricity required by SW Wisconsin is now carried on smaller voltage lines. There is plenty of capacity (by ATC's own engineers' admission) in existing lines and that is projected out ten years. ATC has said that it can put up a HPVL line in three years. There is obviously no urgency for erecting this boondoggle tower project. Even the developers of the proposed 300 MW solar farm 
near Montfort have said that they do not need more transmission capacity than that which presently 
exists. The greater grid also has multiple routes for electrical transmission. 
To clarify this point: more or larger lines won't carry more electricity because lines only carry the 
electricity necessary to meet the demand. It's rather like a water line. If the demand isn't using the 
available water, the pipe won't carry more water if it doesn't have a place to go. Many people just don't understand this point. More HVPL capacity will not carry more electricity than is demanded in the grid. The grid has plenty of current (and projected future) capacity. A CHC HVPL will not carry more 
renewable energy. It just won't.

The Energy Planning Committee I serve on been utilizing FERC Order 890 for the last five years and
participating in American Transmission Company’s (ATC) annual, 10 Year Transmission Planning
Assessment process. http://bit.ly/ATC_Link_01
Every year, over the course of four meetings, a range of stakeholders including Wisconsin utilities,
state PSC staffs, MISO staff, industrial, commercial, residential, environmental and government user
groups review the company’s planning assumptions, drivers and proposed capital transmission projects
culminating in a list of upgrades and new projects within a 10 year planning horizon.
The economic, reliability and environmental “drivers” for the Cardinal Hickory Creek proposal, thus
far, are grounded largely in 2008-2010 assumptions. The most recent data in the AES, the truncated,
“Triennial” MTEP14, is three years old. The MVP-generalized planning assumes a “Business as
Usual” energy growth rate 5 times larger than MISO now assumes. It is crucial to understand and to
document in the EIS that a future 1.06% growth rate is absolutely required for ATC/ITC/DPC to
produce razor thin potential economic benefits from CHC. There is no evidence of reliability need as
demonstrated in the lack of a Low Voltage Transmission option as required by Wisconsin law.
This letter provides very recent, contrasting forecasts that American Transmission Company ATC
made publicly available on February 21, 2107 in the company’s “10 Year Planning Assessment”materials. The data in these materials reflect declining energy and peak growth rates in Wisconsin,
problematic uncertainties with capital expansion based planning, and sharp cuts in the amount of
power Wisconsin utilities expect to import using interstate transmission in coming years. .
(1) See Page 5 of the “Preliminary Need Assessment” at: http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_Pg5
Due to a ""high bias” condition when the uncertainty of modeling fails to capture crucial
regularities, the company indicates that no, new construction transmission projects will be
proposed in 2017.
The uncertainty planners face can be seen when numerical rates are added to this chart on page 7:
http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_Pg7 as below. Utilities and ATC are struggling to accept the historical
changes in use that are taking place. Note that ATC predicts no change in load forecasts from to
2015 to 2016 and in the following assessment assumes a very significant 1 year decline in peak
load of 3%. An annual change of this scale has not occurred in more than 15 years, but ATC is
forced to make this single year adjustment using utility-biased, planning methodology not designed
to control costs but to justify capital utility investment in transmission.
(2) See page 6 of the “Preliminary Need Assessment” at: http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_pg6
This is not new. The company’s demand forecasts over the last 10 years have been considerably
higher than materialized. The sequence of 2014 (purple), 2015 (pink) and 2016 (green) forecasts in
the chart portray the company’s delayed accommodation to the historical change in electricity use
attributed in large part to increasing energy efficiency and the decoupling of economic growth and
energy use. Past and current exaggerated load forecasts become apparent when compared to
conventional, statistical trend analysis. Using the industry standard of looking back ten years,
actual plots from 2005-2015 predict a decline of -.3%/per year in coming years. Below is an
annotated forecast chart showing two conventionally computed statistical trend lines from data
ATC forecasts published in spring 2016. (3) See page 10 of the “Preliminary Need Assessment” at: : http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_Pg10
ATC collects and incorporates use projections from the Wisconsin utilities it serves in its 10 year
assessment process. February 21, 2017 planning documentation shows that WI utilities predict a
very sharp decline in anticipated use of interstate transmission in coming years.
Data from page 10 materials has been placed into chart that is provided on the following page.
In 2016 utilities reported an approximate 28% “Reduction in west to east flows through the entire
ATC system” compared to estimates made only one year earlier.
Excluding the 5 year window which is mostly out of the time frame for Cardinal Hickory Creek, WI
utilities projected need to import power west of Wisconsin during higher volume summer months
dropped a whopping 55% in a single year.
There was considerable discussion about this development at the meeting with some of the utilities
noting they had recently decided to not renew “certain contracts” and observations about more
renewable energy development occurring within state. The decline in interstate transmission use dates at least to 2007 as shown on page 9 of the 2014
assessment: http://bit.ly/ATC_2007-2013_9_percent
Note that company reports that imported power in 2013 made up less than 10% of the power sold
by Wisconsin utilities. Import hours for the Western Interface rose a striking 12% from 2013 to
2014 but ATC's contribution to WI electric sales rose only a few percent points. See:
http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_2014_pg9
ATC has not provided percentages for 2015 and 2016 but we note that low and decreasing use of the
electricity market is consistent with national trends as shown in sales records at the MISO Hub in
Indiana provided by EIA: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesale/
(4) See page 11 description of the protocol ATC follows when determining capital replacement of an
existing transmission asset. http://bit.ly/ATC_Econ_Pg11 Although requested by stakeholders,
ATC has yet to update this protocol consistent with FERC Order 1000 including examination of
Non-Transmission Alternatives to prolong the lifespan of aging transmission facilities. These
alternatives are highly cost effective under flat and declining energy use.
As noted in prior EIS comments, the practice of using joint utility/community-supported solar
facilities next to substations to remove demand on aging, costly transformers is already being
developed by Dairyland Power Cooperative.
(5) On page 21, note that declining use has lead to the cancellation of three transmission upgrades that
were justified as necessary in an earlier planning exercise:
http://bit.ly/ATC_Econ_Pg21
(6) See Page 9 of the Economic Planning materials: http://bit.ly/ATC_Econ_Pg9
ATC presents selected drivers from MISO’s most recent planning (MTEP17) for partial adoption.
Of special interest is the footnote linking to energy use refinement for WI:
http://bit.ly/MISO_MTEP17_Zone2_Detail
Like ATC, MISO collects and assesses future projections made by “LBA’s” including Wisconsin
utilities. In contrast, MISO’s resulting forecast for Wisconsin energy use and peak demand predict
a growth of .2% per year through 2026 for the Business as Usual or “Existing Fleet” future. Note
that MISO’s rate is less than half of ATC’s current projection of .48% per year. This is not
insignificant. MISO is predicting WI utilities will sell 3,000,000 MWh less power over the next 10
years.
(7) Assumed energy growth is a key factor in enabling potential benefits from transmission
expansion. Over 30 years, the difference in the “Business as Usual” energy growth rate CHC
applicants cite in the AES (1.06% per year) and what MISO is currently predicting (.2% per year)
amounts to an additional 5 years of 2016 Wisconsin electricity consumed over the next 30 years.
See applicants’ citation in AES: http://bit.ly/MISO_MTEP14_EnergyPredict The associated data is
compiled into the following chart showing 30 year growth rates plotted to scale.

problematic uncertainties with capital expansion based planning, and sharp cuts in the amount of
power Wisconsin utilities expect to import using interstate transmission in coming years. .
(1) See Page 5 of the “Preliminary Need Assessment” at: http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_Pg5
Due to a ""high bias” condition when the uncertainty of modeling fails to capture crucial
regularities, the company indicates that no, new construction transmission projects will be
proposed in 2017.
The uncertainty planners face can be seen when numerical rates are added to this chart on page 7:
http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_Pg7 as below. Utilities and ATC are struggling to accept the historical
changes in use that are taking place. Note that ATC predicts no change in load forecasts from to
2015 to 2016 and in the following assessment assumes a very significant 1 year decline in peak
load of 3%. An annual change of this scale has not occurred in more than 15 years, but ATC is
forced to make this single year adjustment using utility-biased, planning methodology not designed
to control costs but to justify capital utility investment in transmission.
(2) See page 6 of the “Preliminary Need Assessment” at: http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_pg6
This is not new. The company’s demand forecasts over the last 10 years have been considerably
higher than materialized. The sequence of 2014 (purple), 2015 (pink) and 2016 (green) forecasts in
the chart portray the company’s delayed accommodation to the historical change in electricity use
attributed in large part to increasing energy efficiency and the decoupling of economic growth and
energy use. Past and current exaggerated load forecasts become apparent when compared to
conventional, statistical trend analysis. Using the industry standard of looking back ten years,
actual plots from 2005-2015 predict a decline of -.3%/per year in coming years. Below is an
annotated forecast chart showing two conventionally computed statistical trend lines from data
ATC forecasts published in spring 2016. (3) See page 10 of the “Preliminary Need Assessment” at: : http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_Pg10
ATC collects and incorporates use projections from the Wisconsin utilities it serves in its 10 year
assessment process. February 21, 2017 planning documentation shows that WI utilities predict a
very sharp decline in anticipated use of interstate transmission in coming years.
Data from page 10 materials has been placed into chart that is provided on the following page.
In 2016 utilities reported an approximate 28% “Reduction in west to east flows through the entire
ATC system” compared to estimates made only one year earlier.
Excluding the 5 year window which is mostly out of the time frame for Cardinal Hickory Creek, WI
utilities projected need to import power west of Wisconsin during higher volume summer months
dropped a whopping 55% in a single year.
There was considerable discussion about this development at the meeting with some of the utilities
noting they had recently decided to not renew “certain contracts” and observations about more
renewable energy development occurring within state. The decline in interstate transmission use dates at least to 2007 as shown on page 9 of the 2014
assessment: http://bit.ly/ATC_2007-2013_9_percent
Note that company reports that imported power in 2013 made up less than 10% of the power sold
by Wisconsin utilities. Import hours for the Western Interface rose a striking 12% from 2013 to
2014 but ATC's contribution to WI electric sales rose only a few percent points. See:
http://bit.ly/ATC_Need_2014_pg9
ATC has not provided percentages for 2015 and 2016 but we note that low and decreasing use of the
electricity market is consistent with national trends as shown in sales records at the MISO Hub in
Indiana provided by EIA: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesale/
(4) See page 11 description of the protocol ATC follows when determining capital replacement of an
existing transmission asset. http://bit.ly/ATC_Econ_Pg11 Although requested by stakeholders,
ATC has yet to update this protocol consistent with FERC Order 1000 including examination of
Non-Transmission Alternatives to prolong the lifespan of aging transmission facilities. These
alternatives are highly cost effective under flat and declining energy use.
As noted in prior EIS comments, the practice of using joint utility/community-supported solar
facilities next to substations to remove demand on aging, costly transformers is already being
developed by Dairyland Power Cooperative.
(5) On page 21, note that declining use has lead to the cancellation of three transmission upgrades that
were justified as necessary in an earlier planning exercise:
http://bit.ly/ATC_Econ_Pg21
(6) See Page 9 of the Economic Planning materials: http://bit.ly/ATC_Econ_Pg9
ATC presents selected drivers from MISO’s most recent planning (MTEP17) for partial adoption.
Of special interest is the footnote linking to energy use refinement for WI:
http://bit.ly/MISO_MTEP17_Zone2_Detail
Like ATC, MISO collects and assesses future projections made by “LBA’s” including Wisconsin
utilities. In contrast, MISO’s resulting forecast for Wisconsin energy use and peak demand predict
a growth of .2% per year through 2026 for the Business as Usual or “Existing Fleet” future. Note
that MISO’s rate is less than half of ATC’s current projection of .48% per year. This is not
insignificant. MISO is predicting WI utilities will sell 3,000,000 MWh less power over the next 10
years.
(7) Assumed energy growth is a key factor in enabling potential benefits from transmission
expansion. Over 30 years, the difference in the “Business as Usual” energy growth rate CHC
applicants cite in the AES (1.06% per year) and what MISO is currently predicting (.2% per year)
amounts to an additional 5 years of 2016 Wisconsin electricity consumed over the next 30 years.
See applicants’ citation in AES: http://bit.ly/MISO_MTEP14_EnergyPredict The associated data is
compiled into the following chart showing 30 year growth rates plotted to scale.

The Truth about Turbines January 2019
The Platteville Journal 11-21-18 had an article about the wind and solar farm proposed by out-of-state companies for Montfort and wind turbine farms for Shullsburg and Belmont. Wind electrical energy generation is presented as a rosy solution to global warming and CO2 reduction by turbine makers, installers, and investors. Looking into the science behind and reality of wind turbines will take the gloss off the pro-turbine hype and present a scenario with the revelation that wind turbines do more damage to our planet than clean coal or gas turbines. Several factors support the demise of wind turbines. First, in the article ""Revealing the Dark Side of Wind Power"" by Mark Buchanan 
(Bloomberg), two Harvard researchers, Miller and l<eith, found that wind turbine-atmospheric wind interaction can actually increase global warming, and they further mention that it would take a turbine field ""more than a century or so before the reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions"" (caused by fossil fuel generators) ""would offset the local warming effect"" (caused by the turbines). 
A second factor that makes wind turbines an ecological disaster is the massive amount of fossil fuels used to make and install them. Think about it. Add up all the fuel burned to mine the steel ore, make the steel, and transport it to the turbine factory; add to that the energy used to make, heat, cool and light the turbine plant as well as make the turbines and fiberglass blades. Also add the fuel used by turbine employees to travel to and from the plant, transport the turbine and tower across the country, doze the massive hole for the concrete turbine base, haul the excavated soil and situate it on a new site, mine and haul the cement used for the concrete, and finally mix, haul, and pour the pad- 6,000 or more yards of concrete hauled by 60 or more trucks for each turbine pad. The carbon footprint of a wind turbine is 250 tons of CO2 just for the concrete pad supporting the tower. Add in the trailer employee village living quarters, all the food and waste that needs to be handled for the turbine installers, as well as the wiring and cable made and installed to carry electricity. There is more, but do you get the picture here? It would probably take another century of turbine operation to overcome the fossil fuel pollution caused by making and installing the wind turbines. We're up to 200 years now. If a turbine needs to be replaced every 20 years, it is easy for anyone to see that wind turbines are actually devastating to the environment. 
Consider a third factor: the environmental damage during the life of a wind turbine. Turbines are serviced 3-4 times per year. Fossil fuels are used by a crew that is required to operate, monitor, and maintain the turbines. Blades and other items sometimes need to be replaced. The lifespan of a turbine is said to be about 20 years for the newer turbines. Earlier models were supposed to last for 20 years but are showing signs of wearing out after 10-12 years. When a turbine wears out, it is ""decommissioned"" by the turbine company and payments to townships and landowners cease immediately. The turbines need to be deconstructed. If the landowner/township does not have fees from the turbine company escrowed for deconstruction, who will pay? There are no federal regulations to mandate cleanup (like mining operations) after a wind farm is done. Is any money escrowed in Seymor Township for the Quilt Block turbines? If the landowner has to pay for deconstruction, all those turbine payments could be quickly consumed. Also, the old fiberglass turbine blades are put in landfills-a big job (ever been next to a monster-size turbine blade?), expending fossil fuels and defiling the environment. 
A fourth factor to consider is the negative health effects caused by wind turbines. Look at the documented pathological effects on the psychology and physiology of the human body. No room to go into this here, but I will say that when wind energy proponents and the ATC electric high transmission tower builders say there are no documented negative health effects, I am reminded of the cigarette companies 40 years ago who said cigarettes were not harmful to health. See the World Health Organization website for a panoply of health effects. 
In addition, turbine towers and blades desecrate the landscape and cause blade noise, shadow flicker, low­frequency sound waves, flashing red lights in your bedroom at night, and your children who do not want to take over the family farm because of the behemoths in their face. The tips of the turbine blades move at over a hundred miles per hour and can throw ice over a quarter mile. Some people, especially land owners who get tower payments, think that the towers are beautiful for about a year or two, until they wish they had never gotten into it. What I cannot understand is how in America a handful of people can decide to put up turbines that ruin the lives of hundreds of people. There needs to be some accountability from wind turbine companies. Consider a situation in Fayette County Iowa where the zoning board approved permits, allowing wind companies to build wind turbines. Land owners fought the permits in court, where a judge agreed with them and declared the permits illegal and void. The turbine builders appealed the decision but put up three wind turbines. The citizens appealed this action to the Iowa Court of Appeals, where a judge ordered the turbine companies to immediately deconstruct the towers-at a cost of $150,000 each. Normal life has returned for the residents. In ""Why Wind Isn't the Answer,"" Robert Bruce City Journal 10-30-18 says, ""Rural residents are objecting to wind projects because they want to protect their property values and viewsheds. They don't want to see the red-blinking lights atop those massive turbines, all night, every night, for the rest of their lives. Nor do they want to be subjected to the health-damaging noise-both audible and inaudible-that the turbines produce."" I foresee more communities legally organizing against turbine farms to have them removed. 
What is the solution to energy production in our global environment? Just two words: individual solar. Individual residential home and farm installations have been working reliably for years, with increasing efficiency and decreasing cost. Even Sean Brady, a regional manager on staff at Wind on the Wires (Clean Grid Alliance), an organization that promotes wind turbine farms and high tower electrical transmission line projects, ""owns, operates, and sells energy from a solar generation facility on his property."" Smart man. Individual solar is rapidly expanding and will significantly further the decline in commercial electrical consumption. California has mandated solar installation on new homes built starting in 2020. Electrical consumption in Wisconsin has been flat or declining for a decade. With the sharp increase in individual solar in the next ten years, the need for commercial electricity could drop by 65%. Large commercial solar fields inactivate good farmland and are a solution for which there is no problem. In the near future, there will be no need for any of the electricity produced by large commercial solar fields like the proposed Badger Hollow project or the wind turbine complexes. I have read that about 40% of wind turbine electricity is dumped because it cannot be used. In five to ten years, Alliant and Dairyland will have a hard time selling the energy they now have. When there is no wind, gas turbines must supply the electricity and be kept running at all times. A gas turbine cannot be turned on and off at will. So the solar fields like Badger Hollow (if built) and turbine farms that out-of-state companies want to install in Wisconsin will be defunct, inactive white elephants. In the article ""The Hidden Costs of Wind Electricity,"" Taylor and Taunton at the American Tradition Institute say that ""generating electricity from wind costs triple what it does from natural gas."" Wisconsin now produces about 15% more electricity than it needs without solar and wind. Where will this excess electricity be used? Who wants this extra electricity? If it is transmitted through and out of Wisconsin (also from Iowa), we citizens will pay the costs and suffer decreased property values and quality of life in order to serve the Eastern USA populations who don't give a rip about Wisconsin. Transmitting electricity is inefficient. For each 100 miles, 1% to 10% of electricity is lost (the electrons lost cause health and environmental consequences). 
It is also interesting that the big wind turbine farms say they need new high tower electrical transmission lines 
(ATC/CHC) to transport the electricity they produce. Not true. The current electrical grid can easily handle and current and planned wind and solar. (Remember electrical consumption is flat or decreasing) They also say they need the big high transmission towers to replace an aging grid. More fake news. I see well-maintained poles and lines in southwest Wisconsin; so I called Alliant Energy and talked to a manager who said that Alliant spends a significant percentage of money to replace distribution infrastructure every year. Alliant says that our grid is ""robust and resilient."" Alliant prides itself in super reliant energy with a strong distribution system, so we have absolutely no need for the ATC/CHC electrical tower projects. 
To summarize, wind generated electricity is primitive, expensive, unreliable, and environmentally devastating when compared to individual solar systems and even gas turbines. Our US government Production Tax Credit pays for 30% of the wind turbine cost. These are your federal tax dollars literally gone with the wind (pun intended). The PTC is being phased out and the credit will drop by 60% in 2022, then to 40% by 2023, and ending in 2024. Without the subsidy, wind turbine installations will drop significantly, which could signal the end of the wind energy industry because they will no longer be economically feasible. Wind turbine companies are actually in a panic to get as many turbine fields started now before they face tough times and lose their subsidy. In the article ""Why It's the End of the Line for Wind Power,"" this phase out period will ""fleece the tax payers of an additional 50 billion"" (that's us, folks-you and me). In 
""Revealing the Dark Side of Wind Power,"" Miller and Keith say that ""wind energy potential is much more limited than previously thought."" They say that big investors are shifting their investments into solar. Wind is a joke; it's finished.

Problems with the Badger Hollow Solar Field
February 2019 

The Platteville Journal, February 5, 2019, published an article on some attributes of the proposed Badger Hollow solar farm in the Montfort area. Mike Vickerman of Renew Wisconsin (who is doing just the opposite of renewing) stated that commercial solar farms are just the greatest thing for beautiful Wisconsin. He is all for inactivating and contaminating prime agricultural land for a period of 30 to 50 plus years. In addition, this beautiful land with installed solar panels would probably never be farmed again. Vickerman says that Wisconsin is way behind in solar installations compared to other states--40th in the nation. However, there is a good reason for this. If Vickerman looked on the map, he would see that Wisconsin is in a more northerly latitude. The reason most large commercial solar fields are in the southwest USA is that land there is not as valuable as and the solar radiation is twice as intense as that of Wisconsin. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) of the US Department of Energy (USDE), the Wisconsin range of solar radiation is 4.5 to 4.0 kWh/m2/day, whereas many of the areas of the SW USA are up to 8.5 kWh/m2/day. Individual residential and farm solar installations do pay off in Wisconsin, but a large commercial solar field has absolutely no place in Wisconsin. What happens when solar panels are covered with snow, or how about ice or tornado damage? The plan to put solar fields in Wisconsin shows not only a lack of knowledge but also a dearth of common sense. Vickerman is also pushing wind turbine farms in Wisconsin. Please read my guest editorial in the January 16, 2019, issue of The Platteville Journal. Wind turbines create distressing health and safety issues as well as devastating ecological and environmental damage. 
Mike also laments that Wisconsin is also behind the nation in wind energy. Again, if he would simply look at the USDE NREL US Wind Resource Map, he would see that only 0.01% of Wisconsin is rated fair as a wind resource; 99.9% of Wisconsin would be rated as poor. Sites in western Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, etc., are rated from good to superb. Evidence clearly shows that Wisconsin is NOT in the wind corridor of the United States. Even David de Leon, CEO of Alliant Energy, wants to put a wind turbine farm in Iowa 
""where the winds are stronger."" Smart man. In fact, with commercial electrical power consumption in Wisconsin flat or dropping as individual and farm solar power is skyrocketing 
(as well as small neighborhood coop and corporation solar fields), there will be absolutely no need for these commercial wind and solar fields that out-of-state companies want to put in our beautiful state of Wisconsin. Unfortunately, the laws in Wisconsin make us ""easy pickins"" for big corporations and ignore the rights of the individual citizens/ land owners in the state. Looking into the future, as individual energy production and efficiency increases, experts predict a sharp decrease in demand for commercial electricity; and any of the commercial solar and wind operations, if built, will become useless, defunct, abandoned white elephants that trash the countryside.

We are of the opinion that the uniqueness and vulnerability of the driftless area of the Midwest has not been fully addressed.

The Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era began approximately 480,000,000 years ago, and during that period the deposits of lead and zinc, and some copper, were formed in the area which is the subject of this book. The geological evolution continued with one great period of time followed by another until enormous ice sheets crept from the polar regions southward and vast regions were covered by glaciers, about a mile thick. The great weight of the glaciers pushed rocks and boulders
and gravel ahead. There was, however, one unique area of about 15,000 square miles that probably escaped the earlier glaciers, certainly the last glacier. It is sometimes called the driftless area, because the last glacier never drifted over it. This pocket or enclave of land is one of the most puzzling prehistoric facts. The theory has been advanced that in prehistoric times both Lake Superior and Lake Michigan covered much larger areas than today; that as the glaciers moved south they followed the beds of the lakes and went around the region that is now Southwestern Wisconsin; that the last glacier missed and thus left, a small area in its ancient condition, rich in lead and zinc ores. Thus Southwestern Wisconsin remained a small island of land in an immense sea
of ice.
The difference between the glaciated and unglaciated areas can be seen sharply if one travels from the east to the west on present Highway 11. The Sugar River forms the dividing line. East of the Sugar River the terrain was flattened by the last glacier, as it melted, deposited rounded granite boulders and rounded gravel on top of the leveled earth. The debris had been picked up hundreds of miles to the north and had been carried and ground in the glacier as it flowed and drifted south. The granite boulders and gravel dropped on the surface are from an entirely different rock formation than the sedimentary formations deep below. So it is that east of the Sugar River one sees today the foundations for houses and barns built of red, grey and black granite boulders, rounded and weathered.
West of the Sugar River there are no such boulders. Not one. The terrain is not level but hilly. The rock formations are sedimentary, deposited ages ago, long before the glaciers, and these fixed formations are of various kinds of limestone and sandstone. West of the Sugar River foundations for houses and barns were built of quarried limestone or quarried sandstone.
It is certain that the small driftless area is very old, certainly the oldest thing on the face of the earth in the Middlewestern United States.”
As we understand it, this phenomenon is also the reason, we have no natural lakes in Southwest Wisconsin.
In conclusion, the driftless area should not be disturbed, unless very, very compelling reasons to the contrary can be demonstrated. We feel that the Cardinal Hickory Creek project falls far short of this threshold."

Comment: The only Alternatives considered in the “Proposed Project and Alternatives” section are route alternatives and the no-action alternative. By addressing potential reliability needs defined by Low Voltage Transmission Alternatives, Non-Transmission Alternatives blending load management, energy efficiency and distributed solar resources meet all the goals cited in RUS’s six-point need for the Proposed Action. 
With energy use flat and declining, regulators are increasingly choosing Non-Transmission Alternatives to provide the same or improved reliability and economic benefits as new transmission projects. In January 2016, the Town Delegation sent RUS case coordinators the names of several nationally known experts in Non-Transmission Alternatives with whom to consult. 
Request: Please conduct the necessary detailed analysis of distributed solar, energy efficiency, storage, and demand response and update your findings in the Final EIS.  Following this analysis, please revise all references to the six-point need test and clarify whether the DEIS has determined and provided for each of the six points:
Point #1: A list of existing NERC reliability violations the Project and the Alternatives   would resolve. Point #2: Quantitative evidence of existing transmission congestion with an explanation of whether the congestion is preventing an adequate supply of electricity in Wisconsin.  If no quantitative evidence of benefits is available explain whether the benefits from reduced congestion for the Project are  included in the Applicants’ estimated net benefit figures ranging from $23.5 million to $350.1 million. Point #3: Quantitative evidence demonstrating that Wisconsin utilities would access “lower cost energy” such as power purchase contracts pending on approval of the Project. Point #4: Quantitative evidence of benefits from avoided line losses for the Project that are not included in the Applicants’ estimated net benefit figures ranging from $23.5 million to $350.1 million.  Point #5: Quantitative evidence of benefits from increased transfer capacity from the Project that are not included in the Applicants’ estimated net benefit figures ranging from $23.5 million to $350.1 million. Point #6: A list of all unmet Wisconsin or Federal public policy requirements pertaining to the development of renewable energy resources.
p.ES-6, DEISv1, “The non-transmission, lower-voltage and underground alternatives were evaluated on the [above] six-point need for the Proposed Action, but were not carried forward for detailed analysis.”
Comment: As noted above, the DEIS contains no quantitative data to meet RUS’s six-point need test.  Furthermore, it should be pointed out that Wisconsin is among the top 10 states for reliable electricity and that a 2009 study, Renewable Resource Potential in Wisconsin by the Energy Center of Wisconsin, concludes there is high potential for NTA’s in the state.
Comment: Failure to evaluate Non Transmission Alternatives ignores the fact that NTAs are being adopted across the country, because by reducing electricity use, they more cost effectively support grid operation and lower CO2 emissions.  Indeed, multiple states have cancelled high-voltage transmission lines in favor of such measures including:  
! The Bonneville Power Administration I-5 Corridor Project; ! The Duke Energy Western Carolinas Modernization line; and, ! The Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway.

Comment: This sentence is very misleading in that it implies that there would be 1300 MW more of wind energy transported by CHC.  Interstate lines are open access lines with no guarantee as to what will actually be transported.
Comment:  Applicants provide no evidence suggesting that Wisconsin utilities will increasingly rely on remote sources of renewable energy to meet RPS requirements.  In absence of this driver, Applicants infer that cost differentials will be large enough to propel increased Wisconsin utility reliance on remote sources of renewable energy.  However, the potential cost difference in the Applicants’ economic analysis seems to be on the order of pennies per month per residential customer based on the Applicants estimate of $23.5 - $350.1 million in net savings over 40 years.  The DEIS does not examine how comprehensive, net savings from investing an equal amount into Non-Transmission Alternatives that blend energy efficiency, load management, and distributed solar compares with the Project.

The Utilities estimate that the incremental increase in transfer capability created by the C-HC Project would be approximately 1,300 MW throughout much of the year.”
p. 27, AES, Table 2-2. Generation Interconnection Requests in MISO Conditional on the Cardinal-Hickory Creek Project being In-Service
Comment: This sentence is very misleading in that it implies that there would be 1300 MW more of wind energy transported by CHC.  Interstate lines are open access lines with no guarantee as to what will actually be transported.
Comment:  Applicants provide no evidence suggesting that Wisconsin utilities will increasingly rely on remote sources of renewable energy to meet RPS requirements.  In absence of this driver, Applicants infer that cost differentials will be large enough to propel increased Wisconsin utility reliance on remote sources of renewable energy.  However, the potential cost difference in the Applicants’ economic analysis seems to be on the order of pennies per month per residential customer based on the Applicants estimate of $23.5 - $350.1 million in net savings over 40 years.  The DEIS does not examine how comprehensive, net savings from investing an equal amount into Non-Transmission Alternatives that blend energy efficiency, load management, and distributed solar compares with the Project. 
Request:  To substantiate the above statement on p. 13 of DEISv1, in the Final EIS, please provide:
a) Independent description (in language that electric customers can understand) of how each wind farm project in Table 2-2.  is contractually contingent upon the Project;
b) An estimate of the total MWH’s per year that would be delivered from the contractually affected facilities to the regional grid as a result of these generators’ capacities under certain conditions no longer being constrained. 
c) Please provide an estimate of the annual MWH generation from the generators in Table 2-2 that would be transported to “load centers like Madison and Milwaukee” by the Project from 2027-2032 (the applicants’ economic study window).  Exclude from this annual total, all amounts that would be transported on existing Iowa Wisconsin/ Minnesota/Wisconsin transmission facilities were the Project not built.

"SOCIO01","General Socioeconomics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","p.14, DEISv1, “Renewable generators are requesting to interconnect with or near the CHC Project in Wisconsin. A 200- MW windfarm (J712) is presently under study at MISO for a potential connection to the new Hill Valley Substation that is part of the C-HC Project. Additionally, three other renewable projects (J855, J870, and J871) have requested interconnection to ATC’s existing Eden Substation near the new Hill Valley Substation. If these projects become operational, it is highly likely that they would be connected at Hill Valley. Because developers sometimes withdraw their requests for interconnection, it is unknown whether any of these renewable generators would interconnect with the new Hill Valley Substation
Table 1.4-2 shows that there are almost 1,800 MW of generation interconnection requests in southwestern and south-central Wisconsin. Many of these requests, though not directly connecting to the C-HC Project, would likely benefit from C-HC in the form of lower costs to interconnect.” 
Comment: To date, neither the Applicants nor RUS have discussed the potential economic impacts on the Project or Alternatives of the significant interest in development of new power plants in Southwestern and South-Central Wisconsin. While it is unknown how many of the 15 power plants in Table 1.4-2 would be built (in part due to the Project), it is possible to estimate whether the new, in-state generation would cause a gain or loss in the Applicants’ net benefit calculations. In considering the impact, it is important to keep in mind that portions of the significant costs of the added power plants would be passed onto ratepayers. 
Request: In this section of the Final EIS, discuss the potential economic impacts on Project interstate transmission capacity and market competition if a conservative 20% of  the Wisconsin-based generation listed in DEISv1 Table 1.4-2, stimulated by the Project with power absorbed at the Hill Valley 138/35kV substation, were built.  Assume a cost of $620 million for 146 MW of natural gas generation, 98 MW of wind generation and 189 MW of solar generation. Assess whether the additions would detract from MISO’s desired goal for MVP projects to increase competition between interstate markets in order to lower prices.  In particular,  inform Wisconsin decision-makers and electric customers if the costly in-state power plant additions would likely increase or decrease the net benefits estimates the Applicants have provided. 
Comment: While the $620 million in added utility-scale generation costs would eventually be assumed by Wisconsin ratepayers, the same amount alternatively applied to double rebates for distributed solar in Wisconsin’s Focus on Energy Rebate program ($500 / kW) would stimulate more than 1200 MW in solar installations on Wisconsin homes, farms, and businesses with net savings, not net costs, to ratepayers collectively.

"SOCIO08","Cost/Benefit Outcome","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","p.15, DEISv1, “When a new transmission line or non-transmission alternative is added to the electric system, prices in certain locations of the energy market can be lowered. For example, when a 345-kV alternative like the C-HC Project is added to the transmission system, the energy market becomes more robust as energy from different generators can now be transmitted to different load points more efficiently and without constraint, thereby increasing competition and driving down market prices. Dairyland and ATC’s customers benefit economically in the MISO energy markets in part due to reduced constraints on transmission lines. According to the Utilities’ planning analysis submitted as part of the application to the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, the C-HC Project would provide net benefits to Wisconsin customers of between $23.5 million and $350.1 million (American Transmission Company et al. 2018).”
Request (a): In the Final EIS, please make editorial changes to make it clear to decisionmakers and  electric customers whether or not all of the estimated economic impacts of the improved access to “lower-cost energy in Iowa” and “energy from different generators” are reflected, in entirety, in the Applicants’ 40 year estimates described in SECTION 1.4.2.1 as net benefits to Wisconsin customers of between $23.5 - $350.1 million.  If not, please describe and quantify any net, estimated energy savings that Wisconsin electric customers could expect that are not incorporated into the range of  $22.7 to $360 million. 
Request (b): To assist Wisconsin electric customers and decision-makers better understand the potential monetary significance of the Project, please  include in the Final EIS an independent translation of the Applicants’ estimated range of 40 year net benefits of  $23.5 to $350.1 million into impacts on the average Wisconsin residential monthly electric bill over the assumed 40 year period calculated in 2018 or 2023 dollars.

"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","Comment:  As originally discussed at a sit down meeting between RUS staff and Dairyland Power Cooperative administrator Chuck Thompson on December 7, 2016 at the Barneveld Scoping Meeting. [ https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/uwp-lgc.pdf#page=17 ], the free floating factors RUS has described in Section 2.2.2.1 are not sufficient to evaluate the amounts of residential solar or substation-supporting solar facilities (and other NTA components) that would be required to provide benefits comparable to those of the Project and the Low Voltage Alternative. Specifically, the Town Delegation noted at this meeting that the AES did not contain a Low Voltage Transmission Alternative required by Wisconsin, which is essential to gauge both cost and capacity requirements for NTA’s. By addressing the same, potential reliability concerns as the Project, the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative is designed to satisfy all transmission-related need except for congestion which is an economic, not a reliability factor.  By removing demand, NTA’s provide direct economic benefits measurable as increased transmission capacity and significant end user savings. Due to the fossil fuel content of wholesale-traded power, NTA’s also reduce CO2 emissions. This benefit can  also be assigned a monetary value.
Comment:  As described on p.6 and p.19 of Town Delegation suggestions about NTA design, [  https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/uwp-lgc.pdf#page=6    https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/uwplgc.pdf#page=19   ], one of the components of state of the art NTA planning involves solar facilities positioned adjacent to substations of identified transmission facilities, thus reducing local load, increasing pass-through transmission capacity, and prolonging the lifespan of expensive components such as transformers. Sized and located properly, these solutions
directly avoid reliability costs and have additional economic benefits by allowing customers to buy or lease solar panels and realize significant net savings over time. 
Request: In the Final EIS, please indicate, per each item, whether RUS independently evaluated the following factors required to estimate benefits from residential solar and substation supporting solar facilities:
a) For the NTA budget, did RUS access and independently confirm the costs of the Project and at least one Low Voltage Transmission Alternative for Wisconsin, Iowa and regional electric customers?
b) To help estimate the NTA budget, did RUS study the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative or  “identified grid reliability deficiencies,” and name, locate and determine component level costs of the low voltage transmission reliability improvements that applicants suggest will be needed over the next 40 years under modest, zero, and negative load growth for Wisconsin and Iowa electric customers?
c) Did RUS estimate the additional kW summer peak capacities at each facility defined by the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative or “identified grid reliability deficiencies,” in  Wisconsin and  Iowa over the next 40 years under modest, zero, and negative load growth?  
d) Did RUS estimate cost per kW of residential and business solar installation rebates under the Wisconsin, Iowa and regional programs?
e) Did RUS estimate 40 year estimated energy savings per kW for installed residential and business solar installations under the Wisconsin, Iowa and regional programs?
f) Did RUS estimate cost per kW for community and aggregate, 30-40 year for solar panel leases/purchases at substation-supporting solar facilities in Wisconsin and Iowa?
g) Did RUS estimate 40 year customer and utility energy savings per kW at substation supporting solar facilities in Wisconsin and Iowa?

The Wisconsin Public Service Commission must address the priorities in Wis. Stat. §§ 196.025 requiring the Commission to give priority to specific methods of meeting energy demands to the extent these methods are “cost-effective and technically feasible.”
 
The Commission must consider options based on the following priorities, in the order listed, for all energy-related decisions:
• Energy conservation and efficiency • Noncombustible renewable energy resources • Combustible renewable energy resources • Nonrenewable combustible energy resources, again in the order listed: ~ Natural gas ~ Oil or coal with a sulfur content of less than one percent o All other carbon-based fuels Note that if the Commission finds that any of these statutorily preferred options, or a combination of these options, constitutes a cost-effective and technically feasible alternative to the project, the Commission must reject all or a portion of the project as proposed.

"ALT02","Proposed Action","ALT","Alternatives","p. 58, DEISv1, “To replace th[e] [P]roject with energy efficiency, energy-efficiency efforts would have to eliminate demand to a level that all the Renewable Portfolio Standards and Goals would be met with existing renewable resources and that the reliability and congestion benefits would be achieved through a dramatic reduction in flows on the regional grid.”
Comment: The 2018 report by the ACEEE (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy), Keeping the Lights On: Energy Efficiency and Electric System Reliability,  outlines the important role Energy Efficiency plays in enhancing grid reliability and relieving congestion. It also makes recommendations on how best to fully capture energy efficiency’s reliability benefits:
“Energy efficiency’s reliability benefits include transmission cost savings, distribution cost savings, minimizing reserve requirements, decreased risk, increased energy security, avoided outages, and avoided restoration costs (Lazar and Colburn 2013).” P. 20 https://www.raponline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rap-lazarcolburnlayercakepaper-2013-sept-09.pdf  
To capture the full reliability benefits of energy efficiency, we make the following recommendations:  Integrated resource planning should fully value the reliability benefits of energy! efficiency in the analysis and selection of resources.  Evaluating non-wires (including targeted energy efficiency) alternatives to T&D! investments should become standard practice.  Capacity auctions and wholesale power markets should include efficiency as a! resource. Those already doing so should expand efficiency resource additions as markets grow and efficiency provides a least-cost, reliable solution. Those currently not doing so should make efficiency eligible to participate in their markets. 

 Energy efficiency and related customer program administrators should explore! integrated efficiency/demand response programs. In doing so, they should also ensure that the rapid rise of smart technologies can deliver both efficiency and demand response benefits along with corresponding grid reliability benefits.  Programs should target critical loads to make them energy efficient and thereby! improve resilience. “ p. 38

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","p. 58 DEISv1, “ FERC defines demand response as “changes in electric use by demandside resources [consumers] from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market process or when system reliability is jeopardized.”
p. 58 DEISv1, “The level of demand response needed to provide sufficient congestion relief to match the scope of the C-HC Project, is not known to currently exist.”
Comment/Explanation:  As the FERC definition lays out, Demand Response can control peak demand and produce reliability benefits as well as economic benefits through reduced transmission congestion.  The Applicants provide no evidence, make no claims that the Project is required to provide an adequate amount of electricity to Wisconsin or Iowa or that there are (NERC) reliability violations that must be met.  Thus, the system associated benefits from the Project and all alternatives are either: 
a) Economic, or lower market prices from lowering transmission congestion or,
b) Cost-effective reliability improvements resulting in lower expense over time to maintain a reliable transmission system.  
PSCW Guidelines for high-voltage transmission projects require that both of these benefits be given monetary values.  The Low Voltage Transmission Alternative is designed to anticipate all possible transmission reliability issues. https://psc.wi.gov/SiteAssets/2017TransmissionLineAFR.pdf 
The amount of Demand Response, or “Load Management,” required to retain reliability standards is a function of the kW capacity reduction required for each reliability project to meet potential increases in demand as determined under a range of growth scenarios. The result is a series of “reliability projects” or, collectively, the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative. The required amount of Load Management or Demand Response is targeted to specific end-users, adding load to specific substations. Once load management is in use, it eliminates need for some of the transmission improvements.  

The congestion-related economic savings created from Demand Response are a (Pro Mod) calculation of projected congestion conditions under a range of growth scenarios for the Project and all Alternatives.  Both determinations are over 40 years.
Here are some other resources on Demand Response: “Demand Flexibility: the key to enabling a low-cost, low-carbon grid”     https://www.rmi.org/wpcontent/uploads/2018/02/Insight_Brief_Demand_Flexibility_2018.pdf

PSCW Guidelines for high-voltage transmission projects require that both of these benefits be given monetary values.  The Low Voltage Transmission Alternative is designed to anticipate all possible transmission reliability issues. https://psc.wi.gov/SiteAssets/2017TransmissionLineAFR.pdf 
The amount of Demand Response, or “Load Management,” required to retain reliability standards is a function of the kW capacity reduction required for each reliability project to meet potential increases in demand as determined under a range of growth scenarios. The result is a series of “reliability projects” or, collectively, the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative. The required amount of Load Management or Demand Response is targeted to specific end-users, adding load to specific substations. Once load management is in use, it eliminates need for some of the transmission improvements.  

The congestion-related economic savings created from Demand Response are a (Pro Mod) calculation of projected congestion conditions under a range of growth scenarios for the Project and all Alternatives.  Both determinations are over 40 years.
Here are some other resources on Demand Response: “Demand Flexibility: the key to enabling a low-cost, low-carbon grid”     https://www.rmi.org/wpcontent/uploads/2018/02/Insight_Brief_Demand_Flexibility_2018.pdf

Continuing Explanation:  Load management is continuous  monitoring; it is timed and targeted for specific transmission assets that Applicants  have projected to potentially experience overload issues under certain conditions. Under current flat use, growth is, at best, very low. 
Load management can be very cost effective because it can be required only for a few hours on a few days of a year.
Because the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative is designed to provide the same future reliability goals as the project, the only difference between the Low Voltage Transmission Alternative and the Project is economic— that is— the amount of congestion in the resulting transmission system. These economic differences, or energy cost savings, are incorporated into the applicants’ net benefits for all Alternatives and apply to NTA’s as well. For example, the potential net benefits for the Project range from  $23.5- $350.1 million over 40 years.

If this level of reduction could be achieved in the C-HC Project area, peak demand growth could be negative. However, as indicated above, there is no regulatory authority to ensure energy user compliance with load reduction and energy efficiency goals and, thus, no mechanism has been identified that would ensure adequate participation over time (PSCW 2011).”

"AIR04","Climate Change","AIR","Air Quality","p.218, DEISv1, “Climate change is a global issue that results from several factors, including, but not limited to,the release of GHGs, land use management practices, and the albedo effect, or reflectivity of various surfaces (including reflectivity of clouds). Specific to the proposed project, GHGs are produced and emitted by various sources during the development and operational phases of transmission lines. 
The primary sources of GHGs associated with transmission lines and substations are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from fuel combustion in construction and maintenance vehicles and equipment, as well as operational emissions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) associated with potential leakage from gas-insulated circuit breakers at the substation. An analysis of regional climate impacts prepared by the Third National Climate Assessment (Garfin et al. 2014) concludes that the rate of warming in the Midwest has markedly accelerated over the past few decades. The higher temperatures and continued human pollution increases the number of heat events and extreme rain events that cause flooding.”
Comment: The climate affecting impacts of the post construction, ~40 year operation phase of the Project and all Alternatives, are not evaluated or discussed in the DEIS. 
Comment:  There are many avenues available to electric customers  towards realizing significant CO2 and harmful emission reductions. The DEIS contains numerous references to the action of accessing remote renewable energy which readers, without quantitative evidence, may construe as automatically and significantly reducing C02 emissions associated with the generation and distribution of centrally supplied electricity.  
Comment: In October, 2018, EIA released national figures showing that from 2005 to 2017, about 50% of the CO2 emission reductions associated with electricity generation came from energy efficiency, conservation, load management, distribute generation and other practices directly lowering use of grid supplied power. In contrast, about 24% was attributed to renewable energy expansions with the other 26% coming from natural gas generation displacements.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","Mid-continent Independent System Operator, Electric Generation, and Transmission Load Forecasts (for Wisconsin & Iowa)
p.A-1, Appendix A,  DEISv2,”An important factor in system reliability planning is the projection of future load forecasts, both regional and local...electricity use has generally increased in Wisconsin and Iowa since 1990....Historical electricity usage in Wisconsin was 49,198 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 1990, 65,146 GWh in 2000, and 69,495 GWh in 2014. In Iowa, it was 29,437, 39,088, and 47,202 GWh in those same years, respectively. Compound annual average growth rates were 1.45% and 1.99%, respectively, over that period (Gotham et al. 2016)” 
Comment:  This assessment ignores the three most recent years of data and calculates change in electricity use over 24 years conflicting with well established  trends and appreciations. Comment: Why is RUS, a federal government agency, asking MISO, a non-government entity, to provide information about state energy use rather than accessing data that all utilities are required to submit to the federal government through EIA ? A study conducted by the Rocky Mountain Institute showed a pattern of exaggerated growth in utility based projections:  
“Rocky Mountain Institute’s analysis shows that for at least the last decade, planners have, on average, over-forecast electricity demand by one percentage point for each year of their forecast. That might seem trivial, but a one percentage point over-forecast every year means that forecasts more than 10 percent too high 10 years out. That 10 percent over-forecast translates to spending billions of dollars on power plants that no one needs, but that need to be paid for.” https://rmi.org/billion-dollar-costsforecasting-electricity-demand/   
Comment: What advantage to electric customers and decision makers does RUS see in ignoring the industry standard of10 year timeframes? What is the purpose of using a 24 year time frame when it averages-out the relevance of  the historical transformation in electricity use starting in 2007 when US energy use  started flattening or declining?  
Request: In the Final EIS, use more contemporary EIA data such as Retail Sales of Electricity by State by Sector by Provider (EIA-861) and statistical trend lines to provide electric 

customers in Wisconsin and Iowa a much more useful portrayal of the current trends in electricity use in their states.  https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/sales_annual.xlsx
Adding EIA data from the last three years, Wisconsin total electricity use dropped an average of .323% per year from 2007 to 2017.  Iowa’s use increased  a modest .89% per year over the same period.  See table of EIA data below.

p.A-3, Appendix A,  DEISv2, ”As shown in Table A-2, in the MISO region electricity load is forecasted to increase from 667,822 GWh in 2015 to 783,121 GWh in 2026, without adjusting for EE/DR/DG, an increase of 115,299 GWh or a 1.46% compound annual average growth rate. When adjusting for EE/DR/DG, it is forecasted to increase to 774,270 GWh, an increase of 106,448 GWh and a 1.35% compound annual average growth rate. Thus, implementing EE/DR/DG measures in the MISO area is projected to result in an annual average 0.11% reduction in electricity use from 2015 through 2026 (Gotham et al. 2016).” 
 Comment:  The Applicants have consistently taken their load and energy projections analysis from approved MTEP planning, not from the cited Gotham analysis. 
Request: In the Final EIS, for MISO energy and demand projections, use MISO’s recent MTEP19 percentages.  They can be found on page 2 of this recently published economic planning document on ATC’s website:   https://cdn.misoenergy.org/MTEP19%20Futures %20Summary291183.pdf#page=2   
The average (base) Demand rate that MISO projects is .3% growth per year with Energy at .4% per year. Note that one of MISO’s futures assumes flat Energy Demand or no growth.  
Adhering to RMI’s observation that projections by utility interests have averaged about 1% per year above actual usage, MISO’s usage and peak are more likely to drop than to increase.p.A-6, Appendix A,  DEISv2, “A significant factor in forecasting changes in future electricity usage in an area is the projected changes in population levels, and the associated changes in economic activity that are generated by that increase in population.” Comment: The figures in Table A-5. Wisconsin Population Levels (1980–2010) and Projections (2010–2040) indicate there was a 1.4% per year growth in Wisconsin’s population from 2005 to 2010.  The premise that electricity usage and economic activity are directly related as RUS suggests in this section is demonstratively false. Note that EIA Form 861 data show that electricity use in Wisconsin over the period of 2005 to 2010 dropped 2.25%. Comment: Methodology is especially important when contesting trends recognized by most governmental parties.  For example, Madison is regarded as a rapidly growing area. Considering its proximity to the Project’s Cardinal substation, analyzing Madison Gas and Electric usage from 2007-2017 would be highly appropriate. (See table, below.)  Note that 2007-2017 revenue increased 23% while electricity usage dropped 3%.  Discussion in the PSC’s most recent Strategic Energy Assessment on Revenue Recovery for Wisconsin Utility Capital Spending helps explain this discrepancy.
Comment:  These findings are consistent with US Department of Energy analysis showing there is no longer a direct relationship between economic activity and electricity use as measured in GDP:
 Request: In the Final EIS, either remove this section pertaining to population influence entirely, or use more recent population projection data removing all inference that population growth and economic GDP are directly responsible for increases in energy use. Base any argument to the contrary around Madison using EIA data. If not, explain why power sinks other than Madison are more important to consider.

Bald Eagle Nests and Habitat
Because Bald Eagle are a “Species of Special Concern” in Wisconsin and Federally protected by the Bald & Golden Eagle Protection Act, special attention should be given to the potential harm posed by the CHC proposal to individual birds, breeding pairs and their habitat. Wisconsin has 1,465 eagle nests (2015 data), of which 51 are located in the 4 counties that would be traversed by the CHC corridor. The CHC transmission towers and lines would occur in townships where 26 of the 51 active nests have been documented. Construction and operation of the CHC towers and lines would threaten the safety and well being of the Bald Eagle population, their nest sites and habitat in these townships.
Dane County has 1 active eagle nest (out of a total 9 nests in the county) in a township (Town of
Vermont) that would be crossed by the CHC corridor.
Grant County has 14 active eagle nests (out of 38 total nests in the county) in 4 townships that would be crossed by the CHC corridor. The Town of Cassville has 4 nests, Town of Clifton has 1, Town of Potosi has 2, and Town of Waterloo has 7.
Iowa County has 11 active eagle nests (out of 13 in the county) in 7 townships that would be crossed by the CHC corridor. The Town of Arena has 2 nests, Town of Brigham has 1, Town of Dodgeville has 1, Town of Highland has 3, Town of Linden has 1, Town of Mifflin has 1 and Town of Wyoming has 2.
Lafayette County has one active eagle nest, but it does not occur in any of the townships that would be crossed by the CHC corridor in this county.
Although transmission companies often deny there is danger to eagles, construction can alter nesting activities and there are well documented reports of reduction of critical populations; here is one: https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jrr/v035n03/p00247-p00252.pdf.
A review will be needed to determine 1) the immediate loss of individual birds and/or nests likely to occur due to placement and use of construction equipment, making roadways and clearing the right of ways, and building the towers and lines themselves and 2) ongoing annual losses of birds and nests due to collisions, electrocutions, herbicide applications and loss of habitat if ATC were to construct the CHC line.

WI Status: Protection category designated by the DNR.
END = endangered;
THR = threatened;
*SC = special concern.
SC/P = fully protected;
SC/N = no laws regulating use, possession, or harvesting;
SC/H = take regulated by establishment of open closed seasons;
SC/M = fully protected by federal and state laws under the Migratory Bird Act.
*Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and federal regulations regarding special concern species
range from full protection to no protection. Special concern species are those species about which some
problem of abundance or distribution is suspected but not yet proved. The main purpose of this category
is to focus attention on certain species before they become threatened or endangered.
Federal Status: Federal protection status designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Endangered
Species Program indicating the biological status of a species in Wisconsin.
LT = listed threatened;
*SOC = species of concern
*Federal species of concern are those species that may be in need of concentrated conservation actions,
which vary depending on the health of the populations and degree and types of threats. They receive no
legal protection and are not necessarily species that will eventually be proposed for listing as threatened
or endangered."
"VEG02","TES Plant Species","VEG","Vegetation","Threatened and Endangered Species and Species of Concern
The ATC/CHC proposed corridors through Iowa and Dane counties traverse many high-quality habitats
for threatened, endangered and Federal Species of Concern (SOC). The area's characteristic Southern
Sedge Meadows, Oak Openings and Barrens, Pine Relicts, Dry Prairies, Mesic and Dry-mesic Forests,
fast, cold Streams, Dry and Moist Cliffs and Forested Seeps shelter and nurture diverse populations of
birds, insects, amphibians, reptiles and plants.
A quick review of Wisconsin's Natural Heritage Inventory for the township/ranges under active CHC
corridors reveals the following species would be at risk from the project:
Birds
Henslow Sparrow (found in 12 of the 16 township/ranges under CHC corridors in Iowa and Dane
Counties)
Loggerhead Shrike (found in 2 of the 16 township/ranges in both counties)
Threatened species found here are: Acadian Flycatcher, Bell's Vireo, Cerulean Warbler, Hooded Warbler
and upland Sandpiper. A Western Meadowlark population has been identified only in Brigham
Township, Dane County.
Bees
The rare Rusty-Patched Bumble Bee has been identified in 8 of the 11 township/ranges (all in Iowa
County) traversed by the CHC line.
Butterflies
Regal Fritillary populations are located in 2 township/ranges in Iowa County and 2 in Dane County.
Frogs and Turtles
Blanchard's Cricket Frog populations have been identified in 8 of the 11 Iowa County township/ranges
traversed by CHC corridors.
Pickerel Frog populations have been recorded in 8 of the 16 township/ranges (in both counties).
Blanding's Turtle populations have been found in 6 of the 16 township/ranges (in both counties).
Ornate Box Turtle populations have been recorded in 6 of the 16 township/ranges (in both counties).
Fish and Snakes
The Lake Sturgeon has been identified in one township/range under the CHC line in Iowa County. Lake
Chubsucker and the threatened Pugnosed Shiner have both been identified in one township/range
located in Middleton township, Dane. County.
More detail from Wisconsin's Natural Heritage Inventory (NHI) is available in the following pages.

Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern Species Documented in the Iowa and Dane County
Townships Crossed by the Proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek Transmission Line
The following is a list of species and natural features on the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resource’s Natural Heritage Working List that have been documented for each Public Land Survey
System (PLSS) township in Iowa and Dane Counties that is crossed by the proposed Cardinal-Hickory
Creek Transmission Line.
Bald eagles and sensitive species (such as rattlesnakes and bats) are not included in this data, where
applicable. Each species or community on the list has been documented in at least one location (but
possibly many locations) within the township. These data were last updated on May 13, 2016, so there
may be more recent county records not reflected here. Status definitions are located at the end of this
document.
Please note that absence of data does NOT necessarily indicate absence of a species. Basically, we find
species where we look for them, and many of these areas have not been thoroughly inventoried. This
data was copied from http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/NHI/data.asp?tool=township on September 29, 2016.

"WLDLF04","TES Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","Many people do not know what a relict is. These pine relicts are direct descendants of ancient pine forests that had covered all of WI after the Ice Age. Protected from prairie fires by unglaciated rocky terrain, these alpine communities survived prairie fires and nearby development with both Northern and Southern plant species. It is unique in the world to have this quantity and quality of combined Northern alpine species along side Southern WI species. They are becoming even more important in this age of climate change because they have the resilience of shade and of deep cold water in rock formations to cool the flora and fauna. We have a Great Blue Heron rookery, coyotes, bobcats, Whipperwills, Walking Fern, etc. See http://www.friendsofridgewaypinerelict.org/ to see a visual tour. For more technical information about species being studied see the state's website at http://www.friendsofridgewaypinerelict.org/about.html. Wisconsin's endangered Ornate Box Turtle is also found close by.

"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives"," Even if more power were ever needed, upgrading existing lines, local renewable energy projects already being built, accelerating energy efficiencies, and practical load management techniques would insure reliable, steady flows of electrical energy at a much lower cost, economically and environmentally. Because of these many factors, the Friends of the Ridgeway Pine Relict supports using local energy generation and transmission options that minimize the negative environmental impact on the pine relicts and the community instead of the wasteful and out-moded Cardinal-Hickory Creek Transmission Line.

The Ridgeway Pine Relict SNA was created with the goal of protecting the pine relicts that feature soaring sandstone cliffs, numerous rock outcrops, shallow caves and rock shelters. Pine relicts are southern Wisconsin pine forests that have persisted since the last glacier receded some 12,000 years ago when a cooler climate was favorable for the growth of pine forests. As the climate warmed, prairie and oak woodlands replaced the pine and today remnant pine forests remain only on steep slopes and rocky cliffs in the Driftless Area. These rocky outcrops protected the pine remnants from fire and allowed the pines to reach old-growth status. The pine relicts at Ridgeway are the best remaining in Wisconsin. The relict communities are unlike the northern pine forests in that they contain both northern and southern understory plant species. White pine and red pine dominate the tree canopy, while sugar maple, mountain maple, yellow birch, and hemlock constitute a smaller component. The ground flora includes pipsissewa, shin leaf, wintergreen huckleberry, and Canada mayflower. There is also a high diversity of ferns present. Other significant features of the property include sandstone cliffs with shaded and open plant communities, diverse spring runs, sedge meadows, and dry-mesic prairie. Several species of greatest conservation need are found on or near the Day property at Ridgeway Pine Relict. They include three forest interior bird species listed as State-Threatened: Acadian flycatcher, cerulean warbler, and hooded warbler.

""Potential effects"" or ""potential impacts"" vs. simply ""effects"" or ""impacts""  What will ultimately be the actual effects/impacts of C-HC are currently unknown.  Therefore, the DEIS and FEIS are evaluating the ""potential"" effects/impacts of this Project.  Some text definitively concludes that such effects and impacts will be made.  Other chapters clearly identify that the document is discussing potentialities.  Examples of sections that used ""potential""  appropriately include:  Transportation, Health and Safety.

Under the current schedule, the FEIS will be released before the PSCW selects a route and the PSCW's route may not comport exactly with one of the RUS's Action Alternatives. It may be beneficial to have the FEIS organized differently than the DEIS in recognition that the PSCW may select a route that differs from one of the DEIS's Action Alternatives.  The following are two suggestions intended to achieve that goal:  
(1)  The Utilities have submitted two proposed routes to the PSCW. The RUS's DEIS only contains one of those two alternatives (viz. Action Alternative 6 is the same as the ""Preferred Route."")  Since the PSCW may select the Utilities' Alternate Route (or a combination of the Utilities' Preferred and Alternate Routes), we recommend that RUS create a new Action Alternative that equates with the Utilities' ""Alternate Route"" as specified in their CPCN application.
(2)  Rather than select either the Preferred  or  Alternate Routes as presented in the Utilities' CPCN Application, the PSCW may substitute one or more segments into those alternatives.  Indeed, the RUS asked that the Utilities add some segments that are identified as ""other segments"" in the CPCN application, which the PSCW could select.  
Rather than analyzing end-to-end alternatives in the FEIS, we recommend the RUS consider conducting the environmental impact analysis in blocks that could be easily combined together to create whatever end-to-end alternative the PSCW selects."

(2)  Rather than select either the Preferred  or  Alternate Routes as presented in the Utilities' CPCN Application, the PSCW may substitute one or more segments into those alternatives.  Indeed, the RUS asked that the Utilities add some segments that are identified as ""other segments"" in the CPCN application, which the PSCW could select.  
Rather than analyzing end-to-end alternatives in the FEIS, we recommend the RUS consider conducting the environmental impact analysis in blocks that could be easily combined together to create whatever end-to-end alternative the PSCW selects."

(1)  For the reasons explained below, it may be easier to have a section dedicated on EMF in Chapter 3 rather than include it within the Health and Safety section.  
(2)   Pages 387-388 clearly specify that EMF does not cause any adverse public health effects for long-term, low exposure EMF levels, including those that would be produced by this Project.  Accordingly, it is misleading to imply there is a relationship between EMF and health effects as a result of this Project. Nevertheless, in numerous locations, the DEIS construes C-HC as having a negative impact on public health and safety because of EMF.
(3) The definitions for potential impacts on page 392 are misleading.  They are as follows:    
     (a)  """"Minor impact: Operation of the C-HC Project would not result in increased exposure to EMF levels, which would rise to a level of concern with regard to public health and safety.""""
     (b) """"Moderate Impact: Operation of the C-HC Project would increase exposure to EMF levels, but not to a level that would adversely affect public health and safety"""".
     (c) """"Major Impact:  Operation of the C-HC Project would increase exposure to EMF levels to a level high enough to adversely affect public health and safety."""" 
All of these definitions assume a causal connection between exposure to EMF and public health and safety that does not exist.  Where there is not a potential public health and safety impact, there would be """"no potential impact."""" 
(5) Page 388 states """"short-term exposure to higher intensities of EMF (above exposure levels of electrical and industrial workers) could produce adverse stimulation of nerves and muscles.""""   There is no evidence presented that transmission line workers would be exposed to such levels.  So, there is also no occupational EMF health risk for this Project.  
(6)  Page 441 states """"Because the levels of EMF created by the proposed project would be relatively low when compared to the recommended public and occupational exposure guidelines, the cumulative impact from EMF under all alternatives would be minor and long term.""""

If constant work were being performed near existing transmission-line facilities that posed any kind of a safety threat, the existing transmission facilities would be turned off, eliminating exposure to EMF for construction crews. due to a potential for induced voltage, then either work being performed would modified to reduce impacts from induced voltages or an outage on the existing transmission facilities would be requested, which would reduce or eliminate the potential for induced voltages at the location where the work is being performed.

This data contains changed, renamed (because the segments have been split into two), and additional sub-segment identifiers that are not reflected in the DEIS. As a consequence, all of the tables in Appendix C are outdated.
 
While RUS is aware of these changes, we wanted to highlight the difficulties posed by using version 5 of the routing data:  
p. C-30: In addition to the five unused segments identified in Table C-10, R10 is also unused.  In the DEIS, R10 is ascribed to Alternative 5, but one of its ends would not connect to anything if used in Alternative 5. 

The following are additional segment identifiers introduced in the updated dataset that are currently not included in Appendix C and, apparently, are not used in any of the Action Alternatives:  B-IA2, D10A, D10B, D10C, M03, M04, M05, G06A, G06B, and Y01C. Many of these segments were used as part of either the Utilities' Preferred or Alternate Routes that were submitted in their CPCN application in Wisconsin.  The following specifies the importance of those segments and we urge RUS to analyze them in detail in the DEIS, if not as part of one of the Action Alternatives, then as standalone subsegments because they may be selected by the PSCW:
(1)  Segments D10A and D10B are common segments to both the Utilities' Preferred and Alternate Routes used for routing the 138-kV X-16 line into the Hill Valley Substation. 
(2)  Segment D10C is used in the Alternate Route to get the X-16 line to the Hill Valley Substation.
(3)  Segments G06A and G06B are critical to the Utilities' Alternate Route as they are the sole connection between Segments F03 and G08 south of Platteville.  (Segment G06 presented in Appendix C consists of current segments G06A and G06B.)

"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources"," PHOTO SIMULATION OF THE PROPOSED TOWERS: I want to address the Photo Simulation Viewpoint images, pages 322-332. I was a university professor for forty years teaching visual literacy, photography, and filmmaking. For twenty-eight of those years I was a Professor in the Department of Radio/Television/Film at Northwestern University, where I also served as Department Chair. I have deep expertise in the area of photographic representation. It is not clear who took the Photo Simulation Viewpoint images on pages 322-332 but the draft EIS takes them at face value without questioning their obvious bias. The photo simulations are misleading; they use well-known techniques to minimize the visual impact of the towers on the landscape. 	Ice Age National Scenic Trail (Figures 3.11-4 to 3.11-13): o	The photos in these figures are taken from very high up, from a hill or bluff, which makes the towers look small in the landscape. This is a trick that all photographers know – the higher up you stand shooting looking down, the more you ""flatten"" the perceived height of objects in the landscape; this distortion is greater with a wide angle lens, which was used for these photos. I know what lens was used because there is a large depth of field in the images possible only with wide-angle lenses. Furthermore, these images are shot during the warm months with trees fully leafed out. The lush vegetation visually distracts from the towers. Many people use these trails all year long, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months. Thus the actual scale of these towers, as people in the landscape traversing the trails would experience them, is hidden by the techniques used to shoot these photos. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources"," 	Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge: o	Figures 3.11-16 to 3.11-19 use distance and wide-angle lenses to diminish the visual impact of the towers. Figure 3.11-17 is shot at ground level; this is the way people will experience the towers. However, this photo is taken with the base of a tower in the foreground, which means the tower’s height is cut off by the top of the frame, thus we have no sense of how tall these towers are or experienced in the landscape. Placing a person within the frame, standing next to the tower, would have provided scale and a more accurate sense of its massive width and height. o	Figures 3.11-19 to 3.11-21 are inaccurate representations of the towers in ways similar to the previous photos discussed."
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","	Great River Road in Wisconsin: o	Figures 3.11-22 and 3.11 -23 have no simulations because the text states it is unnecessary given that the towers will be hidden by vegetation. However, the vegetation shown is a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees. Once the leaves drop in the fall, how do we know the towers will not be visible?"
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","	Town of Cassville: o	Figure 3.11-26: In this photo the second, third, and forth towers are partially hidden behind the buildings on the left, which diminishes their impact in the simulation. People walking through this town will not have that luxury. The only tower fully shown (the older steel one at the top of the hill) is far in the background of the frame and because of the distortion of perspective that occurs with the wide-angle lens used, the tower in the distance looks small and not dominating. This distortion is also true for the newer towers behind the buildings. The photographer chose a street that has a lot of distribution wires both parallel to the street and crossing the street. This means that when you see the additional wires added by the proposed transmission line they blend in with the distribution wires and don't look so bad. But most of the time, since the proposed routes traverse rural areas, the transmission line won't have distribution lines to visually ""hide"" among. The height of the tower in the foreground is hidden because the top of the frame cuts it off and there is no person standing next to it for scale. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","	Blue Mounds State Park: o	Figures 3.11-27 and 3.11-28 are shot with a wide-angle lens from a hill or bluff. The wide-angle lens distorts the perspective, making objects in the distance (the towers) look smaller then they will be perceived in real life by the eye. Certainly, there will be places along the proposed routes where the towers will be hidden from where we stand in the landscape and by the characteristics of the land itself, but that is only a small percentage of the towers. Yet this particular landscape, not representative of the whole route, was chosen for the simulation. Attached to this email is a photo taken of an ATC tower that is part of the Arrowhead Weston 345kV line in Douglas County, Wisconsin. The woman standing with her arms spread at the base of this tower is 5’2” tall. This photographs gives a much clearer representation of how the similar C-HC towers will be experienced in the landscape, compensating for the distortion of using a wide-angle lens by placing a person in the frame. The woman’s position against the tower is critical because the image was shot with the wide-angle lens of a smart phone, distorting the size of the towers as they move away into the distance – making them look smaller then they actually are. Only the woman standing against the first tower accurately shows the scale of them. "

Efficiency of electricity use Technological changes in the past decade have accentuated the effectiveness of investments in improving the efficiency of energy use (including load management), in terms of reducing the demand for transmitted electrical energy which is still high on the proportion of CO2 produced through fossil fuel generation plants. The EIS should assess whether taking the projected investment of a half billion dollars in CHC and putting that half billion dollars into improved efficiency of electricity use and rapid extension of DERS would better meet the needs of our electrical system, including the reduction of CO2 emissions in the list of “needs”.

"EFF01","General Effects Analysis","EFF","Effects Analysis","3. Assessment of environment impacts of past investments in HVTLs A recent letter from a bipartisan group of Wisconsin legislators to the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (attached) calls for an independent assessment of the impacts of past investments in HTVLs like the CHC. RUS should join this group and urge the PSC to do an environmental impact study of already completed and functioning HTVLs called for by MISO 10 years ago. RUS should insist that the WPSC put the CHC project on hold at least until that study of past investments in HTVLs is completed."
"SOCIO08","Cost/Benefit Outcome","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","4. Pay back period Given the speed of technological change in electricity generation, distribution and efficiency of use, the 40 year payback period which the applicants for CHC have used, and the actual schedule which ATC used for replacement of poles and wires—75 years—both seem excessively long. The CHC is likely to be obsolete technologically in a much shorter period of time. This means that the environmental damages of the have to be valued against the promised economic benefits which have to be produced in a much shorter time. So, RUS should insist that the applicants use a 10 year payback period to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of the proposed CHC. "

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","	The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has not demonstrated a need for the proposed transmission lines. The applications assumes that Wisconsin will purchase renewable power generated from Iowa, but does not indicate there have been any agreements or discussion to do so. WI now and in the past decade has had a flat demand for electric power, why would WI purchase additional renewable power when they meet and exceeded their goal for renewable generation? The final EIS should make clear that the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) agreement will force WI to purchase renewable generation from IA whether needed or not. Since renewable energy will at best provide 8 to 15 percent of our electrical power consumption, MISO and the power utililies associated with this proposed transmission line expansion will engage in energy arbitration similar to what now occurs between the States of California and Arizona. How will the final EIS address the misleading indication that Wisconsin needs or wants to purchase renewable energy from an opportunistic State (Iowa) which makes a show of their virtue in wind generation at an additional cost burden to Wisconsin?

Several noted experts in the field of property values associated with transmission lines have publically stated that property values adjacent to transmission lines have experienced a losses in market value of between 20 and 40 percent. In addition, sale of property adjacent to transmission lines has been difficult, which we have firsthand experience. How will the final EIS correct this misinformation and describe a more accurate discussion of loss in property value, in residual, commercial and community facilities?"
"WAT02","Surface Water/Groundwater","WAT","Water Resources","	Potential ground water pollution due to construction of the transmission line pole construction. Groundwater pollution, in varying degrees, exists today over much of the proposed transmission line route. Most of this is due to agricultural use of the land.

Herbicide runoff from maintenance of the right‐of‐way potentially will pollute groundwater.

For several years we have been exposed to the possibility of having huge transmission towers 'walk' across the Driftless Area of Southwest Wisconsin.

I and many people are so opposed to these towers BECAUSE these structures would destroy the very reason people choose to live here. The Driftless Area is a beautiful and unique slice of America; people live here by choice because they enjoy beauty and nature, not concrete.

We have an excellent work ethic here; growing our own dairy products; cheese, milk etc. as well as CSA's, manufacturing, and business startups. We have authentic Wisconsin Pride here! As I drive across this area for daily activities, I see the work of so many local people who have banned together: displaying banners, bumper stickers and sporting yard signs against these monstrosities, some of which will not even be viewable from their location.

More solar arrays are privately being built. Solar electricity flows back to the electric companies, so why do we need more methods? Iowa County electrical needs are more than met already and it is projected that the population here will not likely increase. I also understand that Middleton has refused to sell its power to ATC and that a huge solar array is planned for Highland, as are many others in the southern Wisconsin area electric company facilities. Keeping electric usage close to the solar panel source is the most efficient: power loses strength over distance for both solar and wind. Both Madison Gas & Electric and Alliant Energy are asking state regulators to approve new community solar programs, while Xcel Energy has completed its second solar garden in Wisconsin. Madison is highly progressive in this field. These programs allow customers to buy into solar projects without having to put panels on their roofs. "

We live in a moment of transition of electrical use, the digital world, and climate change. All of this will affect the distribution of electricity in the near and far future. The world in 2002, when Cardinal-Hickory Creek was first proposed, was a very different world than it is one we live in now. Our regional bulk transmission system is questionable given its vulnerability both to the unpredictability of climate change and to the grid's already proven vulnerability to hacking. The Russians are busy hacking into our grid, according to a Department of Homeland Security red alert last year and a remarkable piece of investigative journalism by the Wall Street Journal this past January. Wisconsin companies even were targeted in the Russian hacking campaign. This suggests reliability would more readily be achieved and money would be better spent on IT personnel and technologies to protect the digital systems of our utilities and their suppliers and not by planting more steel in the ground. That is an outdated 20th Century solution for a 21st Century problem."

For example, the Draft EIS resolved comments pertaining to differing corridor widths along different sections of the alignment and commitments to minimize and/or mitigate for potentially-affected environmental resources during construction and operation of the transmission system. Because this version of the Draft EIS provides clarification to previous EPA comments, EPA has relatively minor comments at this stage. 
 Our comments on the Draft EIS pertain to construction-related air impacts and impacts to terrestrial natural resources. Effective October 22, 2018, EPA no longer includes ratings in our Draft EIS comment letters. Information about this change and EPA' s continued roles and responsibilities in the review of federal actions can be found on our website at https://www.epa.gov/nepa/environmental-impact-statement-rating-system-criteria. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this Draft EIS and to have participated in early stages of project development as a cooperating agency.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process"," The most important fact, you've heard this before folks about the C-HC electrical transmission line, is that there is absolutely no need for it; okay? Commercial electricity use is flat or declining in Wisconsin because of the increased NTAs, mainly individual residential and farms' solar installations, also increased efficiency in use of electricity. The last nine transmission projects like this in the United States have been shut down; okay? So we're going to shut this one down, too. All right. It has been estimated that in 10 years the need for commercial electricity will decrease by 65 percent. An engineer at a recent meeting attended by MISO, pro C-HC organizations and C-HC applicants, said that the C-HC line is designed for an economic life of 75 years. However, he also said that we won't need that line in 10 years. So my question is, who is going to pay -- where is the money going to come from to pay for the bonds and the loans? Now, they mentioned the reliability here of the transmission grid and I did talk to a member of the Alliant -- I'm shaking here. AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: You're doing well. Just continue. AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Alliant Energy. GEORGE SCHWARZMANN: Yes. I talked with an Alliant Energy consumer rep who said that Alliant's transmission grid is up to date, robust, and resilient, with an excess capacity to handle all present and foreseeable needs. There is no need for C-HC. And I don't see anywhere in the EIS statement the calculations and projections for the need for C-HC. Where is the need? I don't see any discussions or projections for individual residential, farm, solar, NTA's economic justification for the C-HC line in the EIS. "

Overview  
Authorized in 1980, Ice Age NST encompasses 1,200 miles of lakes, river valleys, prairies, forests, gently rolling hills, and ridges formed by glacial activity thousands of years ago across

the state of Wisconsin. Approximately 700 miles of trail has been built and is open for public use. The trail is managed through strong partnerships between the NPS, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Ice Age Trail Alliance (IATA), and is used by over 1 million people each year for hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, snowshoeing, and other outdoor recreational activities.3, 4 Ice Age NST is part of a park system that contributed over $64 million to Wisconsin’s economy in 2017 and an average of over $61 million a year over the last five years.5 The glacial remnants included within Ice Age NST are considered among the world’s finest examples of how continental glaciation sculpted our planet. The trail provides opportunities for people to immerse themselves in a large natural landscape, enjoy outdoor education and recreation, and experience expansive views that provide a visual display between unglaciated driftless areas and lands shaped by continental glaciation.6 
The Ice Age Complex and Cross Plains and the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve 
The Ice Age Complex at Cross Plains (Complex) is a 1,700 acre site located in Cross Plains, WI, that is the national interpretive site for the Ice Age NST and a component of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve. Its project boundaries are located just south of Mineral Point Road (County Trunk S) to State Highway 14 (see attached map). The Complex will be the highly visible headquarters for the Ice Age National Scenic Trail staff and located near the Ice Age Trail Alliance’s office in the Village of Cross Plains, Wisconsin. The site will be a major visitor attraction, similar to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where the NPS and Appalachian Trail Conservancy offices are located for the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The site is within 10 miles of 30 schools and located near the city limits of Madison, Wisconsin, which has a metropolitan area population of approximately 600,000. Visitors are also expected from other major metropolitan areas including Milwaukee and Chicago, which have a combined population of over 11 million. The Complex’s General Management Plan estimates it will receive 200,000 visitors a year once fully developed.7 
The intent of the Complex is to provide visitors with interpretation of its evolution from the last glacial retreat, with opportunities to enjoy low-impact outdoor recreation. Expansive views from the site of the terminal moraine, the driftless area including Blue Mounds, and the glacial drainageway known as Black Earth Trench are vital for showcasing the unique story of the relationship between the glaciated and unglaciated areas of Wisconsin. The Complex will also provide nature immersion for nearby urban dwellers, preservation of geologic features, and a continuous route for the Ice Age NST. Current development plans include the installation of a new sustainable visitor center, new protected Ice Age NST segments, additional interpretive and recreational sites, administrative and maintenance facilities, and expansion to complete the park out to State Highway 14. 
In 2013, the National Park Service approved a General Management Plan for the Complex. Currently, there are approximately 750 acres within the park that are publicly owned. The

Complex partners — National Park Service, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, Dane County Parks, and Ice Age Trail Alliance — continue to actively negotiate with private landowners within the Complex’s project boundaries to acquire lands to complete the Park, which are purchased with federal, state, county, and private funds on a willing seller basis. Once completed, the Park will extend to State Highway 14, the site of the proposed C-HC 175-foot 345-kV transmission towers. "

Comments on the DEIS (Dec 2018) for the C-HC Project 
Overview 
The NPS previously outlined many of its concerns with the C-HC project in comments submitted in July 2018 on Chapters 1 and 2 of the Preliminary DEIS and in comments submitted in September 2018 on the full Preliminary DEIS. The DEIS has been updated with more robust information on the Ice Age NST, the Ice Age Complex at Cross Plains, and its associated resources, along with more detailed information on the cost and feasibility of the underground transmission alternative and potential adverse impacts of the C-HC project. The NPS appreciates the inclusion of this additional information. 
The Complex and Reserve described above are critical to achieving the Ice Age NST’s purpose and maintaining its significance. Several alternatives have been identified for various components of the C-HC project, including multiple potential transmission line corridors and routes that would affect the length, cost, and geography of the line. Our comments are specific to the eastern portion of the proposal (i.e., the segments encompassing the line’s eastern terminus at the Cardinal Substation in the Town of Middleton, Wisconsin; the northern alternative in western Dane County, Wisconsin, that continues west through the countryside south of State Highway

DEIS Acknowledgement of Adverse Impacts to Ice Age NST under All Action Alternatives 
The NPS notes that the RUS acknowledges in the DEIS that C-HC would cause adverse impacts to Ice Age NST under all action alternatives, including impacts to recreation and visual and aesthetic qualities. For instance, the DEIS states that “[a]dverse impacts would occur from the all [sic] action alternatives to the Ice Age National Scenic Trail and recreational users on this trail system,” and that “the presence of the transmission line would adversely impact the character of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail where there is overlap with the analysis area creating visual impacts to trail users.”13 The DEIS further states that “[a]ll alternatives would cause minor temporary and moderate permanent impacts to the Ice Age National Scenic Trail and Cross Plains Complex…The close proximity of a new high-voltage transmission line in these areas would alter the character of the trail system and impact recreational users’ experiences in these areas.”14 The DEIS also states that “[u]nder all alternatives, visual impacts to users of the Ice Age NST would occur”, and that “[a]t two [Key Observation Points], which represent important viewsheds for the Ice Age NST, major visual impacts would occur.”15 
Single Action Alternative (Segments Y and Z) in Western Dane County, WI for the Route Area Impacting Ice Age NST 
A review of the Macro-Corridor Study undertaken by the Utilities in Sep 2016 shows that only a single corridor was evaluated as part of the action alternatives for the C-HC Project to be carried forward for further analysis.16 This single action alternative forms part or all of the transmission line alternative corridor segments V, W, X, Y, and Z examined for detailed analysis in the C-HC DEIS.17 The NPS is concerned that the configuration of the single corridor option in Dane County, Wisconsin results in adverse impacts to Ice Age NST regardless of the action alternative selected.

Because of the evidence that I have presented here and the overwhelming evidence that has been presented, is being presented and will be presented by many others against C-HC, I would like to encourage RUS and USDA to refuse the loan to Dairyland Power to help build the C-HC. I believe you would lose your investment when ATC, ITC, Dairyland will have trouble paying off their obligations. Landowners, businesses, and farmers around the C-HC line, if built, will also lose in many ways as you have heard and will hear from others. Instead, I propose that you take the amount of money allocated for this loan and make it available to those folks in southwest Wisconsin for low interest loans and/or subsidies for the construction of NTA, individual solar residential and farm solar installation solutions. This way -- my last statement. This way, RUSDA would not be hurting farmers and others by contributing to hardship and struggle, but rather they would help us to succeed and prosper.

I just built a new home on it in the last two years. I also have an art business where I have a school where people come to my home and study, and we like to go out and paint the landscape. No one is going to want to come there and paint this transmission line. So all of these people are also very concerned about the environment, as am I. I grew up on a farm. My parents were -- survived the Great Depression. My dad survived the Second World War. We were dirt poor when I was a kid. I was barefooted most of the time, and my friends know I'm still barefooted a lot of the times. I'm just used to it. But I guess my belief for conservation and for the environment was instilled in me at a very young age because I was outside working. My father was really into conservation, had waterways, we had strip, hill, contour farming. This was in southeast Iowa. And I have continued to be concerned about it because I was out working in these fields for all my younger years. So when I see something that is being done that doesn't seem to be reasonable, I speak out. I have this house here. I built the house here because I love this area, and probably the reason I love it is because of the pristine wilderness almost. It's beautiful here. When we originally moved here in '83, we chose this area because of its beauty and because of the ethics of the people here; the honest, hardworking farmers that were trying to care for their farms. And I hate to see all of that work go to ruin because of something like this. "

More Detailed Information on the Methodology for the Cost and Feasibility Analysis of Underground Transmission 
The NPS appreciates the more detailed cost and feasibility analysis for underground transmission included in the December 2018 DEIS. It is not clear, however, as to how the RUS concluded that 11.4 miles of underground transmission are necessary to avoid visual impacts to Ice Age NST. For example, the line mileage from the Cardinal Substation at C-HC’s eastern terminus to the existing substation at the intersection of County Trunk Road P and Stagecoach Road, west of State Highway 14, is approximately 5 miles; undergrounding this segment could potentially mitigate the worst of C-HC’s visual impacts to Ice Age NST, but it is not possible to make this determination without more specific information on the underground transmission scenarios evaluated by RUS. The NPS therefore respectfully requests more detailed information regarding the methodology behind the cost and feasibility analysis for underground transmission, as well as more detailed information on the methodology behind its visual impacts analysis. The NPS also notes that long-distance high-voltage underground transmission is potentially technically feasible and not necessarily cost-prohibitive within the region; for example, the recently proposed SOO Green Renewable Rail project intends to construct a 349-mile 525-kV direct current underground transmission line within existing railroad corridors in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, at an estimated cost of $2.5 billion.18, 19, 20 
Viewshed Analysis and Impacts to Ice Age NST 
The NPS generally agrees with the approach taken for conducting the viewshed analysis, which evaluated worst-case conditions (i.e., bare earth analysis) and accounted for a level of vegetation screening.21 "

The NPS also notes that long-distance high-voltage underground transmission is potentially technically feasible and not necessarily cost-prohibitive within the region; for example, the recently proposed SOO Green Renewable Rail project intends to construct a 349-mile 525-kV direct current underground transmission line within existing railroad corridors in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, at an estimated cost of $2.5 billion.18, 19, 20 
Viewshed Analysis and Impacts to Ice Age NST 
The NPS generally agrees with the approach taken for conducting the viewshed analysis, which evaluated worst-case conditions (i.e., bare earth analysis) and accounted for a level of vegetation screening.21 "

I don't think we're going to have a need for these big transmission lines. My son is an electrical engineer in Seattle and he's already -- he's got a prototype on his house right now. He says that the batteries are coming within a few years that are going to be really good for this and we won't be transmitting electricity over lines, we will be able to generate it at our own farmsteads, and that will make it a lot less dependant on these big companies that don't care for us at all. I mean, this line is going to go here. It's also going through Iowa. I have farms in Iowa, too. Every one of those farms, and the farm here, I have had a solar company come evaluate what my needs would be. And the plans are all there. As soon as the batteries are developed I'll be off the grid. DIENCE MEMBER: They're all over Europe. They are developed. LINDA GRICE: So I don't see -- there is lots of farmers in Iowa that have solar arrays that are -- they are using for their whole farmsteads, so I don't see any reason to build a big line to transport energy across the country. This line -- identical lines are going through Iowa, too. They are affecting me there, also. They are affecting a lot of my friends. And even here the co-op says, and down there the co-op says that they never even asked for this line. They don't need it. They have plenty of power. We don't have outages, so why are we putting up these lines? It's lot more environmentally friendly to have our individual power and would be a lot more resilient in case of a national emergency. Some of my friends are having -- because of this line they are having windmills put up where they are going to be in the flicker shadow of it. This is just nonsense. These people have worked so hard all their lives, and I've worked hard all my life, and I would like to be able to enjoy the outdoors and enjoy being able to have my friends come over and paint with me.

The U.S. Department of Energy, November 2018, provided the following data: Non-transmission alternatives can reduce CO2 production by 50% through conservation, local power, and efficiency load management. Utility expansion with remote renewables, which lose power en route, and conversion of coal to natural gas will help lower CO2 output by 24% to 26%. So that's a big difference. Utility expansion in this case will cost customers nearly $1 billion dollars, disrupt lives and the environment, and continue to use an outmoded and inefficient transmission model.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","Background and Overall C-HC Project Need
A. C-HC Purpose and Need
Iowa has an abundant wind energy resource and accessing this resource is among the most significant
options to improve the economy and environment in Iowa, including much of rural Iowa. Given Iowa
utilities’ participating in the regional transmission operator, the Midcontinent Independent System
Operator (MISO), Iowa’s wind resource can also offer benefits to the region, including lower electricity
costs, reduced fossil fuel use, and reduced air emissions. We recognize that utilizing Iowa’s wind resource
will require the development of high voltage transmission lines. We appreciate the substantial economic
and environmental benefits that wind energy offers and recognize that additional transmission lines will
enable more wind and more of these benefits. We believe there must be a balance between the
environmental benefits of wind generation and the environmental impacts of needed transmission lines.
With a proactive and inclusive transmission planning, siting, routing, and mitigation process, we can
achieve this balance. We believe this balance has been achieved with the C-HC Project.
The C-HC Project is one of a number of Multi-Value Project (MVP) transmission lines that were
identified by MISO to meet reliability, economic, and renewable energy needs. According to MISO, the
full portfolio of MVP lines would enable significant wind generation. MISO’s initial estimate of 41
million megawatt-hours1 of wind generation enabled by the MVP portfolio has grown to 52.8 million
megawatt-hours in its latest analysis.2 The C-HC Project, also known as MVP 5, would improve the flow
and increase the quantity of renewable energy in the region. The C-HC project, similar to the whole
portfolio of MVP lines, is a critical step in the process of increasing use of renewable energy in the
region.
The status quo for electricity generation in the MISO region as a whole and particularly in Iowa and
Wisconsin, the two states where the C-HC Project is proposed, is unacceptable given the current
dominant role of fossil fuels for electricity generation and the associated adverse economic and
environmental impacts. In Wisconsin, coal accounted for 55% of electricity generation in 2017.3 Coal has
ranged from 51% to 66% over the past decade.4 Natural gas accounted for 21% of electricity generation in
2017 and has ranged from 8% to 24% in the past decade.5 Meanwhile wind energy has only grown to 3%
of Wisconsin’s total generation in the past decade and solar energy is still below 1% of all generation
sources.6 As a result, fossil fuels account for 70% to 80% of Wisconsin’s generation mix and were a
significant source of air pollutants in 2017, as in other years, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
carbon dioxide.7
Wind energy has grown significantly in Iowa in the past decade and is nearing 40% of total generation.
However, coal is still the largest source of electricity. Coal accounted for 44% of generation in 2017 and
has ranged as high as 76% in the past decade.8 Natural gas accounted for 8% of generation in 2017, up
from 2% in 2008.9 Like Wisconsin, fossil fuels in electricity generation continue to be a significant source for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide.10 The expansion of transmission in Iowa has been
an essential part of wind’s growth and ability to offset fossil fuel use in recent years. For this trend to
continue, however, the C-HC Project must be constructed.
B. Council Involvement in C-HC Project Planning
We have worked closely with utilities and transmission developers on the siting and routing of major high
voltage transmission lines in Iowa. This includes each of the four MISO MVP transmission lines
proposed in Iowa, of which the C-HC Project is one. "
"ALT02","Proposed Action","ALT","Alternatives","We appreciate ITC Midwest’s willingness to engage
with our organization, as well as our partner organizations and other stakeholders, on siting, routing, and
potential mitigation needed for the Iowa portion of the C-HC Project over the past several years. We
believe that this ongoing stakeholder engagement has improved the siting and routing of each
transmission line and has also improved mitigation projects to address issues that siting and routing could
not avoid. This is true for the C-HC Project (MVP 5) as well as MVP 3, 4 and 7.
During this process for the C-HC Project, ITC Midwest provided a number of Iowa environmental and
conservation organizations, including the Council, with study area maps highlighting identified potential
crossing options for the Mississippi River as well as the relevant substations in Iowa and Wisconsin that
must be connected by the C-HC Project. In addition to reviewing maps, our organizations had the
opportunity to visit potential Mississippi River crossing locations in-person, to submit written comments
on siting and routing options to ITC Midwest, and to meet with ITC Midwest staff on multiple occasions
to discuss the C-HC Project. The Alternatives Crossing Analysis (ACA) prepared in April 2016 and the
Macro-Corridor Study (MCS) prepared in September 2016 notes or documents some of this involvement.
Based on our extensive review, on-site visits to River crossing locations, and the final route selections for
the C-HC Project, we support construction of the C-HC Project using the utilities’ preferred route, which
we believe is consistent with “Alternative 6” as described the Draft EIS."

not avoid. This is true for the C-HC Project (MVP 5) as well as MVP 3, 4 and 7.
During this process for the C-HC Project, ITC Midwest provided a number of Iowa environmental and
conservation organizations, including the Council, with study area maps highlighting identified potential
crossing options for the Mississippi River as well as the relevant substations in Iowa and Wisconsin that
must be connected by the C-HC Project. In addition to reviewing maps, our organizations had the
opportunity to visit potential Mississippi River crossing locations in-person, to submit written comments
on siting and routing options to ITC Midwest, and to meet with ITC Midwest staff on multiple occasions
to discuss the C-HC Project. The Alternatives Crossing Analysis (ACA) prepared in April 2016 and the
Macro-Corridor Study (MCS) prepared in September 2016 notes or documents some of this involvement.
Based on our extensive review, on-site visits to River crossing locations, and the final route selections for
the C-HC Project, we support construction of the C-HC Project using the utilities’ preferred route, which
we believe is consistent with “Alternative 6” as described the Draft EIS."

And I think we're all reading about that in the press; how the country is looking at other ways of producing power and using power in a wide variety of things. So I almost see this as being an old school technology that existed a hundred years ago and is still being expanded. And I think the main reason, in my view, is that because if you can build something and get a guaranteed rate of return and you don't have to really use it that much, you would do it. And our country is filled with examples of industries that have become obsolete over time and been replaced by new technologies. And I think that's what will happen in this case, too. One final example I would like to say is that we can localize production, and we already are. I'd served in the Army for many years and I think you probably know that the military does not rely on broad scale transmission systems. They want to control that power and localize it because they can't take the risk of having one line knocked down and having the whole air base to save it. So I think that's a good example to use.

The lines developers and investors, you know, try to convince us that we need to transmit power from long, long distances for reliability, you know, I guess I would -- as a piece of evidence, I would like to refer you to the Wisconsin State Journal of just two days ago on the front page. A front page article, ""Kenosha County Solar Farm Proposed,"" and the sub headline is that the project could feature the state's first utility scale battery. And, you know, I think we've always heard that wind and solar are not going to be reliable because how do you produce power all the time with wind and solar? But battery technology is coming. It's coming fast. There is a company out of Chicago that's already got some battery installations in other states. They are proposing one for the Kenosha area. This technology for electrical storage is coming fast. And, again, they have a proposal right here in the state. So the trend is definitely toward localized energy production, renewables, wind and solar, and this power line is, as I'm reading it, a look to the -- you know, to history. My proposal to the PSC would be to put this whole project on hold. There has been a lot of engineering invested in it. Just put it on the shelf. Put it on the shelf for five or 10 years. Pull it out in five or 10 areas, see if it's needed. My guess would be it's not going to be needed in five or 10 years, or ever.

for Renewable Energy Benefiting from the C-HC Project
A. Transmission Expansion Is Essential for Renewable Energy Development and MISO MVP
Lines Were Planned for and Are Being Implemented for Renewable Energy
The RUS should more clearly recognize the strong connection between the portfolio of MVP
transmission lines and renewable energy development in the region. In Iowa, MVP 3, 4, and 7 have
moved through the regulatory process and are either under construction or have been placed into service.
As these lines have been planned and built, wind development has followed in the transmission corridors
as intended. MISO’s analysis of the MVP lines and renewable energy development also show this strong
connection between the development of transmission lines and the development of renewable energy
throughout the entire North Central region.
The below map shows the renewable energy zones in blue that were identified as areas where additional
renewable energy development would be needed and would be facilitated by the MVP transmission lines
(illustrated at a high level with dotted red lines).11 This map was published in early 2012 when MISO
finalized the basic locations of the suite of MVP lines.
The below map, published in 2017, shows where actual renewable energy development has occurred in
relationship to the zones and after most MVP lines either have been placed in service or are under
construction.12 As the map illustrates, renewable energy development is clustered around the identified
renewable energy zones and the MVP transmission lines. As MISO states, “A geospatial overlay of new
wind projects in the North/Central region observes a correlation to actual wind siting and the original
identified RGOS zones.”13 The map also indicates that very substantial wind development has occurred in
Iowa and southern Minnesota, wind resources that either require or will benefit from development of the
C-HC Project, as discussed above.
Recommendation:
The RUS should maintain and enhance the clear connection between MVP transmission lines, including
the C-HC Project, and renewable energy development in the region."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","The RUS Should Recognize that the C-HC Project Is an Essential Part of a Portfolio of
MVP Transmission Lines Intended to Expand Renewable Energy
MISO evaluated and approved the MVP transmission lines as an integrated portfolio that is intended to
work together to enable significant renewable energy development. The portfolio includes 17
transmission lines throughout the North Central region. The lines allow for the access and the transfer of
renewable energy located in renewable energy zones (as identified in the above maps) to regional
markets. The full portfolio is intended to be placed into service in order to ensure the all of the intended
renewable energy benefits are realized, as well as additional benefits such as reduced congestion. If even
one of the 17 transmission lines is not built, the goals and outcomes of the full portfolio will be
compromised. These goals and outcomes include renewable energy development as well as economic
benefits (including consumer savings) and reliability benefits.
The RUS should recognize that the C-HC project is like every other individual line in the MVP portfolio
– the C-HC Project is an essential part of the overall portfolio that is necessary for the full portfolio to
accomplish the expected benefits, including renewable energy growth, reduced energy costs, and reduced
air and GHG emissions. This analysis fits within the “Indirect effects and their significance” as required
by the federal regulations regarding environmental impact statements. See 40 CFR § 1502.16 stating that
the EIS ‘shall include discussions of … indirect effects and their significance; see also 40 CFR §
1502.8(b), which expands on indirect effects. This analysis also fits within the “Energy requirements andtheir conservation potential of various alternatives” under 40 CFR § 1502.16(e) and the “Natural or
depletable resource requirements … of various alternatives” under 40 CFR §1502.16(f).
MISO highlighted the nature of the portfolio and each line’s essential role within the portfolio in recent
testimony filed in Iowa regarding the MVP 7 line, which cross from southern Iowa into Missouri. MISO
witness Ghodsian stated that the “inability to construct a key element of the regional expansion plan,
especially a ‘backbone’ element … could result in the loss of the economic benefits … The revised plan
would likely have a negative economic impact to portions of ratepayers in the MISO footprint.”14 Witness
Ghodsian further stated that the “result of not constructing the MVP 7 project would be the inability of
the existing transmission system to reliably deliver power in support of existing renewable energy
mandates and the failure to realize other MVP benefits … without the MVP 7 project, Iowa and other
states in the MISO footprint would not receive the full set of economic benefits that is provided by the
MVP portfolio.”15
Recommendation:
The RUS should include the benefits, goals and outcomes of the full MVP portfolio – including
substantial renewable energy development, reduced air emissions, and lower energy costs – in its
evaluation of the C-HC Project need and purpose."

I lean on the side of forestry which is more ecologic, the wildlife, the critters and plants, not just trees, and I've found quite a few locations of rare plants, rare animals, and rare habitats like savannas, pine relicts, which are not in the records. Some of these have not been discovered before, some have been discovered by somebody that doesn't want their land noted in the record because they are afraid somebody might come on the land and take things and trespass. My concern about the Draft EIS is that it doesn't seem to have included any kind of inspection of the land, the rocks, proposed to find out what's actually out there. It seems to just take that which is in the records already and say, okay, well, we will pick that spot and that spot and that spot, but nobody to my knowledge has been out there to see what's there during the right time of the year so we can find out what's really out there, what their line is really going to run over and destroy, and with the spraying that you will be maintaining it, it is going to keep it destroyed.

The Upper Midwest has some of the nation’s best wind resources. The windiest areas of Iowa, Minnesota,
South Dakota (similar areas in the region) are also generally rural and at a geographic distance from the
areas that use the most power. Accessing these wind resources requires transmission development.
Without transmission development, wind energy within these windy areas cannot be moved to places
where the power is needed. Given this dynamic, there are no alternatives to transmission that would
support and facilitate development of these wind resources. The ‘non-transmission alternatives’ that the
RUS identified are more appropriately evaluated as alternatives to distribution system infrastructure,
including distribution system wires and substations, than as transmission alternatives. As such, the RUS’s
decision to not evaluate these resources in detail is appropriate. We support robust deployment of the
technologies identified by the RUS, such as distributed solar, energy efficiency, and energy storage – but
not as a substitute for accessing large amounts of wind energy from some of the best wind resources in
the U.S.
Recommendation:
The RUS should maintain in the Final EIS its approach to non-transmission alternatives in the Draft EIS

In the Draft EIS, the RUS appropriately recognizes that a major purpose of the Cardinal Hickory Creek
transmission line is to enable additions of renewable energy generation to the MISO grid.23 The RUS
identifies approximately 1,300 MW of increased transfer capability from the C-HC Project, which would
allow wind power to transfer from “wind-rich areas of the upper Great Plains to load centers like Madison
and Milwaukee.”24 The RUS identifies a set of existing wind projects that are in operation but not able to
operate at full output because of transmission constraints, which the C-HC Project would relieve.25 The
RUS also identifies an additional set of pending wind and solar projects that would benefit from the C-HC
Project if constructed.26 As discussed above, there are more wind and solar projects that would benefit
from the C-HC Project.
Wind and solar energy are zero carbon resources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a variety of
additional air pollutants by offsetting or reducing generation from fossil fuel resources like coal and
natural gas. These pollutants include nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, air toxics like
mercury, and fine particulates. Both climate change and these air pollutants directly threaten human
health and the natural environment.The renewable energy projects that will benefit from the C-HC Project will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and additional air pollutants in the region. However, the RUS does not include these
greenhouse gas reductions in its analysis of the GHG impact of the CHC project. The RUS only identifies
limited greenhouse gas increases from construction activities related to the C-HC Project27 and from the
operation of the project.28 We appreciate that the RUS views these emissions as “minor”29, but any longterm
increase associated with the C-HC Project is the result of an incomplete analysis that does not fully
account for GHG reductions from increased renewable energy.
The RUS also does not include air pollution reductions from renewable energy in its analysis of the air
pollution impact of the CHC Project. The RUS identifies emissions of CO, NOx, SOx, particulate matter,
VOCs, and HAPs from either construction or operation of the line.30 Again, we appreciate that the RUS
views these emissions increases as “small” “short-term” and “minor”31 but, like GHGs, we are very
concerned that the Draft EIS ignores the substantial air pollutant reductions from increased renewable
energy associated with the C-HC Project.
Without the GHG and air pollution reduction analyses, the Draft EIS shows an incomplete and inaccurate
picture of the C-HC Project. The RUS has unreasonably neglected some of the major expected
environmental benefits from the C-HC Project.
A more complete analysis of the GHG and air emissions reductions from the renewable energy projects
that benefit from the C-HC Project fits within the analysis required for “Indirect effects and their

climate impacts are “Indirect effects, which are caused by the action and are later in time.”32 GHG and
air emissions reductions are similarly “Indirect effects, which are caused by the action and are … farther
removed in distance.”33 Effects and impacts are “synonymous” and can be both “beneficial and
detrimental.”34 Given this framework, the RUS should account for long-term GHG and air pollution
emissions reductions from the renewable energy projects associated with the C-HC Project as well as the
reduced impacts from climate change.
MISO’s initial and ongoing analysis regarding the MVP portfolio accounts for carbon emissions
reductions from renewable energy associated with the portfolio. MISO’s initial projections in 2012 for
carbon dioxide reductions from the MVP portfolio ranged from 8.3 to 17.8 million tons annually.35
MISO’s latest analysis, from 2017, shows even greater annual reductions of 13 to 21 million tons.36
MISO is clear that this is because the “MVP Portfolio enables the delivery of significant amounts of wind
energy across the MISO and neighboring regions, which reduces carbon emissions.”37
MISO’s carbon reduction analysis is for the entire MVP portfolio and shows the scope of reductions from
the full portfolio. The RUS should use this scope as a starting point to estimate a range of reductions from
the renewable energy associated with the C-HC Project. As other commenters noted during the scoping
process, EPA’s AVERT tool38 can assist with estimating GHG as well as other air pollutant reductions
from renewable energy. The RUS can use its estimates for wind and solar capacity (existing and new) that
will benefit from the C-HC Project in the Draft EIS as a low-end renewable capacity estimate.39 We
suggest above that there are greater amounts of renewables that will benefit from the C-HC Project and
expect other commenters to do this same, which can form the basis for a middle or higher range estimate.
The RUS should use AVERT or similar tools to identify GHG and other air pollutant emissions
reductions from this range of renewable energy projects that will benefit from C-HC Project and include
these emission reductions as part of the overall GHG and air quality impact analysis.
We and other stakeholders raised these issues in our scoping comments, submitted to the RUS in January
2017. We specifically requested that the RUS evaluate the environmental benefits from renewable energyassociated with the C-HC Project, including greenhouse gases and air quality.40 The RUS neglected to
include these issues in the list of scoping comments received.41 We also request that the RUS correct this
oversight and omission when preparing the Final EIS.

In the Final EIS, the RUS should include the air pollutant and GHG reductions from wind and solar

would expect a long-term net reduction in air pollutants and GHG emissions from the C-HC Project."

We and other stakeholders raised these issues in our scoping comments, submitted to the RUS in January
2017. We specifically requested that the RUS evaluate the environmental benefits from renewable energyassociated with the C-HC Project, including greenhouse gases and air quality.40 The RUS neglected to
include these issues in the list of scoping comments received.41 We also request that the RUS correct this
oversight and omission when preparing the Final EIS.
Recommendation:
In the Final EIS, the RUS should include the air pollutant and GHG reductions from wind and solar
projects associated with the C-HC Project in its air quality and GHG impact analysis. By doing this, we
would expect a long-term net reduction in air pollutants and GHG emissions from the C-HC Project."
"AIR04","Climate Change","AIR","Air Quality","The RUS Should Recognize that Renewable Energy Associated with the C-HC Project and
Alternatives 1-6 Provides an Incremental Benefit to Mitigate Climate Change
Because the C-HC Project will benefit pending and existing renewable energy projects in the region, it
will help reduce greenhouse gas emission in addition to other air emissions. This reduction in emissions is
an incremental step in mitigating impacts from climate change. The scope and scale of those impacts in
the region is increasingly clear and concerning. The U.S. Global Change Research Program released the
Fourth National Climate Assessment (Fourth Assessment) in November 2018. This is a recent and
comprehensive assessment of current and projected climate impacts on a range of sectors and areas
related to the C-HC Project, including the Midwest region, ecosystems, air quality, and public health. The
Fourth Assessment helps identify current and projected climate impacts in the C-HC Project corridor,
including the Refuge. The Fourth Assessment also discusses the opportunities for mitigation using
renewable energy technologies as well as the risks of inaction if we fail to mitigate.
The Fourth Assessment provides a range of climate impacts for the Midwest region in particular as well
as sectors relevant to the Midwest, including ecosystems, water resources, agriculture, forests, air quality,
public health and other sectors. For example, regarding forests in the Midwest, the Fourth Assessment
states that as temperatures increase, “reduced tree growth or widespread tree mortality is expected.”42
Regarding Midwestern ecosystems, the Fourth Assessment states that “High rates of change in climate
factors like air and water temperature and increasing drought risk likely will accelerate the rate of species
decline and extinction.”43 The Fourth Assessment also recognizes significant human health impacts. In
fact, as the Assessment states, “Midwestern populations are already experiencing adverse health impacts
from climate change, and these impacts are expected to worsen in the future.” 44 (emphasis added). Air
quality is a major part of the human health impacts, with increases in ground-level ozone and particulate
matter causing or exacerbating lung and cardiovascular diseases.45 Increased daytime and nighttime
temperatures and increased flooding – including Mississippi River flooding – are both associated with a
range of worsening human health impacts. Finally, regarding the agriculture economy that is critical to
both Iowa and Wisconsin, the Fourth Assessment finds that “Projected changes in precipitation, coupled
with rising extreme temperatures before mid-century, will reduce Midwest agricultural productivity to
levels of the 1980s without major technological advances.”46
The Fourth Assessment details many additional impacts to the region and sectors highlighted above and
to other sectors important to the Midwest region. As stark as the current and projected climate impacts
are, however, the Fourth Assessment does provide guidance on avoiding impacts. The Assessment states
that, “Future impacts and risks from climate change are directly tied to decisions made in the present,
both in terms of mitigation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases …and adaptation.”47 (emphasis
added). The Assessment helps to put a focus on such mitigation efforts as “Fossil fuel combustion
accounts for 77% of total U.S. GHG emissions” 48
The Assessment repeats the importance of decisions made now on both near-term and long-term climate
impacts. The Assessment states that, “decisions that decrease or increase emissions over the next few
decades will set into motion the degree of impacts that will likely last throughout the rest of this century,
with some impacts … lasting for thousands of years or even longer.”49 In addition, “Early and substantial
mitigation offers a greater chance for achieving a long-term goal … Early efforts also enable an iterative
approach to risk management … Evidence exists that early mitigation can reduce climate impacts in the
nearer term.”50
Renewable energy has helped reduce emissions by 25% from 2005 levels in the power sector, which is
“the largest sectoral reduction over this time.”51 There remains great potential for renewable energy to
contribute to much deeper reductions in emissions. As discussed above, fossil fuels still dominate the
electrical generation mix in Iowa and Wisconsin. Pending renewable energy projects alone could change
that, while substantial potential exists to go beyond pending projects.
The risks and adverse impacts are too great for the RUS to ignore climate change in the Final EIS. The
RUS should recognize that the C-HC Project and associated renewable energy development will provide
real, incremental mitigation benefits across a range of sectors. This analysis fits within the indirect effects,
required by 40 CFR § 1502.16 and described in 40 CFR § 1508.8, including long-term effects of an action
and benefits from an action.
Recommendation:
The RUS should recognize an incremental climate benefit in many subsections of Chapters 3 and 4 – e.g.,
subsections covering vegetation, wildlife, water resources, air quality, land use, public health, the Refuge,
and more. The RUS should state that Alternatives 1-6 offer this incremental benefit and that if the
Alternative is built, the sector will see reduced risk of adverse climate impacts."

If the C-HC Project is not built – the No Action Alternative – then significant amounts of renewable

curtailments or cancellation. In the Draft EIS, the RUS recognizes this fact by stating, for example, “wind
generation currently developed, under construction, or proposed for Iowa would not be adequately served
… under the No Action Alternative. There are a number of wind generation projects in MISO that are

During the Council’s review process, we have maintained support for the two identified Mississippi River
crossing options near Cassville, Wisconsin. In the Draft EIS, these are referred to as the Stoneman
crossing and the Nelson-Dewey crossing.55 Our support for these crossing options recognized several
benefits. These benefits include the use of existing transmission right-of-way and infrastructure for the
Mississippi River crossing itself as well as the use of existing transmission right-of-way and infrastructure
for significant stretches of the transmission line outside of the River crossing, but not available if other
crossing locations were used.
We agree with the major conclusion of the ACA and MCS that the preferred crossing locations are the
Nelson-Dewey and Stoneman options. We appreciate the thorough and detailed review that was involved
in producing both the ACA and MCS. We recognize that an expanded infrastructure project, such as this
transmission line, in the Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) is a serious undertaking.
Given the thorough siting and routing analysis, the limited options for crossing outside of the Refuge, and
the broader economic and environmental benefits from expanded access to wind generation, we are
supportive of the use of the Refuge for the Nelson-Dewey and Stoneman crossing options.
In the Draft EIS, the RUS rejected other crossing options for further analysis, including Lock and Dams
in Guttenberg and Dubuque, two highway crossings in Dubuque, and a transmission line crossing in
Dubuque. We support this decision, which allows focus on the possible routes in Iowa and Wisconsin

The CHC project preferred route, which crosses the Mississippi River at Cassville, Wisconsin, was

other existing infrastructure. We encouraged and supported this approach throughout the planning
process, as did other stakeholders. This included multiple comments to ITC Midwest as well as our
comments to the RUS on the scoping for the EIS, as we discussed above.Use of existing transmission corridors reduces the environmental impact and visual impact of the CHC
project, as the RUS recognizes. The use of existing right of way for the Mississippi River at the Cassville
location, for example, is a very important step to reduce impacts on the River and the Refuge. The
Cassville crossing also enables significant use of existing corridors and right of way for much of the route
in Wisconsin, including the 138 kV transmission line from Cassville to Montfort and the use of roads and
state highway from Montfort to Mount Horeb. This quantity of existing transmission line, right of way,
and road infrastructure is not easily or at all available from other River crossing locations (e.g., Dubuque
or Guttenberg).
Our understanding is that Alternative 6 is consistent with the overall preferred route of ITC, ATC, and
Dairyland for Iowa and Wisconsin as well as the Mississippi River crossing. We have summarized the
RUS’s analysis of each alternative in the table below. We believe this summary clearly demonstrates the

And one of the earliest speakers said that he was concerned about this even though the line doesn't pass near his property. Well, the line doesn't pass near my property either and maybe not near yours but it does affect you, not just because you're going to be paying for it but because of climate change. Everybody is affected by climate change. And climate change is fueled by global warming and global warming is fueled by CO2 emissions.
And one thing I find lacking in the EIS is a real analysis of what kinds of CO2 -- increasing CO2 will be produced by all the fossil fuel energy coming into Wisconsin compared to the amount of fossil fuel energy -- compared to how much CO2 would come from the non-wire alternatives.
We know that right now if you take a good look at the track record of the other lines, seven lines that have been built, they are open lines and supposed to be able to carry any kind of energy. But the track record is that they carry a minimal amount of alternative energy.
So the argument that this is going to bring alternative energy into Wisconsin and that will reduce the impact on the environment is completely false. And the EIS statement has to take that into account. So we need to really look at these CO2 emissions.
Once the line is built, every scientific report coming out in the last 10 years by anyone with any iota of intelligence knows that the continued use of fossil fuel will continue to fuel environmental change. And once the line is built, the pressures to keep digging up that fossil fuel and sending it here is going to be tremendous. There are tremendous lobbies operating to keep coal and gas going. So we have to take that into consideration."

We have a huge solar farm going up in Cobb right near the transmission station in Montfort. We have another one that's being planned for up north. That's in the same article in the State Journal. That's going to be some of the biggest ones in the country. There is going to be more solar energy. Rooftop has increased tremendously.

I'm here to confirm the existence of the species. Its only known location has ever been found north or west of West Virginia is on what you would call a ""dam cliff"" in the Town of Arena.
Now, because of problems on that discovery by a deceased biological professor at UW Madison, a veterinary science professor, is that because of topography and access no survey for this fern has ever been made, and I think this need to be done when you have the only location for a species within the states.
Now, this specific fern is at the top of E3, and its scientific name -- it's easy enough for you to figure it out and I hope the court reporter doesn't aspirate taking this down. Aspergillum pinnat pictum (phonetic) is an endangered fern in the state of Wisconsin.
Another specific issue to the state of Wisconsin is a study on hiatus that involves a triple departmental study at UW Madison including entomology, animal science, and I believe some agency of the medical school, about the transmission of diseases to both animals and man from a mosquito that's a very specific mosquito that needs forest locations to propagate. Every year there has been a few cases of this disease around the La Crosse area. It's an encephalitic brain virus. But, again, this study is now on hiatus, but I have been in contact -- been contacted by one of the retired deans, and there may be some consideration of reinstituting this study and that requires an absolutely undisturbed forest in the Town of Arena for this study to be recommenced."

I live in Vermont Township, western Dane County, on a 267-acre farm through which would pass one of the alternative routes of Cardinal-Hickory Creek. I have never paid any attention to all these discussions about transmission lines that has been going on in the state for a number of years until I imagined the towers going across our farm and it really woke me up to the importance of these discussions. And I must admit, I have been very impressed by the degree to which the agencies have attempted to inform people like me about what's going on and what is the processes and technologies and options. It's been a very thorough and informative exercise. So I have been paying attention. Now, I've also become critical of the proposal, and I'll limit my comments to the Environmental Impact Statement to some of the areas I think need improvement. First of all, the list of steps that are proposed to mitigate environmental damages that are listed in the Environmental Impact Statement, it says this is what the companies will do to mitigate or to reduce the environmental impact's negative impacts of this construction. And I would like to see in the Environmental Impact Statement some evidence of past compliance of the companies in actually doing these mitigating promises. I mean, they look good and it's very helpful to see them, but I really would like to see some evidence, a lot of evidence, that these companies that are installing and building the line do have a good track record. So I think it would be helpful to believe what's there on the page to have some more evidence of the reliability of the companies."
"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","econdly, I was very pleased to see in the assessment the section on non-transmission alternatives; that is, comparing the building of this line, which is a transmission line, to non-transmission alternatives for meeting the same goals of reliability of congestion and provision of electricity in a cost-effective manner. That was not in the original proposals for the Environmental Impact Statement. And RUS came through our community and listened to several townships and individuals who said they would like you to include into your assessment a consideration of non-transmission alternatives for reaching the same goals as the transmission line option. And I'm very pleased to see in this impact statement a consideration of those alternatives, non-transmission alternatives. However, I think the treatment is very weak. They sort of set up alternatives that are -- well, they say that they can't reach the objectives -- the same objectives of the transmission line. And by describing them as a weak alternative is sort of like setting up a straw man. And I think they could do a much better job of talking about the distributive energy resource revolution that's going on that John Rosenbaum mentioned with these building of solar and natural gas and generation facilities that are sweeping the country. Not so much in Wisconsin yet, although certainly there are examples. But I think there ought to be a better description other than saying how many thousands of solar panels on roofs would be needed to meet the same energy requirements as transmission lines. You can do a better of job of describing the non-transmission alternatives. And particularly weak is the description of efforts to reduce the consumption and use of electricity through greater efficiencies. There is a revolution in efficiency technologies that reduce the amount of transmittable energy that's needed. And so I think the Environmental Impact Statement could do a much better job. I have reached the end of my time. I want to thank you very much."

We have a beautiful home on six acres and we've spent a lot of time and money and everything fixing it up. But now the proposed project -- and this is a picture of it so you can get a clear idea -- this would put a set of 345 kilowatt electric lines to and from 170-foot high rusty metal towers from east to west across the entire length of our property. With the proposed right-of-way directly over our garage taking out all our trees, Farmer [unintelligible] used our maple trees for one of their commercials a few years ago. It was beautiful. And now all of those are going to be ripped out and coming within 30 feet of our house. That's how close 30 feet of our house is, destroying our property value and exposing our family -- three of them children, 4, 3 and 1 -- to close proximity to a high level electromagnetic field. I'm enclosing a photo here. But families have had difficulties selling their homes along the proposed route. But this goes far beyond any ruining of any particular financial health or land scarring effects of any particular homeowner and their family. "

Guess what? He lives on 20 forested acres. This house sits in the woods. Nobody explained the clearcut concept to him which in Iowa is 250 feet. 250 feet. I talked to Mike Deutmeyer. He's a farmer, dairy farmer. 100 year farm in Dubuque County. He has been trying to install solar on his farm and can't afford it. He will have high tower lines right behind his dairy barn.
He's got young children on that farm. He can't afford that line. "

"DECI13","Objections -General","DECI","Decision Process","
I'm opposed to the proposed C-HC power line by American Transmission Company between Middleton and Dubuque."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process"," As the Dane County Board unanimously noted, this type of transmission line is not needed here. The U.S.'s electricity rates last year were 1% lower than eight year ago in 2010. Wisconsin electricity sales have been virtually flat for this whole decade. The U.S. Energy and Information Administration projects that electricity sales will drop into the 2030s due primarily to energy efficiency if they are allowed to happen. "
"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","The federal Draft Environment Impact Statement for this project admits that non-transmission alternatives along with lower voltage and underground alternatives were not carried forward with detailed analysis and submitted."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","Other than to profit ATC and to draw another line for MISO's grand diagram, the C-HC line is not needed.
ATC erroneously declares that the line is needed for three reasons: To reduce electric costs, to promote reliability, and to promote renewable energy. Each is an fallacious and, in fact, specious statement.
ATC has built six high voltage power lines in Wisconsin in recent memory in the last seven or eight years. Electricity bills have stabilized because the energy portion of the bill has decreased with less expensive natural gas and renewables, not more power lines. In fact, the cost of power lines have increased the fixed cost portion of consumer bills and C-HC would only add to that.
Regarding reliability, Wisconsin is well known for its national electrical grid reliability. The state already has some of the highest electrical reliability in the nation. We don't need more reliability for reliability's sake.
Third, regarding promoting renewable energy, this is where it really goes wrong. Renewable energy growth is hampered by inner city high voltage power lines because those HVPLs originate and terminate near very large fossil fuel plants. By building these lines, one is, in effect, institutionalizing these fossil fuel plants.
Once the HVPL line is built it will be incumbent upon the utilities to continue to operate the fossil fuel plants, not to decentralized their power generation to local distributed renewable sources. More to that point, the vast majority of electricity now carried by these power lines is derived from fossil fuels.
Importantly, all of the electricity required by southwest Wisconsin is now carried on smaller voltage lines. There is plenty of capacity by ATC's engineers' own admission for existing lines, and that is projected out 10 years. ATC has said that they can build one of
these HVPLs in three years.
If they can do that, there is obviously no urgency for erecting this boondoggle project. Even the developers of the proposed 300 megawatt solar firm near Montfort have stated that they do not need more transmission capacity.
The greater grid also has multiple routes for electrical transmission. So if you're going to say that, oh, it's not just the Driftless Area, we have other routes throughout the state that are involved here.
To clarify this point, more and larger lines won't carry more electricity because the lines only carry the electricity that is used, that is needed. It's rather like a waterline. If the demand isn't using the available water the pipe won't carry more water if it doesn't have a place to go. Many people just don't understand this point.
More high voltage power line capacity will not carry more electricity than it's demanded in the grid. The grid has plenty of current and projected future capacity. This line will not carry more renewable energy. It just won't. And I wonder why people don't seem to understand that.
ATC as greatly ramped up its capital structure to build these 20th century dinosaur towers. Now it needs to find a project, meritorious or not, to carry its capital investment and reward its stockholders. That's the need here.
So, for no legitimate reason, Wisconsin is being solicited to pay for the ATC mistake of overcapitalizing its operations so that ATC can continue to reward stockholders and chief executives.
This mistake is neither Wisconsin's doing nor its problem. I'm offended by the notion that because ATC has overbuilt its capacity the electrical consumers have to pay for it with additional unneeded power lines.
I personally approached one of ATC's executives on this point in one of the listening
sessions and he could not counter my statements. Personally, I felt sorry for him because he knew that his company proposal was shamefully flawed.
ATC has flooded the airways for the past four years that I know of and probably more with very costly promotional advertising. When asked to come to Mt. Horeb where I've met for a meeting, ATC blew off our community. If they can do that, they certainly don't
deserve to be here.
I believe the proposal is flawed."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","This is the first transmission project that the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center has opposed. This is a line that is not justified on its merits. It was thought up, I think, eight to 11 years ago and they are carrying through. "

"DECI13","Objections -General","DECI","Decision Process","A very short comment. I'm Marvin Winch from Dodgeville Township, and I received this letter from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin a few days ago. And I would like to relate to this because I'm in the area very closely affected by this proposed site, which I'm opposed to. As a nation, if the Public Service Commission does not rule in the favor of the public all this that we do is waste of time. The Public Service have got to rule in the public's favor. Otherwise, we, as a nation, we might as well revert to communism or socialism because we have no rights. So that's basically -- you know, I really enjoyed the comments of the people before me. It's real good, the Driftless Area and all the things that they said, but it's all a waste of time unless they rule in our favor. And it should be. The majority of Wisconsin is against this proposal. So that's all I have."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","First of all, if you glance through the report that is right there, you will see that a lot of those issues that the previous speaker talked about have already been discussed.  Most of these transmission areas are already in place.  They are just going to be additions, adding to it.  It is going to be rebuilt, but they are already there.  So if we haven't got an impact on the transmission lines affecting us and our property right now then I want to make sure that this isn't going to happen.  There is only one new plan right there.  So and that is from Wisconsin. "
"PUB01","General Public Involvement","PUB","Public Involvement"," 
I was very impressed that they have done so much work as opposed to when IUD pushed through the pipeline with hardly any comment or discussion and allowed eminent domain to be used for an out of state company or a group of them.  "
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","This is actually going to benefit us.  There are over ten groups, utilities that are involved in this together, so it isn't just one utility trying to rake us over the coals.  
There are projects in the works that will not go through if this does not give them a way to sell their product.  We have an opportunity in Iowa to shift from what is become kind of a failing economy to being the forefront of renewable energy economy, which we have been doing very, very well.  We were only third or so in the country not that long ago, and then the solar tariffs hit us and a few other things hit us, economy issues within the last three years of policy changes. "
"EFF04","Mitigation/Environmental Commitments","EFF","Effects Analysis","So there are possibly some eminent domain issues, but frankly the areas that they are talking about right now, if they have already done their homework and said they will protect the wildlife, they will protect and rebuild areas where the transmission lines are going, there are mentions made of protecting all of the areas that are sensitive, so I think they have done their homework and at least they have kind of had these comment periods and let us put some effort into commenting on it and reading ahead of time.  That doesn't always happen.  "

"SOCIO02","Jobs","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","So anyway, I do think that we really need for our state to be able to move forward and have some decent paying jobs.  We can't rely on the oil and gas industry.  I mean, some areas in this state are doing very well with that, with fracking sand drilling and mining, but that is a very, very small portion.  And that is way more destructive than what we are talking about here as far as I have seen, so that is all I have to say."
"ALT02","Proposed Action","ALT","Alternatives","When I look on this map and I see these purple lines, all the various possibilities of where these towers are and lines are going to go, the whole idea of my understanding is to move wind power from Iowa over to Wisconsin, to Madison probably, Milwaukee areas more specifically.  I am looking at this.  It ends at the Hickory substation.  
Now, I grant you I haven't been to every area in this section, but I don't ever see any wind turbines down there.  So somehow where is all this wind power going to go and how is it going to connect would be one question I would have at some point to this substation?  There is no wind turbines down there to really feed into this. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","Secondly, I am not interested in providing Wisconsin their power.  Why don't they setup their own wind turbines and feed into their own people.  I love Iowa.  And unlike people who say Iowa is so flat I love driving across Interstate 80.  I used to love it a lot, but when I get past Des Moines to the western section of Iowa quite frankly I am appalled at all the wind turbines.  I know it is the future supposedly.  But it is not very pretty.  And Iowa is a beautiful state so I would object just to having to look at more and more turbines in the State of Iowa. "
"SOCIO01","General Socioeconomics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics"," 
I also object to the 7 percent they want from what I understood I think you said, that the power companies, the ones that you are feeding into this, are asking for I assume the taxpayer, the state, which is the taxpayers, to also subsidize.  I don't think there should be any subsidizing if it does go through.  No taxpayer should be paying for this at all, period.  They are going to make money from it, let them make money.  You know, don't charge me for my taxes to go towards building something like that."
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources"," 
And Gina also said go about the existing ones, if they are already there or just replacing them.  I need to remind her though that they are going to be over 100 feet tall.  If you have ever been down to Peosta area over by the    the Monastery Road and seen some of the ones that they have put there, they are huge.  They are not little single.  Yeah, they might be single, but they are huge single ones.  They are not these little tiny posts, poles that we see now on the highway.  They are huge.  
And I will speak personally, my view is from Turkey Ridge over the Turkey Valley straight out to I go past Balltown.  I don't want to look at one of them.  I appreciate the pristineness of that whole area.  And I enjoy driving down towards Cassville on that road and seeing the wildlife and not having to look at these huge monstrosities of electricity."

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","A little over a year ago I tended a meeting in Dodgeville, Wisconsin where a group of people were talking about impact of high power lines on their communities.

Dairyland Cooperative has asked for a 9 percent low interest loan to fund their part of this line, about 48 million dollars or so, I am not sure.  They have not proven in my mind a need for this line for the rural people of Iowa or any of the communities in Wisconsin."
"LAND01","General Land Use","LAND","Land Use","I am tried of country people being second rate citizens. It is more the principal of farmland being used to advance urban areas under eminent domain and the area always presumed to be immune because of the terrain and special qualities it has. It is part of the driftless area. Most of the land is privately owned, so it is up to us landowners to at least try to protect it. Dubuque County is at the southern end of the driftless. Dubuque is the largest city on the Iowa side that is in the driftless. Dubuque has had its vote for the transmission line, there were alternate crossings and most of them are in Dubuque and they all they voted no in Dubuque. So again that is urban areas versus rural areas where it is going to be crossing in Millville. Just feel like we have less voices in the country."
"SOCIO08","Cost/Benefit Outcome","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","In addition to that, all of the entities involved in this line construction will receive 10.2 percent interest from Wisconsin up to 12 1/2 percent interest guaranteed return on their investment for the next forty years.

I am I have a job so it takes me a long time to have to research everything, so it is a lot easier to hire lobbyists in Washington to help. So I think you will find two articles that talked about the lifespan of wind turbines. So a paper published by The American Experience by Mitchell Roling in 2018 reads that the assumed lifespan of wind turbines to be at least thirty years. In Iowa MidAmerican Energy plans to repower turbines constructed in 2004. So it is only fourteen years after they were installed. That is less than half the life span. The report only looked at a thirty year window. They failed to account for the cost necessary to repower the wind turbines. By not factoring the initial spending, the reports underestimates the true cost of wind energy and overestimates the cost of the power plant capable of generating energy for more than thirty years. As the turbines grow older the utilization rate decreases at a rate of 1.6 percent each year, and that is and that is what requires a turbine to be repowered, just every year it produces less and less. And I also brought a paper by Rick Kelly. I think he writes for a newspaper Valley Morning Star, titled retiring worn out wind turbines could cost billions that nobody has estimates. Oh, retiring worn out wind turbines could cost billions that nobody has, and estimates tear down costs of a single turbine is at about $200,000. So an old turbine that we see, to tear that down would cost about $200,000. With more than 50,000 wind turbines in the US, decommissioning costs are going to be around ten billion. This short lifespan is rarely discussed, but yet it has massive impact on the cost of electricity for families and businesses that don't want the transmission lines or look at the ugly wind turbines. "
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","  I do have a problem, as she mentioned, with all the wind power.  I think the one, the field she is talking to, nobody here could really address that, but that is the Edgewood wind farm that they are tapping, and it is being moved all over to Wisconsin.  
So while, if it gets to be February and minus 30 degrees and middle of the night they may have to move some power back, but in general this whole line is to provide power to Wisconsin, not us.  My thinking on it is the wind farms are too distributed.  Their energy density is very low, and it would be cheaper for the companies to build a gas plant over by Madison.  
We don't have the need for all that power so but that is    that is my opinion on the whole project.  And as far as the environmental impact, yeah, you are going to have it for whatever you are going to have, you are going to have some environmental impact.  But the issue really comes down to do you want to try to capture the dispersed energy of the wind and solar and have a reliable system?  You can't do it without building the gas plants anyway, so which in other words you have got to double the cost to    to make these things reliable. "
"SOCIO01","General Socioeconomics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","I think part of the economics might be something called the production tax credit, which is another one of those government numbers that if I am not wrong it is $24 a megawatt hour right now and the wind company gets $24 if he produces the power.

It would be really interesting if some county ordinances start passing stuff that requires the landowners, because they are getting like $8,000 a year for the wind turbines on their land, when they are done who is going to remove them? Who is responsible for that cost? Are they going to be at the farmer's cost? Going to be at the taxpayers of Iowa costs? The county's cost? There are notes in the paper.

Life expectancy, like she said, is fifteen years.  After that what?  Who is going to tear them down or who is going to replace them?  
And they turnaround natural gas, they put six of them down by Marshalltown.  They had two there.  Instant right now you got your energy right now with a gas turbine.  You don't have to wait for the wind, you don't have wait for the sun.  It is right there, and we have got plenty of natural gas.  Why not go natural gas?  It is a lot more efficient and more reliability. "

There are flying squirrels in this area where we are crossing. I don't know if they are on the endangered species list, but they are here. They are not addressed in the paper, so the transmission lines won't have those protected. They have stuff about the birds. MR. LEE: Do you just have the rest of that page there to finish? MS.

"SOCIO08","Cost/Benefit Outcome","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","It would be a shame if it were spoiled with big money monopoly utility companies getting government subsidies in an area that would not benefit from ugly towers. I called the ACT company, ATC company in Cedar Rapids to see if we are going to get discounted rates at all, and we couldn't said yes he didn't say yes or no. Couldn't guarantee that we would have lower utilities. I do not want this line approved. I think that we should wait to approve this transmission line or future ones to see what research tells us for the cost benefit ratios, what they really are at fourteen years instead of thirty years. And I don't want to leave Iowa as a government subsidized energy wasteland."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process"," I have found that it is deficient and/or insufficient on many important items, and I am going to pop those off here.  ATC and ITC say that we need C HC to bring in power from Iowa.  Wrongo.  Wisconsin doesn't need any more power.  We produce our own power.  We actually produce 15 percent more power than you need, and that as you know is due to flagged or declining rates, decreased efficiency and also increased individual solar residential and farm installations.  We do not need a C HC to bring power to Wisconsin.  We don't need it.  
Now, some of our folks were up in the Guttenberg meeting last Friday, and those folks up there in Clayton County and Dubuque County are mad as hell at Wisconsin because ITC told them that the C HC was needed there.  They don't want the    C HC line was needed there to bring power into Wisconsin.  Is that right?  Well, we don't want any Iowa power, we don't want your power, cotton picking Iowa power.  We don't need it.  Okay.  Keep it."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","Point No. 2, electric companies say that we need C HC to replace old, outdated electrical grid.  This is more fake news.  I called up Alliant Energy to ask them about this because I saw great equipment where we are.  Our grid, they said that our grid is in excellent shape, it is robust and resilient, we have excess capacity for present and future.  There is no C HC needed here.  Alliant did a great job when we had that polar vortex 35 below.  Thank you Alliant.  
Power companies also say that oh, your power rates are going to go down.  Wrongo.  They are going to go up, at least 10 percent, maybe 25 percent I have heard.  That is documented, that is out there.  Property values are going to go down though, I can tell you that.  
So the DEIS we were talking about here does not talk about any NTA alternatives such as solar, individual solar for homes and farms.  Solar that is produced and consumed and stored locally is increasing rapidly in Wisconsin.  I have heard a number, ten years our solar or in ten years the individual solar will decrease commercially by about 65 percent.  So we do not need this extra energy from wind turbine farms.  Wind turbine farms are inefficient, they are outdated, they are obnoxious.  And we don't need commercial solar fields like the one in Badger Hollow where you are taking up thousands of acres of prime farmland in this country.  Ridiculous."

We are in a period right now very similar to where the cigarette companies were when the cigarette companies forty or fifty years ago, what did they say?  Cigarettes are fine for you.  No problem.  Guess what, ten years later they did    or after ten years of research, good research I know what they found.  Cigarettes cause cancer.  And you know what happened then, lawsuits.

My sisters and I are now the property owners, and our hope is to keep the farm in the family.  
Our farm, like many in this area, is largely untillable.  We have an 80 acre cornfield that has been rented to the same family for crop production for the past fifty years.  The Grant River runs through the middle of the farm, and the remainder of the acreage is wooded bluffs along the river.  We also have a tributary that feeds into the Grant.  The farm is enrolled in the Wisconsin Forest Management Program, and we will be having our first sustainable timber harvest within the next two years.

I live near Dubuque, Iowa in Wisconsin, but I was living in Dubuque, Iowa when Cardinal Hickory Creek was proposed to go through Dubuque, Iowa and Dubuque said no. No, we don't want it. I was shocked a year ago to find out that this line was still alive and that it was going through the heart of the driftless area and the national wildlife refuge, and I wanted to know why it was so important to do so. So I went to several meetings and I started to read everything I can get my hands on, and I have now gone through about four boxes reams of paper and so many confusing facts and figures, I don't even know where to stop or start. I have also with Gloria Belkin and another woman, Chris, we have driven most of the line. We have talked to all kinds of people at the Grant County Fair. I have talked to landowners in Clayton County, Dubuque County. I have walked those farms. I have looked at water sheds. I have talked to those people. And like was said earlier, the folks in Guttenberg think it is Wisconsin who is pushing for the line. What I have also talked to are people who have property in Wisconsin that have a line going through their views, an artist who needs that scenery for her business. She also has a home south of Iowa City where one of these lines went through that area, and now there is 171 kV line proposed that will go through her yard basically right by her house there. 365 kV lines support additional transmission growth.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","Hi. My name is Linda Grice, and I lived in this area for a while back from '82 to '93. And I love this area and I have come back last year, built a house here, and low and behold this power line is coming through almost in my backyard and I didn't realize about that. It is over in Liberty Township. And I operate an art business that requires that I have good views. People come from actually all over the world, all over the United States for sure to paint at my place, and they are not going to come to look at a power line. I am opposing the construction of this line because I don't feel it is necessary. Local and state electric needs are being met currently. I have talked to people around that have talked to their utilities and I have talked to my utilities, and we were all told that it is not necessary. They have plenty of power. And they say that ITC came to them and wanted to put the line in. It wasn't the other way around. And they are just as happy without it. So I think we can go without it. This benefits the states to the east of us, yet we pay for it. We are paying as taxpayers and we are paying as rate payers. We are also going to be paying an increase in electric bills, the 26 percent the last speaker was talking about. Plus I am on a co op, and I also open property in Iowa and both places these co ops are the same where they discourage you putting in solar because if you if you produce so much solar and put it back on the line you get 25 percent of what they are going to charge you five minutes later when you need it back, so if you need it back in the middle of the night and you gave it to them five minutes before that it is you just pay extra for it. And the main thing is the new technology that is being developed makes this completely unnecessary. My son is an electrical engineer. He lives in Seattle. He has got a prototype of a solar system on his house where he is making $3,000 back at the end of the year. If the government is going to pay these companies 65 percent or whatever it is that they are paying for to subsidize them, why don't they pay that to us taxpayers and us rate payers?"

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","nd I several years ago in a totally unrelated setting I was with a group of people, and one of the guys was an engineer with the power company.  And he just had, it was a conference, and we just had a side conversation during this conference and he was talking about the grid and the age of the grid, and this was already like ten years ago.  
And he just mentioned that, you know, the grid in the United States is aging quickly.  He said it was already getting to the point where we needed some major revamps, major investments, and we haven't done a whole lot of that.  And I believe that we definitely need projects like this.  This is going to not only help with transmission but it is also, you know, if you look at the EIS it does talk about how it helps with the different forms of electricity that can be generated.  So this gives us flexibility with solar, with wind.  
I don't know if you ever travel out to South Dakota or North Dakota, but you will notice up there that there is not very many wind generators.  Whether you are for that or not, the reason they don't have those is because they don't have a very good grid up that way.  We have got a lot of wind generation in Iowa, and the reason we are able to have that is because we have got a pretty decent grid here in this area.  So I think having an environmentally friendly system like wind generation and solar generation and having something to hook that    hook into those types of clean energy is great, and this is going to give us some flexibility to make that happen.

One large tree can lift up to 100 gallons of water out of the ground and discharge it into the air a day.  One large tree can supply a day's supply of oxygen for four people.  Trees can help our soil remain healthy by reducing soil erosion and by creating a soil climate suitable for microorganisms to grow.

The current DEIS does not quantify CO2 emission impacts associated with using the transmission line options or substantiate transmission builders’ claims of only potential environmental benefits.  In contrast a Non-Transmission Alternative investment in energy efficiency, load management and distributed solar guarantees CO2 reductions and significant energy savings with minimal, negative environmental impacts. Request: In the Final Environmental Impact Statement, compare the 40-year, CO2 impacts from the three alternatives: CHC, the Low-Voltage Alternative, and the Non-Transmission Alternative under modest, zero and negative growth in energy use.

Alts 1‐3 make an elbow turn on our property and run for about 1.2 miles along the entire north and west sides of our farm. The tall towers (150‐170 feet) would be highly visible from our farmhouse and buildings. Our farm is located in the Pleasant Ridge area, which has some of the highest hills in Southwest WI. The altitudes of the hilltops on our farm are 1,000‐1,100 feet and the CHC line would run across those hilltops and be highly visible not only from our buildings but for miles beyond our farm. Blue Mounds, the Plain Hills, Baraboo Bluffs, and Dodgeville and Ridgeway villages can all be seen from our hilltops. Our land has the high hills, sharp rocky cliffs, and deep valleys that are characteristic of the Driftless Region. "

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","On p. ES‐4, Section 1.7.3.1, the report states that socioeconomics was a key issue identified during the RUS public scoping process. Table ES‐1 shows that the RUS received more comments about socioeconomic concerns than any other issue. When discussing the CHC socioeconomic impacts in the lengthy report, the RUS repeatedly states that socioeconomic impacts would be minor or short‐term and mitigated by compensation provided to land owners (p. ES‐16). The table on p. ES‐19 compares the socioeconomic impacts for the 6 alternative routes and states that there would be positive impacts to employment and income that would range from temporary spending of $480,937,254 (alt 1) to $568,612,262 (alt 4). That table also indicates that the number of residences whose property values would be directly impacted ranged from (2 in alt 1, 2 & 3 to 9 in alt 4). Given these statistics for income (very high) and number of residences affected (very small), we read the rest of the report carefully, searching for the definitions and data that would substantiate those RUS estimates. Our initial reaction upon seeing these statistics was that the RUS was overstating its case because it believes that the CHC line is needed and should be approved. Section 3.12 states that the “socioeconomic characteristics used to describe the affected environment include population and demographics, housing, employment sectors, tourism and property values.” Subsequent sections describe the indicators for each of these characteristics. Section 3.12.1 (p. 366) has a paragraph stating that “property owners near the proposed project may have the perception that their homes will diminish in value because of project implementation, the actual loss of property value and potential impact can only be tested through data from home sales.”"

value before this project was started. We have been told by ATC personnel that the
payment for an easement on our property will compensate us for any loss in value of our
property (We will only get compensation for the width and length of the easement, not the
entire property). At this time, we will be unable to get an accurate property valuation of our
total 20 acres that reflects the value in a normal market. We believe ATC will make
easement offers to us based only on the decreased property value of the easement taken.
Our entire property will suffer a decrease in value.
This taking of our land for this 345 Kv power line will be a huge loss of our financial

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","The report then cites two studies ‐ (Kennard and Dickey 1995) and (Wolverton and Bottemiller 2003) to support that statement. It states that conclusions should only be drawn from studies that use reliable data (ideally before/after pertinent events) and methodologies as the RUS paragraph states. That is certainly true but the report does not provide the citation for those two studies. Therefore, we could not assess the methodologies used in those studies. However, we did find a couple of later studies by Bottemiller and Wolverton (“The Price Effects of HVTLs on Abutting Homes,” The Appraisal Journal 81, no. 1 (Winter 2013): 45–62 which concluded that high voltage transmission lines (HVTLs) did have negative impacts on suburban home prices in Portland (538 homes) and Seattle (568 homes). The greatest effect was on high‐end homes (estimated negative effect of 11.23% versus 2.4% overall). A study by Sims and Dent concluded that proximity to towers and visibility of them had negative effects on property values in Scotland. That study looked at effects on 620 properties (“HVTLs in the UK,” in Towers, Turbines and Transmission Lines: Impacts on Property Value, ed. Sandy Bond, Sally Sims, and Peter Dent (West Sussex, UK: Wiley‐Blackwell, 2013), 55–79). A study of how property values changed in Wellington, New Zealand, from 1989 to 1995 found that property values were deflated by HVTLs but increased in areas where towers were removed. A 2017 article in The Appraisal Journal by Anderson, Williamson, and Wohl (The effect of high voltage overhead transmission lines on property values) reviewed literature on HVTL impacts since 2010, and concluded that further studies are needed before definitive conclusions could be drawn re. impacts of HVTLs on property values. We are also skeptical about the definitions and measures used by the RUS to assess the impacts of other socioeconomic indicators before it concluded that the CHC would only have minor and short‐term socioeconomic effects on the Driftless region. "
"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","From DEIS Section 3.12.2.3.5, Property Values: Studies cited seem
to have been conducted in urban and suburban landscapes, very different from the rural
landscape of Southwest Wisconsin. The studies cited contradict a study cited in a Wall
Street Journal article as well as the presentation given by Kurt Kielisch and the testimony
of a landowner in Ridgeway (at the Iowa County Board Meeting) who has been trying to
sell his property for over a year There are gaps here including: what the impact of the lines
would be on rural property land values, the impact on organic farm values and artisan
cheesemakers’ businesses, and on landowners for whom their properties are their
retirement fund."
"SOCIO02","Jobs","SOCIO","Socioeconomics"," Because the population throughout most of the Driftless region is relatively sparse, the RUS sees little future impact on population growth and settlement. It also sees little impact on housing because its indicator, the number of workers who will be hired during the construction period (170 workers) will move temporarily to the region or commute from neighboring areas. The RUS argues that those workers will have a short‐term positive impact because they will be union workers that receive relatively high salaries ($70,000‐$150,000) and some of that money will be spent locally. The RUS points out that there will be positive income impacts for each city, village, town, and county because they will receive an upfront impact fee and annual payments thereafter (p. 369). "

"SOCIO01","General Socioeconomics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Given the definitions and measures used, we think it is incorrect for the RUS to claim, as it does throughout its report, that the CHC HVTL will have minimal or only short‐term negative impacts on all of the socioeconomic measures (population, employment, tourism, environment, and property values). The definitions used to draw these claims are very narrow, which makes it easy for the RUS to draw those conclusions. For instance, the RUS report concludes that the number of residences likely to be impacted by the CHC are small in all six areas. But the definition is very narrow, namely it only counts as impacted the # of residences located within 75 feet of the center of the CHC line and the number located within 150 feet of that line. Using that narrow definition, according to the RUS there would be no negative property impacts on our farm even though the CHC line makes an elbow turn on our land and runs across our land for an estimated 1.2 miles.

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Given that our land is in the Driftless region and has some of the highest hills in SW WI, the line would mainly be running across our hilltops and be highly visible not only to us but to neighbors for miles around. It is impossible to believe that potential buyers will be willing to offer us the same price for our land as they would now or in the future if the Northern route is selected. It is also hard to believe that we would be adequately compensated for the estimated agricultural loss that our farm would incur given the fact that the CHC line would cross most of our hilltop fields.1 If we and other landowners do not want to sell our land but keep it in for future generations to enjoy, a government agency cannot fully compensate us and our family for that loss. My wife’s paternal great grandparents purchased farmland in Wyoming Township in 1864 and her paternal grandfather purchased our current farm in 1911. Her father was born and raised on our farm, as was my wife. Given these deep family roots in this part of SW WI, we do not want to sell our farm and we do not want to see this pristine farmland despoiled by unsightly HVTL towers. We want future generations to enjoy this landscape as Mary’s family has done for over a hundred years. Money can never compensate us for the economic, social and psychological loss that would occur if the CHC line is situated on our land. Nor do we believe that it would be in the public interest to construct a HTVL that cuts across miles of the Driftless region’s hills and valleys"

"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Because the Driftless hills and valleys are not ideal for today’s agricultural technologies, which favor the flatter terrain that characterizes agriculture production in other parts of the rest of the Midwest (e.g. Iowa), farming in this region has shifted toward organic farming which requires labor‐intensive inputs and, therefore, can be done on smaller landholdings. Organic farmers, in particular, will be negatively impacted by the proposed CHC line because voluminous amounts of herbicide will be required to keep the 150‐foot corridors free of trees, brush, and noxious weeds. Although we were told at one of the RUS Scoping Sessions that landowners can request that herbicides not be used on their properties, if they are used on neighboring properties, land can still be impacted by herbicides because of the spread of pollen and groundwater seepage into underground reservoirs and springs."

My wife Nancy has multiple sclerosis (MS) and the presence of EMF from the line will be very close to where we spend the most time outdoors: a 20 year old vegetable garden area and groomed walking paths as part of Nancy's MS therapy that now fall well within this proposed R/W. These paths are in very close proximity of the center line of the proposed power line. The unknown or questionable effect of the EMF from the 345kv line is a major source of growing anxiety for both of us. We are very concerned about the potential elevated levels of EMF exacerbating her MS. Her neurologist stated EMF information is in its infancy with little studies or examples available but that it's probably not the healthiest of environments. When we discussed our concerns regarding EMF to an ATC Local Relations Consultant, we were told that ""maybe the EMF will make her MS better."" This is unbelievable that we were told this as if there were some basis that would support this statement.

These large migrating birds that have been following the same landmarks for their trip north and back south for centuries. They also fly at night and have no way to detect the power transmission wires. They have a large wingspan and cannot change direction quickly when encountering new obstacles in their path that are about 160 feet over the land. They will collide with the transmission wire, and will not survive the encounter. There will be thousands of these migrating birds flying through this area that will not survive.

"WLDLF02","Migratory Birds","WLDLF","Wildlife","NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THREATENED SPECIES OF BIRDS IN THE MISSISSIPPI FLYWAY

Many threatened and at risk bird species rely on the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge near Cassville, Wisconsin. If high power lines are built to cross the 1.6 mi. span of the river and surrounding areas, there is little doubt that many will be injured or killed. It is estimated that 40% of all North American migrating waterfowl and shorebirds use this route every year. 

A study in 2014 (Loss et. al.) found that between 12 and 64 million birds are killed each year at U.S. power lines, with between 8 and 57 million birds killed by collision and between 0.9 and 11.6 million birds killed by electrocution. Indeed, according to the power industry itself,  birds are a major problem for utilities, because of the frequency with which power lines cause avian collisions. T & D World, the trade magazine for electric power-delivery systems, lists eagles, red-tailed hawks, great-horned owls, all juvenile raptors, herons, cranes, swans and pelicans as especially vulnerable to electrocution.

Thus, the populations of many of the species that use this route are in danger. For example, Audubon states it is currently focusing intensive conservation efforts on twenty-seven bird species along the Mississippi Flyway, including a variety of shore birds, warblers, sparrows, bobolinks and the Eastern meadowlark. Citing power lines in this highly sensitive area creates an environmental crisis for these species that simply cannot be ignored.

NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BIRD SPECIES FROM COLLISSIONS WITH HIGH POWER TRANSMISSION LINES IN THE DRIFTLESS AREA 

Along with birds who use the Mississippi Flyway, the construction of 345 kilovolt transmission lines running 100-125 miles from the Mississippi River to Middleton puts thousands, if not tens of thousands, of birds at risk. Not only would migrating birds be killed or badly injured by power lines in the flyway, but so would members of species that feed and nest in the area. Based on all available evidence, it is undeniable that vast numbers of birds will be killed if these power lines are constructed. "

NEGATIVE EFFECTS DUE TO THE DISRUPTION OF THE ECOLOGY OF THE AREA

The area impacted by the CHC plan has been carefully studied by several entities with expertise in wildlife conservation, including the WI DNR, which updated its Wisconsin Wildlife Action Plan in 2015. We know from that work, and the work of wildlife organizations like the Wisconsin Bird Conservation Initiative, that there are many threatened or endangered birds that are dependent on undisturbed land in SW Wisconsin, land that would be degraded or disturbed by the CHC. For example,

Bald Eagles have been found to nest in abundance along the route of the proposed CHC, according to the Wisconsin Breeding Birds Atlas. Endangered Loggerhead Shrikes, as well as threatened species like hooded and cerulean warblers, Henslows sparrows and Acadian flycatchers breed in the area that would be profoundly disrupted by the CHC. Many other species of concern who nest along the proposed route would be negatively impacted, including whip-poorwills, nighthawks, red-headed woodpeckers, bobolinks and dickcissels."

"WLDLF03","Habitat Fragmentation","WLDLF","Wildlife","NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION AND THE EDGE EFFECT

 Fragmented forests not only favor edge species rather than those who need undisturbed and continuous forest cover, they also increase weather extremes and increase songbird mortality. According to Murcia (1995) and Laurence (2000), edge effects reduce habitat quality and the functional connectivity between them.

Many bird species in the area rely on the kind of continuous forest cover that is rarely found except in areas like the unique geological area, The Driftless. The waterways, valleys, and stone croppings that comprise the Driftless area create an environment in which many deep forest speciesincluding birds like black-throated blue warblers, Canada warblers, golden-winged warblers, prothonotary warblers, wood thrushes and ovenbirds thrive. All of these birds would be negatively affected, exacerbating the continuing decrease of populations of song birds all around the country.

In addition, Ortega & Capen (2002) discussed findings that nest predation and parasitism by cowbirds increased along forest edges, leading to declines in songbirds who require undisturbed and unfragmented forests. Conservation groups, like the WI Bird Conservation Initiative, have worked for years to conserve habitat for endangered, threatened and rare bird species, but this work would be destroyed by the large scale destruction and maintenance of a 100-125 mile long corridor.

 There are other negative implications of the edge effect, not the least of which is the creation of a virtual corridor for the transmission of CWD. According to the WI DNR, CWD is most prevalent in western Dane/Eastern Iowa County along with another area in southeastern WI along the Illinois border. Deer are a classic edge species, and creating a 100-125 mile highway for them is a perfect prescription to increase the prevalence of this serious disease.

NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OTHER MAMMALS 

Several threatened and rare mammals are at risk from the habitat degradation that is inevitable with the construction of this project. Bats are particularly vulnerable, including the state-threatened big and little brown bats. Ground living mammals like Franklins ground squirrels live in the area and have been found to be declining, as are prairie voles and woodland voles. Badgers, that iconic Wisconsin ground dweller, is rarely seen now, but appears to hold out in some areas of the state, including SW Wisconsin. As a species they appear to do poorly around human disruptions, and there is little doubt that this project would decrease their numbers even more.

"HAS01","General Public Health and Safety","HAS","Public Health and Safety","NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF POWER LINE MAINTENANCE AND HERBICIDE USE

The use of herbicides like Roundup to maintain open corridors for power line maintenance should be a great concern to anyone with an interest in environmental and human health. Although there is still a great deal of research to be done, The World Health Organization has classified one of its ingredients, glyphosate, as probably carcinogenic in humans. By itself, glyphosate has been shown to increase risk of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Schinasi & Leon 2014) and to be toxic to aquatic life by the European Chemicals Agency. Some studies have found no correlation between glyphosate and the occurrence of other human cancers, however, it is critical to note that most studies have used glyphosate not in the form in which it is used (as Roundup, for example) but as an isolated chemical. And yet, the inert ingredients in Roundup have found to be not inert at all, especially when interacting with glyphosate. For example, polyoxyethylene alkylamine, an inert ingredient in Roundup, was found to be 2,000 times more toxic when mixed with glyphosate than lower doses of glyphosate only (see the Intl Journal of Environmental Research and the Institute of Science in Society (2014). These substances act as endocrine disruptors, which means that they can affect reproductive health and create severe developmental deficits in mammals and amphibians. There are no small numbers of amphibians who would be negatively effected by the power lines, especially some species of frog (pickerel frogs and Blanchards cricket frog to name a few)."

"HAS01","General Public Health and Safety","HAS","Public Health and Safety","HUMAN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALTH WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CONSTRUCTON AND THE PRESENCE OF THE LINES

Nature Deficit Disorder is a term coined by Richard Louv, the author of Last Child in the Woods. It describes the value of time spent in nature on mental and physiological health, while it decries the decreasing time that American children spend in peaceful, natural settings, like the areas which would be negatively impacted by the proposed high-power transmission line. Time spent in natural settings has been found to be essential to healthy cognitive and psychological function. For example, Wells (2000) found that enhanced executive function in children (an important aspect of decision making, was the result of direct experience with nature. Time in undisturbed natural surroundings has also been found to reduce stress (Wells 2003). Burdette and Whitakers study (2005) showed that important social behaviors like self-discipline and self-regulation were increased after time spent in natural settings.

These are not trivial findings, and have been replicated many times over. And they are important: Rates of anxiety and depression are not only on the rise in our country, but are at epidemic levels according to some. Anxiety is the leading mental health issue among young people (see for example, Bitsko et. al., June 2018), and yet standard treatment is often not effective or available to many. However, we know that time spent in peaceful, undisturbed natural settings has a profound effect on anxiety, as well as a buffer of the kind of stress that many of us experience every day."

"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Property Values covered in Section 3.12.2.1:

 

This section seems to underplay the impact of the lines on property value, again by only considering properties within 150 feet of the line. It implies that property owners are overreacting: “While it is possible that property owners near the proposed project may have the perception that their homes will diminish in value because of project implementation, the actual loss of property value and potential effects can only be tested through data from home sales.” However, it notes that the required data are unavailable so it “assumes that the proposed transmission line could reduce property values from 0% to 20% within 150 feet of the ROW centerline, but that the impact would decrease over time. Therefore, impacts to property values within 150 feet of the ROW centerline under all action alternatives are expected to be moderate in the short term and minor in the long term.”

 

This section is full of assumptions, so could just have easily been written to assume that property values will be much more affected. I used to work in real estate, and can say from that experience that if people have options, they will choose the property with the best views over any that would be looking at high voltage transmission lines, and they will consider long distance views as much as anything that is within 150 feet of their property."

"ALT01","General Alternatives/Range of Alternatives","ALT","Alternatives","INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW The American Transmission Company (“ATC”), ITC Transmission (“ITC”), and Dairyland Power Cooperative (“Dairyland”), collectively (“Applicants”), are requesting funding and various federal regulatory approvals to construct a huge high-voltage electricity transmission line and 17-story tall towers through the scenic and ecologically sensitive Driftless Area of southwest Wisconsin. The Rural Utilities Service’s (“RUS”) responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) require the agency to conduct a full and fair analysis of the need for the proposed transmission line to serve public, not private, purposes, and if there is a compelling need, “to explore and evaluate whether there may be reasonable alternatives to that action that may have fewer or less significant negative environmental impacts” and “take into account factors such as economic and technical feasibility.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.13. This analysis must be thorough, detailed, and based on science “in order to make better decisions based on an understanding of the environmental consequences of proposed actions, and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the quality of the human environment.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.1(a). These requirements are critical to ensure the Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) “provide[s] a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and … inform[s] the appropriate Agency decision maker and the public of reasonable alternatives to the Applicant's proposal, the Agency's proposed action, and any measures that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.151(a). RUS cannot and should not merely go through the motions. The RUS must fully and fairly consider all reasonable “alternatives to the proposed action.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(c)(iii). When a federal agency prepares an Environmental Impact Statement, it must consider “all reasonable alternatives” in depth. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14. No decision is more important than delimiting what these “reasonable alternatives” are. That choice, and the ensuing analysis, forms “the heart of the environmental impact statement.” 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14. Simmons v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 120 F.3d 664, 670 (7th Cir. 1997)."

It frames the problem that needs to be solved and defines the range of possible alternatives to be fully evaluated. The purpose and need must therefore be written broadly enough not to foreclose reasonable alternatives. As explained in Simmons v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 120 F.3d 664, 666 (7th Cir. 1997),1 a federal agency must consider “all reasonable alternatives” in an Environmental Impact Statement, and “[n]o decision is more important than delimiting what these ‘reasonable alternatives’ are. . . . To make that decision, the first thing an agency must define is the project’s purpose. . . . The broader the purpose, the wider the range of alternatives; and vice versa.” See also City of Bridgeton v. FAA, 212 F.3d 448, 458 (8th Cir. 2000) (“In reviewing the FAA's selection of FEIS alternatives, we properly look at whether the agency defined the project's purpose in terms so unreasonably narrow as to make the FEIS ‘a 1 Almost all of the proposed transmission line will travel through Wisconsin, which is in the Seventh Circuit. foreordained formality.’”) (quoting Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, 938 F.2d 190, 196 (D.C.Cir.)). The EIS must include a solution-neutral purpose and need statement, so that alternatives are not eliminated simply because they are different from the proposed project. Simmons, 120 F.3d at 666. RUS cannot adopt a limited purpose and need that acts as a “self-fulfilling prophecy” for this particular proposed transmission line and that effectively precludes full and fair consideration of all reasonable alternatives.

Finally, the document makes little attempt to measure the purported need for the line. Is it a “nice to have” or a dire need? Without having some measure of the need it is impossible to compare it with the economic and environmental cost of the line. "
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","An agency violates NEPA if it simply adopts as its own the developer’s purpose in seeking approval for the particular project. National Parks Conservation Ass’n v. Bureau of Land Management, 606 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2010). The six-point purpose and need statement adopted by the DEIS is as follows: •	Alleviate congestion that occurs in certain parts of the transmission system and thereby remove constraints that limit the delivery of power from where it is generated to where it is needed to satisfy end-user demand; •	Expand the access of the transmission system to additional resources, including 1) lower-cost generation from a larger and more competitive market that would reduce the overall cost of delivering electricity, and 2) renewable energy generation needed to meet state renewable portfolio standards and support the nation’s changing electricity mix; •	Increase the transfer capability of the electrical system between Iowa and Wisconsin; •	Reduce the losses in transferring power and increase the efficiency of the transmission system and thereby allow electricity to be moved across the grid and delivered to end-users more cost-effectively; and • Respond to public policy objectives aimed at enhancing the nation’s transmission system and to support the changing generation mix by gaining access to additional resources such as renewable energy or natural gas-fired generation facilities. DEIS at 11. The DEIS improperly adopts the developers’ purpose and need, as laid out in their now-outdated “Alternatives Evaluation Study” from 2016. As can plainly be seen, the purpose and need statement is not solution-neutral, but is drafted for the most part so that only a transmission line from Iowa to Wisconsin could meet the specified need. RUS’s third identified “purpose,” for example, is to “[i]ncrease the transfer capability of the electrical system between Iowa and Wisconsin.” DEIS at 11. Only a new or upgraded transmission line could meet this “purpose,” because it actually presents the developers’ preferred solution, rather than identifying a need. By framing the need in a transmission-specific way, RUS has directly contravened NEPA’s command that agencies adopt broad, solution-neutral purpose and need statements: [A]n agency may not define the objectives of its action in terms so unreasonably narrow that only one alternative from among the environmentally benign ones in the agency’s power would accomplish the goals of the agency’s action, and the EIS would become a foreordained formality. Nor may an agency frame its goals in terms so unreasonably broad that an infinite number of alternatives would accomplish these goals and the project would collapse under the weight of the possibilities.

Furthermore, the purpose and need statement makes several unsupported assumptions.

The DEIS suggests that there may be reliability issues in Wisconsin due to the closures of the Nelson Dewey and Stoneman power plants in 2015. DEIS at 16. Yet Wisconsin was ranked seventh in the nation for power grid reliability based on data from 2016.2 The DEIS claims that there is a “need to bring electricity from more remote generation sources to maintain local electric service.” Yet two years after the closure of those plants, in 2017, the then-Chairwoman of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission stated that “[r]ight now, there’s not a need for a lot a new generation of any source in Wisconsin . . . [w]hether it be wind, solar, coal or natural gas. The current fleets are doing well to serve the load that's necessary.”3 Furthermore, as explained in DALC’s scoping comments, the electricity demand in southwest and central Wisconsin, and much of the rest of the Midwest, is flat or declining. DALC Scoping Comments at 10–11 (Jan. 4, 2017). Moreover, instead of serving a public purpose, the claimed “need” and “purpose” here is directed much more to satisfy the private economic desires of privately-owned transmission businesses seeking to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars of profit and private energy businesses generating electricity in markets with a surplus of power that are looking to use the transmission line to sell their power to other parties somewhere to the east.

Existing easements are the easiest to expand and acquire and the most difficult for property owners to contest.  This process leaves property owners subject to accepting reasonable offers based on current ""market value"" of square footage or acreage being taken.  This however, ignores completely the fact that a large transmission line of this type adjacent to a residence or on the property has historically reduced property values by up to 45%.  This is not a wooden pole low voltage line that exits in our communities currently.  Many people will not even consider acquiring property near, or as is the case with this  proposal, adjacent to the buildings/homes.  There is an inordinate financial burden on individuals whose property is taken for what will be comparatively small easement payment. If individuals do purchase these properties it will be because they are deeply discounted to pre-transmission line construction values. This means property owners on the route, many of whom will not be compensated anything because they are  very close but not in the easement zone, will bear a hidden cost of construction for the benefit of the enterprise building the transmission line.

First, the proposed line would be an open-access line that would carry electricity from a mix of generation sources, certainly not only renewable resources. Second, this “need” ignores how many RPS standards are actually written and the current state of renewable energy credit markets. Wisconsin, for example, met its RPS standard in 2014 and continues to easily meet the 2 Energy Rankings: Measuring States' Energy Infrastructure, U.S. News & World Report (2018), https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/infrastructure/energy. 3 Chuck Quirmbach, Manitowoc-Based Wind Tower Manufacturer Wants To Sell More In Wisconsin, Wisconsin Public Radio (Jan. 18, 2017), http://www.wpr.org/manitowoc-based-wind-tower-manufacturer-wants-sell-more-wisconsin. requirements. Illinois revised its RPS standard in 2016 to prioritize renewable generation within Illinois, and renewable energy from non-adjacent states, such as the Dakotas and Minnesota, would not even be eligible for compliance. (Wind power from Iowa would have to satisfy public interest factors in order to meet the Illinois RPS standard.) Furthermore, Iowa’s largest utility, MidAmerican, has shifted from selling the renewable energy credits that it generates from its extensive wind farms to retaining these credits and retiring them on behalf of its own customers. Importantly, if electrons from a renewable facility are transported through the proposed line, but the corresponding renewable energy credits are retained by the generator, the purchaser or recipient of the electricity cannot make a claim to the renewable nature of the power. Michigan is well on its way to meeting its own RPS, Indiana does not have an RPS in place, and Ohio has severely cut back its RPS. Accordingly, the proposed line will not help these states meet their RPS standards. "

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","The fifth stated need is to “reduce the losses in transferring power and increase the efficiency of the transmission system.” DEIS at 11. The DEIS states that “[t]here is a need to reduce capacity and energy losses” for Dairyland and ATC customers. However, the DEIS provides no support or explanation for this assertion. Line losses are an unavoidable reality in the electricity grid, and there is no justification given for why current line losses in Wisconsin are unacceptably high. Further, the DEIS is unable to affirmatively state that the proposed transmission line will decrease energy losses. Rather, the DEIS states that new transmission lines “often” decrease capacity and energy losses and states that MISO’s MVP Portfolio as a whole will “reduce overall system losses.” DEIS at 16. Neither of these statements shows that this specific proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line, on its own, will actually decrease energy losses. Furthermore, the DEIS ignores the fact that the farther electrons travel over a transmission line, the greater the line losses. The best way to reduce line losses is by implementing distributed generation, where the power is used closer to where it is generated. "
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","The final purpose is to “support the changing generation mix” and improve access to renewables. DEIS at 11. Although the DEIS claims that there are 13 wind farms for which the interconnection agreements are conditional on the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line being built, eleven of those wind power projects are already in service, and the final two are under construction, despite the fact that even if it is built, the Cardinal-Hickory Creek line would not be in service until 2023. DEIS at 13. While there may be “conditions” on the interconnection agreements for these wind power projects, the DEIS fails to explain the actual significance or degree of these conditions—do the conditions result in curtailment for something like a few hours per year, or are they actually significant? Moreover, the DEIS does not discuss alternatives that could be available to the wind project owners to seek other transmission interconnections if the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line is not built. Further, the DEIS fails to acknowledge that new local distributed generation would more effectively improve access to renewables than a massive new transmission line that would also carry electricity from coal and natural-gas power plants and nuclear power plants. Of course, the DEIS must not only accurately define the purpose and need of the proposed government action, but also evaluate whether the need is real. If there is no need for the project, then the land and easements that the developers will acquire by eminent domain are not for a “public use” as the federal and Wisconsin constitutions require when private property is taken. If there is not a legitimate public purpose, this proposed high-voltage transmission line cannot be allowed to move forward. Hawaii Hous. Auth. v.

ATC is seeking to charge consumers for a highly-profitable 10.82% annual rate of return on equity, while ITC seeks a 11.32% annual rate of return, whether the line is needed “to keep the lights on” or not. The DEIS’s narrow focus and unsupported assumptions preclude reasonable alternative transmission solutions and other options that could meet the broader underlying needs just as well, such as sensible combinations of building more local renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implementing more energy efficiency to reduce energy costs.

"ALT01","General Alternatives/Range of Alternatives","ALT","Alternatives","Critically, this analysis does not disclose the degree to which each of these alternatives falls short, or whether the alternatives could, in concert, provide the same degree of benefits as the proposed transmission line. Federal regulations require that each alternative carried forward for analysis be discussed in enough detail “so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits,” 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(b), and by rejecting alternative transmission solutions so quickly, the DEIS prevents the public from being able to effectively compare alternative transmission solutions to the transmission line. Importantly, these alternative transmission solutions must be examined in various packages, and also be considered in combination with local system upgrades. The reasons why these alternatives were improperly rejected underscore the inappropriate narrowness of the purpose and need statement and improper cursory dismissal of alternative transmission solutions without acknowledging the various benefits that these alternatives can provide. Indeed, the DEIS’s entire discussion of all alternatives other than building a new high-voltage transmission line is limited to approximately three pages of text. The DEIS states that “regional and local renewable electricity generation” was rejected because it would not meet the stated purpose and need to (1) expand the access of the transmission system, (2) reduce transmission losses, or (3) respond to public policy objectives aimed at enhancing the nation’s transmission system. DEIS at 57. Yet this analysis is both superficial and flawed. First, the analysis fails completely to examine any generation types besides solar, such as wind generation, despite the fact that the DEIS in other sections acknowledges numerous large new wind facilities in the region. Additionally, the discussion of solar generation is clearly not a full and fair analysis. The DEIS complains that “siting and construction of new photovoltaic solar facilities would take time.” DEIS at 57. Any alternative would take some amount of time, and the proposed transmission line would not be in service until 2023. While new solar development would not expand the transmission system, it would reduce any need for an expanded transmission system in the first place. Contrary to the DEIS’s claim, strategically-sited distributed solar would reduce transmission losses by providing generation closer to demand, and thereby reducing the distance that the electricity would have to travel over the grid. "
"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","Furthermore, the DEIS ignores the fact that the fundamental purpose behind the “public policy objectives aimed at enhancing the nation’s transmission system” is the greater integration of renewables into the electric grid. This is more directly achieved through distributed solar generation than it would be by building a new open-access transmission line, which would carry whatever electrons are on the grid, regardless of the generation type. Moreover, the cost of photovoltaic power has fallen rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to fall during the decades that would make up the lifetime of the CHC transmission line. Lazard’s latest annual Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis (LCOE 12.0) shows that utility solar is between $36 and $44 per MWh, and utility-scale wind is as low as $29 per MWh. The analysis of the rest of the alternative transmission solutions is equally flawed and dismissive. The DEIS states that battery storage is too expensive and relies on a Dairyland report from 2016, rather than providing current cost information, which is critical to an informed analysis considering the rapid technology advances and cost decreases for batteries. Lazard’s Levilized Cost of Storage Analysis (LCOS 4.0) shows utility-scale battery storage (solar + storage) as low as $108 per MWh. Contrary to the DEIS’s conclusion, batteries most certainly do provide reliability and congestion services due to their ability to both take power off the grid during high generation / low demand, and put power back onto the grid during low generation / high demand. Battery storage also does respond to public policy objectives by making the transmission system more efficient and allowing for increased integration of renewables."
"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","The analysis of energy efficiency is deeply flawed because of its failure to consider efficiency in combination with other solutions, and because of the flawed argument that an energy efficiency alternative “would have to eliminate demand to a level that all the Renewable Portfolio Standards and Goals would be met with existing renewable resources.” DEIS at 58. This is a bizarre “red-herring” sort of argument and flawed analysis. As explained above, Wisconsin is already in compliance with its RPS, and for various reasons, much of the wind energy created in Iowa cannot even be used for compliance with RPSs in other states. Moreover, there is more than 500 megawatts of new solar energy development now in process in Wisconsin and more than 4,000 megawatts of new proposed solar energy development projects reported to be in the MISO transmission queue. Invenergy’s new 300-megawatt “Badger Hollow Solar Farm” project is located in Montfort, Wisconsin near the substation, and Invenergy has stated that: “The proposed CHC project by ATC was not a material reason for our choice to site the Badger Hollow Solar Farm project at its location in Iowa County. Invenergy planned the Badger Hollow Solar Farm project with the intention of using the existing 138kv infrastructure only…..We did not select a site in Iowa County because of CHC, nor will we abandon Iowa County if CHC is not built.” The dismissal of demand response measures is equally inappropriate. The DEIS apparently states that it cannot consider demand response measures because “there is no regulatory authority to ensure energy user compliance with load reduction and energy efficiency goals and, thus, no mechanism has been identified that would ensure adequate participation over time.” DEIS at 59. Participation in demand response programs can be modeled and predicted based on design components, financial incentives, etc. and therefore must be fully considered as an alternative. State legislatures and utility regulators throughout the country have required utilities to develop and implement demand response and efficiency programs, to ensure that those programs meet specific numeric targets, and there is a substantial body of expert analysis that models and predicts participation rates and energy savings from these programs, based on their design components, communication effectiveness, and financial incentives. The purpose and need statement relies an antiquated view of the electricity system that is rapidly becoming outdated. Distributed solar and wind energy generation, energy storage, smaller “grid edge” investments, demand response, and energy efficiency are proving to be more financially feasible, sophisticated, scalable, cleaner, and effective. A good example is Bonneville Power Administration’s 2017 decision to cancel a proposed $1 billion 80-mile 500 kV transmission line in favor of a package of efficiency, demand response, rooftop solar, and storage, with total project expenses so far staying within a $5 million per year budget. E4theFuture, Smart Peak Load Management Alliance, & Smart Electric Power Alliance, Non-Wires Alternatives: Case Studies from Leading U.S. Projects (Nov. 2018), available at https://sepapower.org/resource/non-wires-alternatives-case-studies-from-leading-u-s-projects/. In 2011, in language that mirrors the language in this DEIS, BPA and its consultants dismissed these alternatives as insufficient, based in part on load growth forecasts that did not materialize and then-current assessments of costs and feasibility. In subsequent years, however, BPA recognized that the world had changed, and that their giant transmission line project was not only not the most cost-effective solution, but indeed posed a risk of future stranded costs for ratepayers that its package of alternative transmission strategies did not. This DEIS ties itself to old assumptions and old models, and does not give these alternatives the analysis they deserve. That may benefit the bottom line of the applicants who stand to get a high guaranteed rate of return on a very expensive project, but it does not give the government agencies or the public the information they need to compare reasonable alternatives. "
"ALT01","General Alternatives/Range of Alternatives","ALT","Alternatives","Finally, it should be noted that RUS’s consideration of the costs of the proposed line and alternative transmission solutions must be on an “apples-to-apples” basis. The proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line, which was included in MISO’s MVP portfolio would be cost-shared across MISO’s footprint. MISO’s FERC-approved MVP tariff allows for cost-sharing projects that meet specific criteria. Alternative transmission solutions can meet these criteria and accordingly be cost-shared, as recognized by FERC in Orders 8904 and 1000.5 This factor must be included in RUS’s comparison of the costs and benefits of the proposed transmission line to alternative transmission solutions. 4 Order 890, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, at ¶ 479 (Feb. 16, 2007), https://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2007/021507/E-1.pdf?csrt=4501289794127783429 (“We therefore find that, where demand resources are capable of providing the functions assessed in a transmission planning process, and can be relied upon on a long-term basis, they should be permitted to participate in that process on a comparable basis.”). 5 Order 1000, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, at ¶ 148 (July 21, 2011), https://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2011/072111/E-6.pdf?csrt=17842257593214718131 (“When evaluating the merits of such alternative transmission solutions, public utility transmission providers in the transmission planning region also must consider proposed non-transmission alternatives on a comparable basis.”)."
"ALT01","General Alternatives/Range of Alternatives","ALT","Alternatives"," B. The DEIS Does Not Adequately Consider Alternative Routes that Avoid the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge and the Driftless Area The DEIS does not evaluate route alternatives that avoid crossing through the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge or even mention any routing options other than those with the start and end points of the proposed line. RUS must analyze route alternatives to bring power from the west to the east that do not cut a wide swath through the scenic and natural resource-rich Driftless Area and that do not cut through the Upper Mississippi Wildlife and Fish Refuge. According to minutes from a 2012 meeting between the developers and agency representatives, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Refuge Manager explained that “the existing transmission lines [through the Refuge] were authorized many years ago and would likely not be permitted or considered a compatible use today.” The Deputy Refuge Manager also “said he is very uncomfortable with moving forward with only Cassville options being considered, since all of these alternatives have impacts to the refuge.” Exhibit A. U.S. EPA apparently also raised significant concerns in its scoping comments about only examining routes through the Refuge, although these scoping comments are interestingly not included in the PDF of federal, state, and tribal scoping comments at https://www.rd.usda.gov/publications/environmental-studies/impact-statements/cardinal- %E2%80%93-hickory-creek-transmission-line. According to a letter from the developers to RUS in response to EPA’s comments, EPA stated: EPA recommends the Draft EIS present and evaluate one or more alternative(s) located outside Refuge lands. The selection of only two Refuge alternatives carried forward for further evaluation leaves USDA and the Applicant vulnerable to permit denial by USFWS and an ultimate decision of no action by USDA. EPA believes one or more non-Refuge alternatives is needed in order to compare and contrast impacts that would occur within and outside of the Refuge. Exhibit B. Most aspects of the asserted proposed need for the line could be met by a transmission line that does not even go through Wisconsin. While such a line would not “increase the transfer capability of the electrical system between Iowa and Wisconsin,” that element of the purpose and need statement is impermissibly narrow; because electricity demand in Wisconsin is flat or declining, there is no real need to move western electricity into Wisconsin, but only a suggested need to move electricity to eastern states. Other currently-proposed transmission lines can potentially meet that asserted need that the CHC line attempts to meet: the Grain Belt line that would connect wind power in Western Kansas to markets in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, and which was approved by Missouri regulators in March 2019; and the SOO Green Renewable Rail (SOO Green) project, an underground transmission line that would follow railroad rights of way from Mason City, Iowa, to just outside Chicago. Even if these specific proposed lines are not built, they demonstrate that there are alternative corridors and routes for moving power from west to east that would avoid significant adverse environmental impacts on the special scenic Driftless Area landscape and unique natural resources."
"ALT01","General Alternatives/Range of Alternatives","ALT","Alternatives","C. The DEIS Does Not Adequately Consider Low-Voltage Line Improvements. The DEIS’s analysis of low-voltage lines, and alternate routes is insufficient. The DEIS seems to reject low-voltage alternatives primarily, if not solely, on the basis of a determination by MISO almost a decade ago. DEIS at 59. As explained below, predetermination with respect to alternatives is impermissible, and RUS is required by law to independently analyze alternatives. The DEIS also alleges that lower-voltage transmission lines would not “respond[] to public policy objectives aimed at enhancing the nation’s transmission system.” DEIS at 59. To the contrary, new or rebuilt lower-voltage transmission lines could improve the transmission system here. The alternative of upgrading existing facilities should be evaluated in virtually any infrastructure project EIS, and certainly for any EIS on a large energy facility like a generation plant or a high-voltage transmission line. It is RUS’s responsibility to develop upgrade alternatives, and give them full consideration. "

First, the DEIS does not fully and fairly lay out both the costs and benefits of constructing the proposed transmission line underground. The DEIS states that “[p]ost-construction issues such as aesthetics, electric and magnetic fields, and property values are usually less of an issue for underground lines,” DEIS at 60, but does not discuss reduced impacts on birds from collisions, electrocutions, and increased perches; reduced fire risk; reduced operation noise; or reduced impacts on tourism and recreational values. Further, RUS relies on the applicants’ estimates of cost for undergrounding the line, rather than independently analyzing the cost. DEIS at 62. Underground transmission lines are not categorically uneconomical: The planned underground SOO Green transmission line from Mason City, Iowa to Chicago, following existing railroads, is expected to cost $2.5 billion and is backed by investors.6"

States with surplus wind generation are nonetheless supporting and subsidizing the continued operation of otherwise uneconomic fossil fuel and nuclear power generating plants through various rate mechanisms, rather than better matching supply to demand, reducing transmission congestion, and eliminating the need to keep sending power farther and farther away with more and more transmission lines. For example, in Iowa, MidAmerican Energy continues to buy and build additional wind energy capacity while it continues to keep running several coal plants that are in its rate base and then attempt to export the surplus power to the east, and Alliant Energy (Interstate Power & Light) is building natural gas plants as well as wind projects while it avoids retiring coal plants. In North Dakota, more wind energy is being developed while rate-based lignite coal plants keep running.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process"," IV. PREDETERMINATION OF THE ISSUE RUS’s improperly narrow purpose and need statement and its cursory exploration of alternative transmission solutions show that it predetermined the outcome of the NEPA analysis: a large transmission line and tall towers would be built between the Cardinal and Hickory Creek substations, and all that remained for the EIS to determine was the precise route. This approach violates NEPA because “Environmental Impact Statements shall serve as the means of assessing the environmental impact of proposed agency actions, rather than justifying decisions already made.” 40 C.F.R. 1502.2(g) RUS seems to take the construction of a transmission line as foreordained merely because the line was approved as part of the MISO MVP portfolio nearly a decade ago. This is inappropriate for several reasons. First, the MISO MVP plan did not trigger a NEPA analysis, so a full analysis must happen at this point in time. The decisions that RUS and the other federal agencies must make now—whether to provide a loan and other permits—are completely separate from and based on different factors than MISO’s considerations when it created its MVP portfolio. It is also impermissible for RUS to rely on MISO’s analysis with respect to the need for the line. The MVP analysis took place in the late 2000s, and involved a set of assumptions about future energy usage and needs that does not match the current reality. For example, Madison Gas and Electric (MGE), saw its highest retail electricity sales in 2007 (pre-economic recession) and in 2011 (post-economic recession). From 2007 to 2017, MGE retail electricity sales fell by roughly 3.2%. Total electricity sales decreased by roughly 2.27% over the same period, notwithstanding a growing economy and an 11.03% increase in the number of customers. A Rocky Mountain Institute study found that “for at least the last decade, planners have, on average, over-forecast electricity demand by one percentage point for each year of their forecast,” and that one reason for the tendency to over-forecast is that utilities have an incentive to build electricity infrastructure projects for which they can recover costs and earn a preapproved return on their investment, even if that infrastructure is “rarely needed or used.”7 Alliant-WP&L’s second-highest retail electricity sales were in 2007 (pre-economic recession) and declined steadily for nearly a decade before reaching a slightly higher level in 2016 and then declining again in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total electricity sales decreased notwithstanding economic growth and a 4.03% increase in the number of customers. A determination by MISO that the entire portfolio of projects was predicted, nearly a decade ago, to be “necessary” for the purposes of MISO planning is not the same as a specific determination, for the purposes of NEPA, that a current need can only be met by the last MVP project to be built—namely, the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line. The DEIS states that “many wind developments in Iowa and Minnesota list the C-HC Project as a conditional project,” DEIS at 59, and that “MISO has informed at least 12 wind generators in Iowa and Minnesota that they are only eligible for conditional generation interconnect agreements until the C-HC Project is built and operational.” DEIS at 13. It also notes that the “Quilt Block Wind Farm” in Lafayette County, Wisconsin” is conditional on the C-HC Project,” DEIS at 14. Because they have conditional generation interconnect agreements, these generators “have limitations with how much power can be delivered and under what 7 Mark Dyson & Alex Engel, The Billion-Dollar Costs of Forecasting Electricity Demand, ROCKY MOUNTAIN INST., Oct. 23, 2017, https://rmi.org/billion-dollar-costs-forecasting-electricity-demand/. conditions within the current regional system.” DEIS at 13. The fact that these generators have limitations—the nature and extent of which are not discussed in detail—does not mean that they need the CHC project in particular, however. When determining whether this transmission line or another solution would best meet the identified purpose and need, it is appropriate to consider that the CHC transmission line may facilitate other projects, but those projects’ existence should not be used as an excuse for RUS to assume the project must be built instead of evaluating non-transmission alternatives to solve the identified problem. If it is predicted congestion on existing transmission that is limiting production from certain wind producers, then anything that can relieve that congestion—including alternative transmission strategies—should be evaluated. Moreover, other new transmission lines—such as the SOO Green Renewable Rail (SOO Green) transmission line—can provide alternatives. The DEIS does not quantify the alleged problem, and then it simply assumes that this specific proposed new Cardinal-Hickory Creek high-voltage transmission is the only way to address the alleged problem."
"DECI01","General Decision Process","DECI","Decision Process"," V. FAILURE TO CONSIDER ISSUES INDEPENDENTLY RUS has abdicated its responsibility to independently evaluate the potential alternatives to and environmental consequences of the proposed transmission line, and instead has improperly deferred to the preferences of the applicant. RUS regulations make clear that RUS “is responsible for all environmental decisions and findings related to its actions” and must “independently evaluate” all environmental information submitted by applicants. 7 C.F.R. § 1970.5(a). Likewise, CEQ regulations applicable to all NEPA analyses state that “[t]he agency shall independently evaluate the information submitted and shall be responsible for its accuracy.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a). The NEPA process is required to be objective. Sierra Club v. Froehlke, 486 F.2d 946, 950 (7th Cir. 1973). For example, when an EIS is prepared by an independent contractor, instead of a federal agency, the contractor must be chosen by the lead and/or cooperating agencies “to avoid any conflict of interest,” the contractor must “execute a disclosure statement … specifying they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project,” and the responsible Federal official “shall independently evaluate the statement prior to its approval and take responsibility for its scope and contents.” 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(c). See also 7 C.F.R. § 1970.152. RUS’s review of data submitted by an interested party—the applicant itself—should be even more searching than its review of statements authored by unbiased contractors. RUS therefore has a duty to verify all data and assumptions contained in information submitted by the applicants, and to determine for itself which alternatives to carry forward for further analysis, rather than merely repeating the applicants’ views. The “Development of Alternatives” section, beginning on page 31 of the DEIS, demonstrates the extent to which RUS has chosen to defer to the applicants’ analysis. This section describes documents created by the applicants or their contractors—the Alternatives Evaluation Study (AES), the Alternative Crossings Analysis, and the Macro-Corridor Study—but does not provide any additional analysis of the information contained in those documents or suggest any additional action alternatives. The Macro-Corridor Study and Alternatives Evaluation Study are required by RUS guidance,8 and the Alternative Crossings Analysis was prepared “at the request of the Refuge manager who has emphasized that, before determining whether the proposed use would be compatible and consistent with the USFWS Mitigation Policy, no transmission line crossing of the Refuge could be considered by the USFWS unless Utilities could demonstrate that non-Refuge options were infeasible.” ACA at ES-7. Instead of analyzing the information provided by applicants, the DEIS merely parrots the conclusions of 8 RUS, 2016, RD Instruction 1970-O, Exhibit B: Guidance for Preparing an Alternative Evaluation Study, Exhibit D: Guidance for Creating a Macro-Corridor Study, https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/1970o.pdf. those documents. For example, the discussion of alternative transmission corridors begins, “[t]his section describes the alternative transmission line corridors that were identified and investigated by the Utilities….” DEIS at 34 (emphasis added). The DEIS dismisses river crossing alternatives because “the Utilities determined” that they were not feasible. DEIS at 51. The discussion of energy storage as an alternative action cites only to Dairyland’s AES and contains language substantially similar to that in the AES. DEIS at 57–58; AES at 46–47. Similarly, the DEIS cites to Dairyland’s AES to support the statement that “[a]n increase in energy efficiency substantial enough to offset the need for the proposed C-HC Project would not be possible.” DEIS at 58.While RUS regulations require applicants to provide necessary environmental information, identify a project’s purpose and need, identify alternatives, and “assist the Agency in all aspects of preparing an EIS …, including, but not limited to, information and data collection and public involvement activities,” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.5, NEPA “do[es] not permit the responsible federal agency to abdicate its statutory duties by reflexively rubber stamping a statement prepared by others.” Sierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43, 59 (5th Cir. 1974)."
"EFF01","General Effects Analysis","EFF","Effects Analysis","VI. INADEQUATE ANALYSIS OF IMPACTS Flaws in the analysis of the alternative routes’ impacts include: incomplete information and analysis; failure to fully consider the full range and scope of impacts, including impacts outside of the ROW; understating impacts or failure to fully disclose adverse effects; and overstating or assuming success of avoidance, remediation, and restoration efforts. One of the requirements of NEPA review is that “[t]he information [in NEPA documents] must be of high quality. Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b). The information in this DEIS is not thorough enough to “provide a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and to inform the appropriate Agency decision maker and the public of … any measures that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.151. RUS should respond to these comments by “supplementing or modifying the analysis” contained in the EIS so that it is sufficient for RUS to fulfill its obligations under NEPA. 7 C.F.R. § 1970.154. A. Scope of the Actions Included in the Impacts Analysis As an initial matter, the scope of the impacts analysis appears to be improperly narrow and fails to consider impacts from all aspects of the project and related and connected actions. In the description of the proposed project, the DEIS states: In a number of locations, there are existing lower-voltage electric lines along the proposed C-HC Project transmission line routes that would be relocated and double circuited with the new C-HC Project 234-kv line, using a portion of the existing ROW. In other cases, the Utilities propose to relocate the existing line elsewhere. In a few locations . . . the Utilities proposed to double circuit the existing and new C-HC Project 345-kV transmission lines on a new ROW. DEIS at 97. The DEIS also explains, “It is important to note that local distribution companies often relocate their distribution facilities ahead of transmission line construction.” DEIS at 98. Then in the section on connected actions, the DEIS also explains that once the CHC line is operational, Dairyland would retire and remove almost 3 miles of an existing transmission line from the Stoneman substation in Cassville, Wisconsin to the Turkey River Substation in Clayton County, Iowa. DEIS at 110. The impacts from taking down existing transmission and distribution lines, and then re-siting some of these in new corridors, may be substantial. Yet the DEIS does not seem to address the impacts from these actions, anywhere in the DEIS."
"SOIL02","Disturbance, Erosion, etc.","SOIL","Soils"," B. Geology and Soils The analysis of geology and soil impacts from the proposed transmission line is inadequate. In particular, this section characterizes many impacts as temporary by over-relying on mitigation measures, fails to disclose the precise nature and extent of many impacts, and examines an improperly narrow geographic scope. The DEIS improperly assumes that the only permanent impacts would be to the soil directly within the footprints of the individual towers, and that impacts to all other areas can be mitigated or restored. For example, the DEIS states that “[a]ssuming that all impacts would be repaired immediately following construction, temporary impacts to sensitive soils are generally expected to be moderate and short term for each alternative. The greatest potential temporary impact to soils and geology from the C-HC Project is severe erosion.” DEIS at 141. However, it provides no data to support the assumption that impacts can be “repaired” at all, let alone “immediately.” "
"SOIL02","Disturbance, Erosion, etc.","SOIL","Soils","The analysis of cumulative soil impacts relies heavily on mitigation measures and best management practices, but does not describe the nature or quantify the extent of these “minimized” impacts, nor does it provide evidence that mitigation measures will be successful. DEIS at 419, 435. As explained in comments by Barbara Peckarsky, Emeritus Professor of Stream Ecology, Cornell University, “Silt loam soils, which are the most erodible of all soils, predominate in the analysis area.” Peckarsky Comments at 2, Exhibit C. The DEIS characterizes the majority of soil impacts, including erosion, as “temporary” and states that, other than the displacement of rocks and soil within construction footprints, “[i]t is assumed … that long-term permanent impacts would not occur due to the implementation of appropriate environmental commitments, restoration, avoidance, and erosion and sediment control measures.” DEIS at 133. For example, Alternative 1 involves the “potential for severe erosion … along 67% of the ROW,” and would cause “adverse impacts to sensitive soils” that “would be moderate and long-term if not immediately repaired.” DEIS at 136. If immediate repair occurs, “adverse impacts would be moderate, short-term, and generally limited to the impact area.” Id. "
"SOIL02","Disturbance, Erosion, etc.","SOIL","Soils","There is no explanation of why erosion should be considered a temporary impact. While further erosion could perhaps be expected to cease once construction activity has ended and vegetation has been restored, the soil would continue to exist in an eroded state, compared to the pre-construction baseline, and downstream areas suffering from excessive sedimentation would continue to suffer. Where soil compaction occurs, the best management practices appendix to the DEIS states that “either the landowner would be compensated for lost productivity or appropriate equipment should be used to restore the soil tilth.” DEIS at D-3. This discussion of soil impacts ignores the potential that soil compaction could be a long term or permanent impact in wetlands or other locations in which the primary concern about soil compaction would be the effect on ecosystems, rather than lost crop productivity and ignores the fact that soil that has been compacted and then mechanically re-aerated may still suffer from ongoing issues compared to the pre-construction baseline. The alternative-specific analysis is improper because it is limited to impacts within 300 feet of the center of the right-of-way and land directly within the footprint of access roads. Yet the DEIS states earlier in the section that “potential for soil erosion increases not only in the affected area, but erosion could increase in area as rills and gullies are formed and stormwater runoff is channelized across broad areas of land.” DEIS at 135. RUS’s analysis does not fully disclose the scope and severity of impacts. "
"VEG04","Wetlands/Riparian Areas","VEG","Vegetation","C. Vegetation and Wetlands The DEIS’s discussion of wetlands relies on generalities and indicates a limited recognition of the importance of wetlands and how they function. RUS has not obtained or provided the necessary information on the specific wetlands that would be impacted, does not provide adequate or meaningful quantification of impacts, and relies on BMPs and mitigation without any evidence of their efficacy. First, the DEIS is insufficient because it does not provide the required information about the resources that will be impacted by the proposed massive transmission line. RUS repeatedly states that it has not carried out the surveys necessary to know exactly what plant communities exist in the corridor and would be impacted. See, e.g., DEIS at 149 (“Targeted plant inventories have not been completed for the project.”); DEIS at 151 (“Comprehensive vegetation community surveys and mapping has not been completed for the project.”). Without this information, RUS necessarily cannot analyze and disclose impacts. As retired WDNR Wetland Ecologist Pat Trochlell noted in her comments, wetland delineations cannot be accurately determined without an on-the-ground survey, and RUS’s delineation attempt—which relies on remote data—“is likely to have missed significant areas of wetland.” Trochlell Comments at 1-2, Exhibit D. In addition, the information on wetland plant communities seems to show a lack of understanding of different wetland plant communities. See, e.g., Trochlell Comments at 1, Exhibit D (identifying a lack of understanding of how wetlands are categorized, or what those categories mean). At several points, the DEIS refers to wetlands as a single type of plant community, despite the fact that WDNR’s Bureau of Natural Heritage Conservation recognizes thirty-five natural wetland plant communities. See DEIS at 143 (noting existence of 14 natural communities), 152 Table 3.3-2 (seemingly characterizing wetlands as a single vegetation community, and mischaracterizing “floodplain forest” as a forest rather than a wetland); Trochlell Comments at 1, Exhibit D. At other points, the DEIS recognizes the existence of fourteen natural plant communities, but bases that assumption on element occurrence data from WDNR that is incomplete. Trochlell Comments at 1, Exhibit D."
"VEG04","Wetlands/Riparian Areas","VEG","Vegetation","In addition, the DEIS is unclear regarding the geographical scope of wetlands impacts. The DEIS looks at the “resource evaluation area,” which “reflect[s] the geographic extent of all data used to characterize vegetation.” DEIS at 143. While it is appropriate to look at impacts beyond the right of way, providing information on the acreage of the various wetland types within the resource evaluation area is meaningless when there is no map or other information given about what the resource evaluation area encompasses, or what amount of the resource evaluation area will potentially be impacted. See DEIS at 148. As discussed by both wetland ecologists Professor Joy Zedler and Pat Trochlell, the DEIS also classifies much of the impacted wetlands as “degraded” without an adequate explanation of this determination. Zedler Comments at 3, Exhibit E; Trochlell Comments at 1, Exhibit D. The DEIS mentions the existence of “higher quality wetlands,” including wet prairie, shrub carr, and hardwood swamp communities, DEIS at 148, but it does not describe these communities, either in the preceding section describing wetlands or anywhere else. Trochlell Comments at 1, Exhibit D. The DEIS claims on page 152 that a 300-foot wide analysis area along the proposed route “is sufficient to identify vegetation resources that could be directly and indirectly affected by the C-HC Project.” Yet many impacts to vegetation and plant communities could easily reach beyond a 300 foot wide corridor (only 150 feet in each direction from the centerline). For example, ground disturbance from construction equipment, which may occur much closer than 150 feet to the edge of the 300 foot analysis area, could easily cause erosion that leads to increased sedimentation in nearby wetlands not within the analysis area. Comments of Pat Trochlell at 2, Exhibit D (stating that “[i]mpacts to wetlands along stream corridors may affect wetlands downstream”). “Removal of vegetation may have far-reaching adverse impacts on large areas of wetland outside the direct impact areas. These impacts include loss of native species diversity, increased erosion and sedimentation, habitat loss and loss of natural scenic beauty.” Comments of Pat Trochlell at 2, Exhibit D. Similarly, if invasive species are introduced, they could quickly and easily spread far beyond this analysis area. As Professor Joy Zedler states in her comments, “disturbance typically leads to permanent dominance by invasive plants. Once the invaders are present, they spread vegetatively beyond the introduction sites.” Zedler Comments at 5, Exhibit E. Furthermore, it is unclear what—if any—buffer area is considered for impacts along access roads and laydown yards."
"VEG04","Wetlands/Riparian Areas","VEG","Vegetation","The DEIS fails to meaningfully quantify—or even fully discuss—impacts, instead relying entirely on simply listing number of acres that could be impacted. It is impossible to glean from the information provided the actual extent and degree of the direct impacts, and no attempt is made to quantify indirect impacts, such as sediment deposition and alteration of hydrology. As explained by Professor Joy Zedler: Massive concrete bases displace native plants and animals—and reduce the wetland’s ability to soak up flood waters, purify runoff, and store carbon in the soil. It doesn’t take much of a change in water flow and water depth (i.e., the wetland hydroperiod) to shift a species-rich wetland to a weedy patch of alien cattails. Such shifts are aided by soil disturbance during construction. Even a 6-inch pile of dirt invites weedy shrubs and trees to invade a wet meadow or marsh. Zedler Comments at 2, Exhibit E. "
"VEG04","Wetlands/Riparian Areas","VEG","Vegetation","The DEIS also fails to acknowledge the importance and significant benefits of wetlands generally, or discuss the ecological services provided by the specific wetlands that would be impacted here. Wetlands ecologist Professor Joy Zedler explains that the DEIS does not provide data on the specific ecosystem services provided by the wetlands that would be impacted, despite the fact that this information is available. Zedler Comments at 3-4, Exhibit E (The Nature Conservancy and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources have the ability to quantify predicted services for wetlands throughout the State of Wisconsin. See http://www.wetlandsbydesign.org/, which provides a free interactive tool called Explorer. ). The DEIS should identify the relevant ecological services provided and quantify the monetary value of the services that might be lost. For reference, a 2014 article estimated that the monetary value of ecosystem services from inland wetlands is $25,681/ha/yr or $10,397/acre/yr in 2007 dollars. Robert Constanza, et al., Changes in the Global Value of Ecosystem Service, Global Environmental Change (May 2014). This is equivalent to $12,929.07/acre/yr in 2019 dollars. The DEIS shows that, depending on the route, up to 183 acres of wetlands may be directly and indirectly impacted. DEIS at 167, Table 3.3-17. Over 40 years, the proposed line could disrupt ecological services with a value of almost $95 million. Finally, the DEIS improperly discounts most wetland impacts by assuming—without support—that BMPs and restoration measures will all be fully successful, and that impacts will necessarily be temporary. See DEIS at 155 (seemingly asserting that the only permanent wetlands impacts will be the actual placement of structures within wetlands). "

"EFF04","Mitigation/Environmental Commitments","EFF","Effects Analysis","In many circumstances, it is not clear whether various commitments are binding. In the section on special status plant species, the DEIS states that the developers would “avoid” certain damaging actions—for example, “[b]roadcast herbicide application would be avoided in areas where suitable habitat and/or where individual plants/populations are present.” DEIS at 156 (emphasis added). If this is a firm commitment, it should be stated that broadcast herbicide application will not be used in these areas. It is important to discuss planned mitigation measures in detail, not only to facilitate informed decisionmaking, but because “[m]itigation measures described in the environmental review and decision documents must be included as conditions in Agency financial commitment documents.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.5. These mitigation measures must be incorporated in the plans and construction contracts for the project, and must be maintained “for the life of the loans.” Id. D. The DEIS’s Analysis of Wildlife Impacts Is Deeply Flawed and Legally Inadequate. "
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","The DEIS’s discussion of wildlife impacts is also significantly flawed and legally inadequate. First, species surveys have not been completed, and information on impacted species is therefore inadequate. Second, the DEIS misses, discounts, or mischaracterizes several adverse impacts. Third, the reliance on BMPs and restoration measures is unsupported. The RUS apparently did not conduct a species survey to inform the DEIS. RUS necessarily cannot reveal what species will be impacted, and what those impacts will be, if it does not even know this information itself. The wildlife discussion also misses, dismisses, or mischaracterizes numerous species impacts. The analysis of bird impacts is especially inadequate. The DEIS states that “[o]peration of the proposed project would present the potential for avian collisions with the transmission line” and that “[e]lectrocutions of large avian species, particularly raptors, have been known to occur from contact with energized lines.” DEIS at 185. Bird collisions and electrocutions are well-known and widely-documented impacts from transmission line, and are guaranteed to occur if the Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line is built. Millions of birds die each year in the United States due to collisions with or electrocution by power lines.9 Based on multiple studies in the northern United States and Canada, waterfowl are the bird group most vulnerable to death by transmission lines.10 This presents a significant danger to the thousands of waterfowl congregating on the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge each year. The DEIS downplays bird collisions and electrocutions as a minor and unlikely risk, while this 9 Scott R. Loss et al., Refining Estimates of Bird Collision and Electrocution Mortality at Power Lines in the United States, PLoS ONE, 9(7): e101565 (2014) http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101565. 10 Sebastien Rioux, Avian Mortalities Due to Transmission Line Collisions, Avian Conservation and Ecology 8(2): 7 (2013) http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-00614-080207. impact is actually quite significant. The DEIS points to bird safety guidelines, yet provides no evidence on the efficacy of these measures, let alone any data to support the assertion that the risk of electrocution would be “minor.” DEIS at 185."
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","Additionally, while the DEIS notes that “[t]he presence of transmission structures would provide perches . . . for some species,” DEIS at 185, it fails to acknowledge that this may negatively impact rare and declining grassland bird species by providing perches for hawks and other predator species. The DEIS also downplays impacts to specific bird species. The DEIS states that “it was determined that there are no records of whooping cranes using land within the analysis area or near the Refuge.” DEIS at 177. The DEIS’s assertion that “the project would have no effect to whooping cranes” is completely unsupportable. DEIS at 187. Regardless of whether anyone happens to have recorded whooping cranes within the very narrow specific corridors proposed for the transmission line, it is undeniable that the overall area in which the transmission line would be constructed is very important for whooping cranes. Whooping cranes almost certainly migrate across the proposed transmission line routes.11 In fact, in 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sent an email to ITC with “an image from this spring/summer of whooping cranes in the Turkey River Bottoms.” See Exhibit F. The Turkey River Bottoms is the area where the Turkey River meets the Mississippi River—exactly the area where the proposed transmission line would run. “[C]ollision mortality from power lines is considered biologically significant” for whooping cranes, and one study found that “in the migratory Wisconsin population, 3 out of 18 11 See, e.g., Whooping Crane: Current Summering and Wintering Areas, https://www.savingcranes.org/images/stories/site_images/species-field-guide/wc_map2012_800.jpg. mortalities (17%) were from collisions with power lines.”12 With a total world population of fewer than 1,000, any individual deaths are significant."
"WLDLF04","TES Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","The DEIS also ignores impacts to bald eagles. Although acknowledging the presence of bald eagles—including nesting bald eagles—in the area, the DEIS seems to assume that following bird safety guidelines will eliminate any significant impacts. DEIS at 185. RUS has not yet conducted eagle nest surveys, but states that coordination with government agencies would “minimize the impacts to nearby nesting eagles.” No details are provided about the safety guidelines or steps to minimizing impacts to nests, nor is evidence provided that such measures would actually be effective. Even if construction does not take place during the months when a nearby nest is active, bald eagles often return to the same nest year after year. In subsequent years, the massive high-voltage transmission line next to a nest would create a significant hazard for both adult eagles and young eaglets learning to fly. "
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","The DEIS’s explanation of habitat impacts is also flawed. The DEIS states: [P]ermanent displacement of [wildlife species] is not anticipated, except potentially in cleared forest areas that may provide habitat for forest-obligate species and in areas of permanent conversion to substations. Forest habitat would be available in other areas near or adjacent to the ROW, and any loss of woodland would be minimal, with adjacent woodland areas still available along the route for refuge during construction and as habitat during project operation. DEIS at 184. This analysis completely ignores species that require large and unbroken areas of habitat. This analysis would also find that any amount of forest habitat destruction is fine, as long as there is still some forest habitat remaining. This is inaccurate, and ignores the fact that a smaller amount of forest habitat will support fewer individuals of any given species. 12 Edison Electric Institute, Reducing Avian Collisions with Power Lines, http://www.aplic.org/uploads/files/15518/Reducing_Avian_Collisions_2012watermarkLR.pdf at 33–34 (2012).

What amount of spilled hazardous material is typical for a transmission line project? The DEIS then states, “[I]f restoration activities were successful potential erosion would be minimized. However, if restoration activities were not successful erosion could continue to impact water quality for fish species throughout the operation and maintenance of the transmission line.” DEIS at 186. The DEIS does not state how likely restoration activities are to be successful, or what level of erosion should be expected if they are now. Similarly, the section on reptiles and amphibians states: Areas of ground disturbance would be restored to the extent possible upon completion of construction activities.

However, if restoration activities are not successful, erosion could continue throughout the life of the transmission line operation and maintenance, which may contribute to long-term impacts to water quality for amphibian species. DEIS at 186. This says essentially nothing.

"WAT01","General Water Resources","WAT","Water Resources","E. Water Quality The DEIS’s discussion of water quality impacts displays many of the same flaws already identified in other sections. Some impacts are not discussed in sufficient detail to inform the decision, such as vegetation removal, dewatering, and impacts to floodplains. The conclusion that many impacts would be only minor or short term relies heavily on the success of BMPs and mitigation measures, but the DEIS does not discuss those practices and mitigation measures in sufficient detail to justify that conclusion. As an initial matter, there appear to be mistakes in the calculation of number of impacted waterways. As pointed out by Barbara Peckarsky, the DEIS states on page 200: “There are approximately 21 Outstanding Resource Waters and Exceptional Resource Waters within the Wisconsin portion of the analysis area, including 10 that are within the analysis area.” Peckarsky Comments at 2, Exhibit C.

"WAT01","General Water Resources","WAT","Water Resources"," The DEIS notes the impacts on water bodies from removing vegetation, but does not quantify the degree of impacts or describe specific impacts to aquatic habitat. Removal of trees and other tall vegetation that shade water bodies can elevate stream water temperatures, affecting trout and the insects on which trout feed. Peckarsky Comments at 3, Exhibit C (explaining long-term adverse effects of removal of shade trees). The DEIS seems to assume no impacts will remain after revegetation, but the ROW will not be revegetated with trees, and the particular plants that will be used for revegetation in the ROW and other areas are not specified. If low-growing plants replace shade trees, revegetation may help to mitigate soil and erosion impacts, but would not restore pre-construction water temperatures. Peckarsky Comments at 3, Exhibit C.

Cir. 2017) (holding that, despite any uncertainty, EIS should have at least attempted to quantify downstream greenhouse gas emissions attributable to oil pipeline); WildEarth Guardians v. United States Bureau of Land Mgmt., 870 F.3d 1222, 1235 (10th Cir. 2017) (holding that NEPA analysis of coal lease could not ignore emissions from burning coal by assuming that, in absence of lease, perfect substitution from other sources would occur); Border Power Plant Working Grp. v. Dep't of Energy, 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1017 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (“Because the EBC turbine and the BCP transmission line are two links in the same chain, the emissions resulting from the operation of the EBC turbine are ‘effects’ of the BCP transmission line that must be analyzed under NEPA.”); Mid States Coal. for Progress v.

"AIR04","Climate Change","AIR","Air Quality","A 2016 CEQ guidance document directed agencies to “quantify a proposed agency action’s projected direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account available data and GHG quantification tools that are suitable for the proposed agency action” or “explain the basis for determining that quantification is not reasonably available.”13 Multiple resources exist to help agencies quantify the full range of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions projects may create,14 and RUS should either use these tools (for example, by using an emissions calculator based on the current mix of generation in Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota) or explain why it is not able to account for the project’s full range of greenhouse gas emissions. See Citizens for a Healthy Community v. BLM, No. 1:17-cv-02519-LTB-GPG, slip op. at 17 (D. Colo., Mar. 27, 2019) (“[A]n agency cannot rely on production estimates while simultaneously claiming it would be too speculative to rely upon the predicted emissions from those same production estimates.”). The DEIS reports emissions of greenhouse gases in metric tons per year, but notably does not attempt to put a monetary value on the adverse impacts of these emissions. A tool exists to do exactly this: the social cost of carbon. This metric refers to the cost that emitting one ton of carbon dioxide (or a quantity of other greenhouse gases with the equivalent global warming potential) into the atmosphere has in terms of future harms to public health, infrastructure, agriculture, and other human activities. The correct value for the social cost of carbon is disputed. The federal government formerly used a value of $42 (in 2007$ per metric ton) for each ton of carbon emitted in 2020 when calculating the costs and benefits of agency 13 Final Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate Change in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews, at 4, https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/nepa_final_ghg_guidance.pdf. While this guidance document has since been withdrawn, it has not been replaced with alternative guidance, and it still represents a reasoned position on the appropriate way to consider climate change impacts during NEPA review. 14 See, e.g. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Accounting Tools, NEPA.GOV, https://ceq.doe.gov/guidance/ghg-accounting-tools.html. rulemaking.15 Recently, the government has indicated a preference for a value of $1 to $7 (in 2016$ per metric ton) in 2020.16 RUS could easily calculate the social cost of carbon according to either federal number (or according to an alternative value put forth by other groups17), or use both numbers to provide a range for the monetized benefits. WildEarth Guardians v. Zinke, No. 16-1724, slip op. at 33 (D.D.C. March 19, 2019) (agency cannot “simply throw up its hands” in the face of uncertainty, but must make an effort to provide an estimate, even if in a range of forecasts). Providing a dollar amount estimate of the social cost of the project’s greenhouse gas emissions would make this impact more easily understandable and concrete for members of the public. It is probably hard for most people to envision what a ton of carbon dioxide looks like, let alone understand the impacts caused by this volume of invisible gas. The RUS’s failure to monetize the climate change impacts by using the social cost of carbon, or some other appropriate recognized method, stands out in light of the DEIS’s monetization of many other impacts of the project. At least one federal court has held that an EIS “was arbitrary and capricious to quantify the benefits of an action while failing to quantify the costs of the action even though such an analysis was possible” through use of the social cost of carbon.

Katharine Ricke, et al., Country-level Social Cost of Carbon, NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 8, 895–900 (Sept. 24, 2018). The same study suggested that the median global social cost of carbon is $417, but that this cost is distributed unequally across countries, with the U.S. directly experiencing $48 (or approximately 11%) of the impact of every ton of carbon emitted across the globe. Id. United States Office of Surface Mining, No. CV 15-106-M-DWM, 2017 WL 5047901 (D. Mont. Nov. 3, 2017). And another federal court has stated that NEPA’s “hard look” requirement includes “a ‘hard look’ at whether this tool [the social cost of carbon], however imprecise it might be, would contribute to a more informed assessment of the impacts than if it were simply ignored.” High Country Conservation Advocates v. United States Forest Serv., 52 F. Supp. 3d 1174, 1193 (D. Colo. 2014). RUS should provide an estimate of the social cost of the project’s GHG emissions and, if it chooses not to use the social cost of carbon to create this estimate, must explain its reasons for that choice.18 WildEarth Guardians v. Zinke, No. 16-1724, slip op. at 48–50 & n.30 (D.D.C. March 19, 2019).

"CUL01","General Cultural Resources","CUL","Culural Resources"," H. Cultural and Historic Resources It is impossible to fully evaluate the impact the transmission line would have on cultural and historical resources when only a small portion of the project route has actually been inventoried for cultural resources as of yet and cultural consultation with tribes is ongoing. DEIS at 255. The RUS must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act as well as directly with NEPA. Two tribes have identified sensitive cultural resources within the area, but the RUS states that because it has not yet been notified of what or where these resources are, it cannot yet evaluate how the line might impact them. DEIS at 283. The DEIS acknowledges that the full extent of impacts is unknown because there could be remaining unknown sites which would suffer irreversible impacts. DEIS at 283. The DEIS acknowledges that “[u]nder Section 106 of the NHPA, agencies are required to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify, in coordination with other interested parties including State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs) and Native American tribal groups, whether historic properties are present within the area of potential effects (APE) of an undertaking and whether they would be significantly impacted by that undertaking.” DEIS at 252. Yet this review has apparently not yet been completed, since one of the listed “environmental commitments” states that consultation “would be required under Section 106 of the NHPA” and that it “must be completed prior to the start of construction activities.” DEIS at 126. The summary of impacts states that “impacts to those sites where adverse effects are mitigated would be minor or moderate,” DEIS at 283, but provides no support for the conclusion that steps taken to avoid or minimize impacts would actually mitigate impacts to only a “minor or moderate” level, and does not discuss specific mitigation measures in detail. The DEIS states that “[f]or resources within the Indirect APE, the impacts to affected resources would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,” DEIS at 284, but does not explain when or how this evaluation would occur. The analysis of impacts of each alternative lists several sites as “Undetermined, recommended not eligible,” but does not explain what this recommendation is based on.

"NOISE01","General Noise","NOISE","Noise","G. Noise The DEIS’s analysis of noise impacts is also flawed. First, the estimated construction noise levels are based on sound measurements from a highway project in the 1990s, stating that the model used “includes the same types of equipment that would be used in the construction of the project.” DEIS at 226. It is not clear that this is the best information available to analyze the noise impacts of the construction of the proposed transmission line—is there not more recent and relevant information available? Does this model include the use of helicopters (which will be used for the CHC line) or “drilling, blasting, [and] excavation” (DEIS at 135)? The noise modeling for substation construction is also flawed because it assumes that all construction activity operates at the very center of the construction area. DEIS at 227. Any time construction activity is not at this exact spot, it will necessarily be closer to one of the property lines and closer to neighboring residences, with louder and more disruptive impacts than modeled. In addition, measuring impacts based on distance to nearest residence likely underestimates impacts, as there may be closer land uses that may be impacted, such as hiking or bird watching. Impacts from corona noise during line operation are also likely underestimated, as the DEIS only considers the decibel level “as heard from the edge of the ROW,” DEIS at 232, when people will indisputably pass directly underneath the line within the ROW—for example, landowners whose land falls under the line, wildlife observers within the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, or hikers on the Pecatonica State trail. The DEIS states that “[g]enerally, construction-related groundborne vibration is not expected to extend beyond 25 feet from the generating source.” DEIS at 232. It is unclear whether “drilling, blasting, [and] excavation” was considered in this statement. DEIS at 135. The DEIS’s qualitative characterizations of noise impacts are also problematic. For example, it describes helicopter noise impact as “minor,” while stating that noise level at nearby residences would be “in the range of about 83 to 87 dBA,” DEIS at 231, which is characterized as “very loud” and approaching a level that can cause hearing damage. DEIS at 224. General construction noise is predicted to be at a similar level, DEIS at 231, yet is also characterized as being “minor.” DEIS at 235. It is highly unlikely that noise at this level would not “detract from current user activities,” as would be required to meet the DEIS’s own standard for a “minor impact.” DEIS at 227."
"CUL01","General Cultural Resources","CUL","Culural Resources"," Finally, the DEIS explains that impacts to the Nelson Dewey State Park and Home Site were identified as concerns during public scoping, but asserts that the proposed corridors would be no closer than 3,100 feet to the park. DEIS at 263, 280, 283. In fact, the map included in the DEIS clearly shows that the northernmost proposed corridor would be no more than 1000 feet from the edge of the Park. Further, the state DEIS states that the closest route would be approximately 400 feet from Nelson Dewey State Park. Included here is the entire map of [Figure 3.14-1 C-HC Project vicinity with the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge] proposed Mississippi River crossings from page 407, along with a close-up of the transmission lines as they pass by the Nelson Dewey State Park, with the distance scale superimposed for reference. The inclusion of this clear factual error, which was used as the basis to entirely dismiss valid concerns raised by the public about impacts to the Nelson Dewey State Park, raises concern generally about the accuracy of information throughout the DEIS.

"AIR04","Climate Change","AIR","Air Quality","F. Air Quality and Climate Change The DEIS does not contain a comprehensive greenhouse gas (“GHG”) analysis that discloses the full climate change impact of the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line and the cumulative impacts in combination with other transmission line projects. WildEarth Guardians v. Zinke, No. 16-1724, slip op. at 2, 24, 28-40, 44-46 (D.D.C. March 19, 2019). RUS must “use the NEPA process, to the maximum extent feasible, to identify and encourage opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by proposed Federal actions that would otherwise result in the emission of substantial quantities of GHG.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.4. RUS cannot meet that obligation if the EIS does not even acknowledge the full scope of emissions the project will create. First, the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line is “open access” under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules. Accordingly, all electricity generators—coal plants, natural gas plants, wind power projects, nuclear power plants and others—can bid to reserve transmission capacity on the line. That will enable some coal plants and natural gas plants, which might otherwise be retired, to keep operating and continue to produce greenhouse gas emissions that would not occur if this surplus generating capacity in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota were to shut down. Because most wind power generation occurs at night when demand is relatively low in the Midwest electric power market, fossil fuel plants that can operate with full production during all 24 hours of the day are also likely to seek to reserve capacity on the Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line. The DEIS therefore should have analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change impacts, associated with the electricity that the line would carry. WildEarth Guardians v. Zinke, No. 16-1724, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. March 19, 2019) (EIS must “provide the information necessary for the public and agency decisionmakers to understand the degree to which the [federal action] at issue would contribute to [climate change] impacts”).

Not only will the surface be scarred, but the structures will cause irreparable damage to the earth. The landscape in the Driftless area is fragile and continentally significant. It doesn't exist anywhere else! People travel from all over to visit the world renowned cheese makers and farms in the area just as they do wineries in other parts of the country. Power lines across the farms and lands will greatly reduce tourism. But a more important factor is the toll it will take on the people living along the path of the proposed lines. Their property values, according to real estate agents, will be reduced by 40%, not to mention the negative health effects of living near the high intensity power lines.

For example, routes for organized cycling events, such as the successful Horribly Hilly Hundred, which begins at Blue Mound State Park, have passed directly under some of the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line segments. The construction of a massive high-voltage transmission line will impact recreation opportunities far beyond the actual right of way. The summary of impacts also assumes that, in recreation areas in which the transmission line would “follow an existing transmission line ROW, … impacts are limited to only construction activities.” DEIS at 309. This assumption ignores the possibility that the new towers could be taller and therefore more visible and much more aesthetically disrupting than existing towers, that the cleared area of the ROW would be expanded or widened, or that two transmission lines in a single ROW could create any other impacts different from those of a single line.

"LAND01","General Land Use","LAND","Land Use","4. Development Plans The DEIS concludes that there will be no impact to comprehensive land use plans because “transmission line ROW development is not prohibited” and “[u]nder the applicable zoning ordinances and comprehensive plans, transmission lines are either a permitted or a conditional use in all jurisdictions traversed by the proposed ROW.” DEIS at 311. Just because a transmission line is not completely prohibited does not mean that its construction would be consistent with development goals of local communities or other entities, which may prioritize preserving the natural character of the area. For example, one of the proposed corridors would run adjacent to the Village of Ridgeway, which has a 2018 Comprehensive Plan that emphasizes the importance of the natural scenic beauty and small town feel of the community. One of the three guiding principles for the whole plan is to “[p]rotect and preserve the small community character of the Village of Ridgeway.”20 The first two guiding principles for the “Agricultural, Cultural & Natural Resources” section are to “propose tourism opportunities, with an emphasis on local resources/features, such as trails, walking tours, the depot & other historical areas, etc.,” and to “[n]ote the value of local agricultural, cultural, & natural resources/heritage, and recommend protecting and leveraging them for community development.”21 The section on Future Land Use states that “[p]eople will visit the area due to its scenic beauty and recreational advantages” and 20 Village of Ridgeway 2018 Comprehensive Plan at 21, https://www.villageofridgeway.com/comprehensive-plan/. Id. at 15. notes that the Military Ridge Trail (which would join up with the proposed transmission line corridor just north and south of the Village), is a primary draw for residents.22 The proposed transmission line would certainly interfere with the Village’s vision for its development, and would likely similarly interfere with the comprehensive plans and development goals of many of the other towns and villages along the proposed routes. The Dane County Board, the Iowa County Board, and numerous local municipalities have passed resolutions opposing the line or requesting the consideration of alternatives for this precise reason.23 The DEIS cannot ignore these impacts. Beyond zoning ordinances and municipality plans, RUS must also consider compatibility of the proposed transmission line with other local land use and development plans in the area, many of which call for protection of environmental, scenic, cultural, and recreational values. For example, the Southwest Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission’s Grow Southwest Wisconsin plan (2013)24 envisions: The Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin will have plentiful, clean surface and groundwater, fresh, clean air, and numerous outdoor recreational opportunities and venues. Local, healthy food options will abound as sustainable, diverse, and alternative farms will supply all sorts of markets from local niche markets to national commodity crops. Forests will be healthy and managed for multiple uses including timber, wildlife, and habitat. Wind, solar, and other regionally produced energy sources will power southwestern Wisconsin homes, businesses, and transportation systems. The native vegetation and habitats will be invasive-free, high in biodiversity, with larger and more plentiful natural communities integrated across the landscape.

"LAND02","Agriculture","LAND","Land Use","5. Agriculture The Wisconsin Farmers Union has publicly announced its opposition to the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line. The DEIS’s analysis of agricultural impacts is also insufficient. The DEIS acknowledges that construction of the CHC line may lead to some farms losing their organic certifications due to introduction of chemicals or herbicides that are prohibited in organic crops. DEIS at 293. There is no analysis of how many organic farms may be affected, nor is there any quantification of the economic impact that this loss of certification would have. Farmers invest significant resources in compliance with organic standards, relying on the price premium commanded by organic crops to compensate them for more costly growing practices. Scoping comments submitted by five agriculturally-related businesses, including organic farmers, explained that RUS “should evaluate the adverse direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts on our and other dairy farms, organic farms, and other farm-related businesses in the Driftless Area.” To minimize the impacts to organic farmers, herbicide spraying would be at least fifty feet away from organic croplands. DEIS at 396. But there is no data provided to support the notion that herbicide drift is limited to only fifty feet, or that herbicide sprayed over 50 feet away couldn’t otherwise reach organic cropland (e.g., by being washed from the ROW by rain and contaminating soil used for organic crops). The DEIS also states that “to protect organic farms during vegetation management activities once the line is in operation, herbicide would not be applied within portions of the ROW where the landowner does not wish to introduce it.” DEIS at D-2. However, it is unclear whether this gives landowners control only over the application of herbicide on their own property, or whether a landowner could prevent the use of herbicides beyond his or her property lines.

"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources",". J. Visual Quality and Aesthetics The DEIS understates the visual and aesthetic impacts from the proposed transmission line and towers. First, the DEIS examines the impact the proposed transmission line would have on specific scenic resources at specific places in specific parks and nature areas, but does not discuss the importance or value of scenic, natural beauty of the area in general, or how this resource will be impacted. As former Wisconsin State Planning Director and State Energy Director Professor Stephen Born of the University of Wisconsin states in his comments, “a region having a psychic identity in the minds of people and institutions is a critical factor in regional definition,” and the Driftless Area “has taken on a brand name in promoting ecotourism, the regional economy, and the overall quality of life.” For example, in determining the visual impact of the proposed line, the DEIS looks at the number of residences within a 300 feet analysis area (150 from the line on either side)25 and the number of people likely to see the line “from designated overlooks at state parks [and the] Ice Age National Scenic Trail.” DEIS at 316. People who live farther than 150 feet from the transmission line will still be able to see the line and high towers from their homes, their property (which may be within the analysis area, but wouldn’t be counted in the number of residences), and as they travel to and from work, school, errands, and otherwise carry on their daily lives. 25 Note that while the DEIS at page 316 states that it considered the “[n]umber of residences within 300 feet of the C-HC Project,” suggesting that it considered residences within 300 feet in either direction from the actual line, the DEIS on page 318 clarifies that the 300 foot “analysis area” is in fact centered over the line, with only a 150 area considered on either side. Indeed, someone with a home 160 feet from the line was not considered in the analysis, yet is closer to the line than the towers will be tall—namely, 17-stories high. In addition, many people visiting the area and recreational resources will see the line from places other than a “designated overlook.” "

This map is an important way for decisionmakers and the public to understand the visual impact of the line and towers, and should have been included in the DEIS. The DEIS’s qualitative impacts characterizations are also problematic. The DEIS states that for residences outside of the ROW but within the 300 foot analysis area (again, which is 150 feet on either side of the line), visual impacts would only be “moderate.” DEIS at 349. RUS is asserting that if there was a homeowner’s property directly below the line, but the house itself was 155 feet away from the line (that is, close enough to be hit if a pole were to topple), the impact to that property would only be “moderate.” See diagram, showing to scale a 170 foot tower, 150 feet buffer, and a house with peak roof [figure] 150 ft height of 20 feet. It is hard to imagine that the visual and aesthetic impact in this property would not be major. The DEIS also claims that “at the overall project level,” visual resource impacts from the proposed transmission line would be “minor.” It is unclear how it was determined that a high-voltage transmission line, with 17-story towers, cutting a 125-mile swath through the scenic and rural Driftless Area would not have more than a “minor” visual impact. "

"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics"," L. Tourism As an initial matter, the DEIS fails to recognize the way the degradation of the natural and visual environment from this proposed large transmission line would affect tourism to the Driftless Area as a whole—it will go beyond specific discrete impacts to the view at specific, discrete tourism sites. People come to the Driftless Area to experience the natural beauty and rural feel of the area holistically, and the presence of a massive high-voltage transmission line and 17-story high towers will likely depress tourism in the area generally. The DEIS concedes that “specific tourism sites that could experience negative impacts include the Driftless Area,” DEIS at 384, but does not fully account for the fact that the Driftless Area is not a “specific tourism site,” but is rather a region encompassing the whole area through which the transmission line would run. The DEIS fails to recognize that “[t]he maintenance of this regional character will be increasingly important to the growth of recreation, tourism, and sustainable agriculture in the future.” Comments of Emeritus Professor Stephen M. Born, Exhibit H. The DEIS’s failure to account for the holistic experience of living in or touring the Driftless Area is reflected in the limited acknowledgment that the transmission line would have a negative impact on “birdwatching tourism” at the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge during the operations phase.

"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","The DEIS also anticipates no long-term impacts to Blue Mound State Park, stating that it is “approximately 1 mile north” of the proposed route along US 18/151. As seen from this Google map measurement, the closest point of Blue Mound State Park is, in fact, barely half of a mile from the proposed route (2874 feet = 0.54 miles). As noted above in the discussion on Nelson Dewey State Park, reliance on clearly erroneous information in the DEIS for facts as basic as geographic distance raises significant concerns about the accuracy and validity of other information in the DEIS. [map] The tourism analysis is also inadequate because it makes no attempt to try to quantify the actual economic impacts from reductions in tourism, instead simply claiming that operation of the line is “expected to have a minor negative impact on the approximately $1.7 billion in direct visitor spending and approximately $197.5 million in state and local taxes that the analysis area counties receive annually from tourism income.” DEIS at 371. The DEIS cites to a recent article from a peer-reviewed international journal, in which surveys were taken at seven nature-based tourism destination areas in Iceland to determine opinions regarding transmission lines.26 The DEIS cites the article for the statement that “in rural and less developed landscapes, the potential 26 Þorkell Stefánsson et al., When Tourists Meet Transmission Lines: The Effect of Electric Transmission Lines on Tourism in Iceland, Energy Research & Social Science (Dec. 2017), available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317988255_When_tourists_meet_transmission_lines_The_effects_of_elec tric_transmission_lines_on_tourism_in_Iceland. impacts to tourism in these areas would be moderate and long term because the alteration of the landscape could deter visitation from tourists seeking a less developed setting.” DEIS at 370. In fact, the study found that “[p]ower lines have a negative effect on the interest in travelling around the areas of the seven research locations for 62.9–85.9% of tourists.”27 In other words, a significant majority of the surveyed individuals would be deterred from visiting natural areas where a transmission line had been build. “Additionally, respondents were asked what infrastructure could be in place without the concept of wilderness, and/or unspoilt nature, losing its meaning. . . . Around 7.7% of respondents considered that transmission lines can be in place in wilderness.”28 For the idea that transmission lines do not have significant tourism impacts, the DEIS cites to an apparently non-scientific, non-peer-reviewed report that was written for the purpose of supporting a proposed transmission line in its review process before a state agency. DEIS at 371 (referencing a New Hampshire “study” cited as “Nichols Tourism Group 2015,” which presumably refers to Nichols Tourism Group, Northern Pass transmission and New Hampshire’s Tourism Industry (Sept. 2015), available at http://www.northernpass.us/assets/filings/ Volume%20XXXIV/Appendix%2045%20Northern%20Pass%20Transmission%20and%20New%20Hampshires%20Tourism%20Industry.pdf). 2. Property Values RUS’s analysis of property value impacts of the proposed transmission line is similarly insufficient. Context matters significantly when it comes to the impact of transmission lines on the value of nearby properties. The presence of a transmission line and 17-story high towers 27 Stefánsson, supra, at 6. 28 Id. at 6. through a scenic natural and rural area—an area that people live in and visit precisely because of its natural beauty—will impact property values much more significantly than it would in a highly developed urban area. The DEIS fails to acknowledge or reflect this reality. The DEIS cites a 2007 paper by Pitts and Jackson, which found that the value of properties adjacent to transmission lines only decreased between 2% and 7%—yet the article is not clear about whether the studies it references for its conclusions are in urban, suburban, or rural areas. DEIS at 372. Further, in contrast to the assumptions made in the DEIS, the article states that “[t]he value diminution on lots adjacent to or with direct views on a tower may not decrease with time.”29 The DEIS also cites to a 2009 article by Chalmers and Voorvaart, which looked at the impacts of 130-foot transmission structures—significantly smaller than the 17-story towers that would support the Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line. DEIS at 372."
"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics"," Yet at the same time, the DEIS ignores a more recent article by Chalmers that DALC referenced in its scoping comments to RUS, which found that property values for residential properties up to 1,000 feet away fell by 15%.30 Notably, the DEIS only considers the number of residential buildings within 150 feet from the transmission line when discussing property value impacts. See, e.g., DEIS at 374. The DEIS also ignored a valuation guidance report by Appraisal Group One that DALC cited in its scoping comments, which included a review of many empirical studies, including several from Wisconsin. This report concluded that “it can be stated with a high degree of 29 Jennifer Pitts and Thomas Jackson, Power Lines and Property Values Revisited at 324, The Appraisal Journal (Jan. 2007). 30 James A. Chalmers, Transmission Line Impacts on Rural Property Value, Right of Way (May/June 2012), http://eweb.irwaonline.org/eweb/upload/web_mayjune12_Transmission.pdf. certainty that there is a significant negative effect ranging from -10% to -30% of property value due to the presence of the high voltage electric transmission line.”31 The DEIS’s reference to a study that found that an adjacent high-voltage transmission line corridor could increase property values is misleading. The context for this study was likely developed urban or suburban areas with smaller than rural lot sizes, where open space is limited, and the existence of a transmission line will prevent development of directly adjacent property. An abutting right-of-way can, in that instance, provide “improved visual clearance, increased privacy, and larger lot sizes.”32 In a rural and small-town setting, a right-of-way would not provide any of these benefits, but instead would simply detract from the aesthetics of the communities and countryside. Further, the DEIS makes no attempt to estimate the actual total monetary value of the diminished values of the numerous pieces of property due to the proposed transmission line and 17-story high towers.

"SOCIO04","Environmental Justice","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","3. Environmental Justice The EIS’s discussion of environmental justice impacts does not thoroughly explain its assumptions and does not engage in the level of detailed analysis necessary to determine whether communities of concern would be disproportionately impacted. The EIS identifies an area as an environmental justice community if the county’s minority or low income population percentage is at least 20% or greater than the state’s overall minority or low income population. DEIS at 363. However, the choice of this metric seems to defy common sense for several reasons. First, a county is a large unit of analysis, and it is entirely possible that the statistics at the county level mask large inequalities that occur within the county. The DEIS does not even attempt to explain why a county was chosen as the unit of analysis, and the FEIS should discuss whether data on income level, or some other metric that could be used as a proxy for income—such as home value, or percentage of children receiving free or reduced price lunches in public schools—is available at more granular geographic level. "
"SOCIO04","Environmental Justice","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Second, RUS has not explained its decision to use the U.S. Census Bureau’s poverty threshold as its metric for low income populations. The poverty threshold is low enough—$24,339 (2016 dollars) for a family consisting of two adults and two children—that many households above the poverty level may still struggle to afford housing—median home value in Wisconsin is $167,000—and other basic life necessities. DEIS at 363. The DEIS’s analysis of impacts to the only environmental justice community it identifies—Grant County, which has a poverty level at least 20% greater than the state’s poverty rate percentage—demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of environmental justice. The DEIS concludes that there will be no “disproportionate impacts” to Grant County because “the potential negative impacts from the proposed transmission line and facilities experienced in Grant County would be the same in nature and intensity as those experienced by all other analysis area counties.” DEIS at 372. Comparing Grant County to other counties in the analysis area—that is, other counties through which the transmission line would run—misses the point of an environmental justice review. Environmental justice communities face disproportionate impacts when undesirable or environmentally-damaging projects, such as landfills, transmission lines, or polluting factories are located in those communities instead of in communities with higher incomes and lower percentage of minority populations. Without comparing Grant County to other counties that do not contain multiple high voltage transmission lines, RUS cannot conclude that Grant County faces no disproportionate impact from transmission lines. Additionally, if a low income community and a high income community experience impacts that are “the same in nature and intensity,” those impacts may have a disproportionate effect on the low income community."

While severe weather information may be relevant to the fire risk, the information provided here is outdated and not sufficient to provide any meaningful analysis. Importantly, the DEIS fails to even mention the fact that climate change will likely lead to an increasing risk of fire. Climate change will impact fire risk in multiple ways in the Midwest—both by creating an environment in which fires can rapidly take hold and spread, and by increasing the likelihood of lightning strikes and severe weather, which can start fires when they damage transmission lines. Precipitation will increase during wet seasons, and will contribute to vegetation growth, but this vegetation will likely dry out and die during hotter summer days. Warmer temperatures will also increase insect outbreaks and tree mortality, leading to greater accumulation of fuel. This provides an ideal situation for more severe wildfires.33 Climate change will also cause more frequent and extreme severe weather (such as high winds, hail, tornadoes), which can damage transmission lines or structures and result in fires. Further, warmer weather is also linked to greater frequency of lightning strikes due to increased evapotranspiration.34 See DEIS at 389.

The San Francisco “Camp Fire” in late 2018 may have been caused by a transmission line, and in 2017, PG&E transmission lines were the probable cause of 17 fires.36 Just as climate change increases fire risk from transmission lines in the western U.S., as the Midwest climate shifts, leading to longer droughts and more extreme weather events, occurrence and severity of wildfires will increase. 33 Brad Neumann, Climate Change and Wildfire in the Great Lakes Region, Michigan State University Extension, https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/resources/pdfs/e-3277_wcag_2_aa.pdf. 34 34 David Romps, Jacob Seely, David Vollaro, and John Molinari, Projected increase in lightning strikes in the United States due to global warming, Science (November, 2014), http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6211/851 (number of lightning strikes in the United States could increase by roughly 12 percent for every degree Celsius of warming). 35 John Abatzoglou and Park Williams, Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forest Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (October, 2016), https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770.abstract. 36 David Baker, What’s Causing California’s Annual Wildfires, Bloomberg (Nov. 13, 2018), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/why-california-wildfires-put-heat-on-power-companies-quicktake.

DEIS at 408. First, if a person was standing in the Refuge near Oak Road, then Wisconsin would be to the east, not to the west. Second, Oak Road is a narrow dirt road, and significantly less visually intrusive than a massive new high-voltage transmission line with a 260 foot wide right-of-way and 17-story high towers. The descriptions of the alternative-specific impacts are also highly flawed. For example, for Alternative 1, the DEIS acknowledges that it would create “long-term, major adverse impacts to scenic resources within the Refuge.” DEIS at 422. Yet it claims that the transmission line would be in the “middle-ground” for viewers traveling along Oak Road. DEIS at 422. In fact, the transmission line would follow Oak Road, making the infrastructure clearly in the foreground for individuals on the road. The DEIS also states, without support, that “[r]ecreation activities are expected to return to preconstruction levels after construction ends.” DEIS at 421. The discussion of impacts to this National Refuge also repeats several flaws found in other sections of the DEIS. On page 413, the DEIS lists possible impacts, such as erosion, but does not disclose the likelihood of such impacts or the degree / severity of the impacts. The DEIS also states that various impacts would be short term if repaired, but does not describe repair methods or likelihood of success. See, e.g., DEIS at 419. The DEIS also seems to assume that there will be no impacts to eagles as long as the transmission line is not sited close to an active nest. DEIS at 421. What about collisions from bald eagles that frequently fly through the area? Finally, the DEIS claims that there will be benefits from the proposed route that would include the retirement of an existing transmission line through the refuge, yet does not even mention impacts from the construction activities required to take down the existing line and associated infrastructure. DEIS at 421. "
"SOCIO02","Jobs","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Up until late 2015, Cassville, Wisconsin was home to two power plants, generating over 200 MW of power for homes and businesses throughout the region.  These power plants employed approximately 100 people which doesn't even factor in the supporting jobs created elsewhere in the community to serve the operational needs of these two plants.  According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Cassville had a population of 947.  Losing 100 jobs in a community of 947 has been *detrimental* to the economy of Cassville.  Not one of those 100 jobs has been recreated as of March 2019.

To add insult to injury, American Transmission Co., ITC Midwest, and Dairyland Power Cooperative want to construct the Mississippi River crossing of the 345-kV Cardinal-Hickory Creek Transmission Line at the site of one of those two power plants.  Should the line get built, one of those sites will not be able to be redeveloped for a future business or industry.  Cassville needs jobs.  Cassville needs young families.  Cassville needs an expanded tax base to survive.  Construction of Cardinal-Hickory Creek will *not* provide these needs and will only rub salt in Cassville's wounds."
"EFF02","Cumulative Effects Analysis","EFF","Effects Analysis","N. Cumulative An EIS must include comprehensive analysis of cumulative actions and cumulative impacts. 40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.25(a)(2) and (c)(3). The DEIS’s analysis of cumulative impacts is inadequate. The geographical area is too limited and the nature and extent of many cumulative actions and impacts are not fully and fairly addressed. The EIS must analyze all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects in the area and explain how these projects and other circumstances may, in combination with the proposed transmission line, cause cumulative impacts in the region. The DEIS does not adequately analyze the cumulative impacts of the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line in combination with all other recently-built or planned transmission lines and electricity infrastructure projects. As explained in Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. F.E.R.C., 753 F.3d 1304, 1319 (D.C. Cir. 2014), a cumulative impacts analysis must consider “other actions—past, present, and proposed, and reasonably foreseeable—that have had or are expected to have impacts in the same area,” along with “the impacts or expected impacts from these other actions,” and “the overall impact that can be expected if the individual impacts are allowed to accumulate.” In Delaware Riverkeeper, the court overturned an EIS that failed to consider the cumulative impacts of a pipeline project in conjunction with three other pipeline projects in the area. Id. at 1320. "
"EFF03","Addition of Project(s) to Cumulative Effects Scenario","EFF","Effects Analysis","The DEIS here must consider cumulative impacts from other transmission line projects in the area. For example, the large Badger-Coulee transmission line that also connects to the Cardinal substation also traverses the Driftless Area. The proposed SOO Green Renewable Rail line is proposed to be built in the same overall area. The proposed Grain Belt and Rock Island transmission lines are also in the planning and development processes. Among other things, the existence of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable high-voltage transmission lines should be accounted for and quantified in RUS’s analysis of whether the Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line will really provide sufficiently large incremental reliability benefits to justify its significant adverse environmental impact costs. The DEIS acknowledges that the Badger Coulee would “alleviate constraints on the existing 345-kV system and on the 138- and 161-kV systems in southwest Wisconsin and Iowa.” DEIS at 430. This must be factored into the discussion of whether there is truly a need for the proposed Cardinal-Hickory Creek line, when the Badger Coulee, which is now up and running, has the same benefits as are being used to justify the Cardinal-Hickory Creek line.

Additionally, an open-access transmission line which may carry fossil-fuel-generated electricity may be at cross-purposes with increasing the clean renewable energy capacity within Wisconsin. "

"EFF04","Mitigation/Environmental Commitments","EFF","Effects Analysis"," VII. MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION The inadequacy of the mitigation and remediation information and measures is discussed above in the context of specific resource impacts. There is, overall, a lack of adequate information in the DEIS about mitigation and remediation, lack of commitment to specific measures, and failure to provide any evidence of the effectiveness of proposed measures. RUS must “seek to mitigate potential adverse environmental impacts resulting from Agency actions” and ensure that “[a]ll mitigation measures will be included in Agency commitment or decision documents.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.16. CEQ regulations require that agency records of decision for which an EIS was prepared must “[s]tate whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not. A monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.” 40 C.F.R. § 1505.2. The DEIS refers the reader to Appendix D for information on Best Management Practices. For the most part, however, this document simply lists what best management practices might include in various circumstances. It does not identify or commit to specific measures for this proposed transmission line. It also lists possible BMPs that have already apparently been rejected, such as undergrounding the transmission line beneath waterways. DEIS at D-9. "
"EFF04","Mitigation/Environmental Commitments","EFF","Effects Analysis","Appendix D does little to clarify issues around mitigation and remediation. The DEIS’s discussion of alternatives also does not “[i]nclude appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.” 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(f). RUS has also not made clear how it will fulfill its duty to “monitor implementation of all mitigation measures during development of design, final plans, inspections during the construction phase of projects, as well as in future servicing visits.” 7 C.F.R. § 1970.16. CEQ guidance on mitigation states that “mitigation commitments should be carefully specified in terms of measurable performance standards or expected results,”38 and that agencies should implement a mitigation monitoring program that both “tracks whether mitigation commitments are being performed as described in the NEPA and related decision documents (i.e., implementation monitoring), and whether the mitigation effort is producing the expected outcomes and resulting environmental effects (i.e., effectiveness monitoring).”39 Fully describing these aspects of proposed mitigation is important because, without appropriate documentation and monitoring, “the use of mitigation may fail to advance NEPA’s purpose of ensuring informed and transparent environmental decisionmaking. Failure to document and monitor mitigation may also undermine the integrity of the NEPA review.”40 The DEIS does not explain what will happen to the transmission infrastructure after the 40 year “life” of the project. Will the transmission line, 17-story high towers and other structures be removed? Will they be left up? Will the developers continue to maintain the ROW? This important consideration is completely neglected in the DEIS. 38 Council on Environmental Quality, Appropriate Use of Mitigation and Monitoring and Clarifying the Appropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No Significant Impact, at 8, https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/Mitigation_and_Monitoring_Guidance_14Jan2011.pdf. 39 Id. at 11. 40 Id. at 2.

It fails to comply with the requirements of NEPA and implementing regulations. With due respect, the RUS decisionmakers and the public deserve a better environmental impact statement that fully and fairly analyzes the adverse environmental impacts and issues explained above and provides an objective evaluation of all reasonable alternatives. That would lead to more informed decisionmaking by federal and state officials, and a better informed public as Congress sought to achieve in NEPA.

Even if the proposed transmission line route along US 18/151 does not directly overlap these important conservation areas, selection of that route could have significant impacts on the success of the conservation and restoration efforts. The Nature Conservancy states that: The Military Ridge Prairie Heritage Area (MRPHA) is a 95,000+ acre grassland landscape in Dane and Iowa counties in southwest Wisconsin. The area provides habitat for 14 rare and declining grassland bird species and contains more than 60 prairie remnants, representing one of the highest concentrations of native grasslands in the Midwest. The agricultural history of the area has helped keep the landscape much as it was when the first settlers saw it and has made it possible for plants and animals like grassland birds, which have disappeared in more developed parts of the Midwest, to survive.

The mitigating actions to all the concerns from environmental, to socio economic, to cultural, etc. can never really be mitigated or compensated for either in physical restoration or in dollars.

The mitigations are band-aids, enabling everything left in the wake to suffer including wetlands, woodlands, tallus slopes, special and rare status plants and animals, geology and soils, noise, and an enduring visual impact. I have lived in the area now 40 years and I see first hand what these practices do and the long-term effects of pesticide use and poor land management. There is no coming back from disturbing our environment to the degree ATC is proposing. 
Even the “low impact” items listed are really not “low impact” for an individual landowner. For example, I am still dealing with the mess (impacted soil, grass restoration, surface ruts, etc) that was made on my property when KDL placed fiber optic cable from Reedsburg to Dodgeville 8 years ago. They completed a “restoration” but our quality standards are not the same. I had labor costs, seed costs, drainage repair costs, machinery costs. These events have lasting negative long-term effects.

We seriously question the data in the DEIS that indicate increasing energy demand. Shouldn’t the DEIS also include data to address the opposing assessment of decreasing energy demand?
 Even if energy demand increases in the future, there are better and more cost‐effective alternatives, including improved energy efficiencies, and locally generated wind and solar power. With wind turbines and solar panels throughout all appropriate locales, not as much electricity would need to be moved across long distances and this new high‐voltage transmission line would not be necessary.
 One argument for the CHC line is to move power (including wind energy) from western states where it is more abundant to eastern states where it is needed. Can’t the wind power be moved on existing lines? Can’t more renewable energy sources be developed in eastern states?
 The CHC line is one of 17 new high‐voltage line projects that have been or are being built in the Midwest, including a “sister project,” the Badger‐Coulee Project, from North La Crosse to North Madison. Given the large number of new lines, why not eliminate construction of this CHC line?

"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","One of the many reasons I oppose this project is that I believe that nontransmission alternatives have not been fully examined in the draft EIS, both singly and in combination. In chapter section 2.2.2.1 (Regional and Local Renewable Electricity Generation), the federal dEIS states that “peak load often extends into summer nights as well, when photo voltaic systems stop generating electricity. Thus, without sufficient power storage capacity, residential solar systems have limited usefulness in resolving the identified grid reliability deficiencies in the region.” I would like to note that this chapter section is maybe a page in length, and, in its brevity, dismisses the myriad ways of structuring local and regional power generation that could be examined as alternatives to the construction of this wasteful high voltage power line. To address the point the above paragraph attempts to make, it is my understanding that what is holding Wisconsin homeowners back in terms of storing their own energy from daytime generation for use overnight is the pricing and contract structures that the utility companies offer their customers that install solar panels. In some other states or with other utility companies, it is more incentivized to purchase a battery for energy storage for a home, and the homeowner can save money that way and actually use the battery to offset peak usage from the grid. That utilities have free reign to set policies that effectively tie their customers to the grid, even if they have purchased solar panels for electrical generation to attempt to meet some of their own energy needs, is an issue that must be looked at before 175 ft tall high voltage transmission lines are built across the Driftless Area. This CHC project is admitted in the dEIS to be only one part of MVP #5 which MISO has apparently been implementing for the past several years. Millions of dollars have already been spent on the project to construct other segments and electrical generation facilities. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","Damage to the aesthetic beauty and rural character of our environment: We believe that the CHC line will harm the beauty of our nationally unique Driftless Area. We want everyone to continue to see beautiful rolling hills, farms with their barns and cows, deer in the woods, trout streams, and prairie wildflowers, all without the massive transmission line. We want to maintain the current beauty of rural Wisconsin and preserve it for generations to come.
 The photographs provided in the DEIS are deceptive. Several simulated photos show the transmission line from a great distance, not what would be seen while walking or driving nearby. The simulated photo of a residential neighborhood in the town of Cassville only shows a pole, not the looming presence of the entire tower and lines.
 The DEIS states that the transmission line will be visible from the Great River Road and the Ice Age National Scenic Trail. However, there is no acknowledgement of the fact that the CHC line will mar the landscape for everyone who lives near it or drives along the corridor."
"EFF02","Cumulative Effects Analysis","EFF","Effects Analysis","The DEIS states that it is “likely that the current project would be seen as an opportunity site for the construction of additional transmission features.” We do not want to experience the future ongoing degradation of our environment."
"PUB01","General Public Involvement","PUB","Public Involvement","Insufficient emphasis on public input: The overwhelming public outcry against the CHC transmission line is not addressed. Because people are part of the environment, the DEIS should present a detailed summary of public opposition to the CHC line, including the number of people who signed various petitions, submitted comments to state and federal agencies, and attended public meetings; a listing of governmental agencies and organizations who oppose the CHC transmission line and descriptions of their efforts, including the number of meetings held and their attendance; and the number of billboards and yard signs in the CHC transmission line area."
"PUB01","General Public Involvement","PUB","Public Involvement","I question why we in the Driftless are only able to comment now on the project, why we were not asked in combination with all the other areas affected by all the other segments of the project about our willingness to pay for and build such a thing at its inception.

"DECI01","General Decision Process","DECI","Decision Process","MISO and the Utilities have the vast majority of the situational “power,” to lay plans in advance, to build neighboring sections, and then point to the sections being already built as driving the supposed “need” for this CHC section. I find this current treatment of the project, getting approval locale by locale to be truly ironic because the argument for the line is to reinforce largescale infrastructure rather than improving grid concept and structure on a local and regional level. I propose that the approval process should be matched to the scope of MVP #5, and other projects like it. I also would like to remind the reader that this project is guaranteeing certain shareholders a large profit, that it is not a notforprofit venture being undertaken for the public good. "
"WLDLF01","General Wildlife","WLDLF","Wildlife","Another admission in the dEIS (2.4.1.2) is that there is expected harm to avian wildlife brought about by the design of the lines and accompanying 175 ft. poles being proposed, and that this harm would be ameliorated in portions crossing a wildlife refuge by changing the structure of that segment to a lower, wider profile. Since birds do not actually acknowledge the boundaries of wildlife sanctuaries, I propose that those same birds would be colliding with the higher, narrower structures along the rest of the route and that changing the profile of the lines within a small section does not actually solve the problem. And, this is just one tiny fraction of the harm that would come to our state’s wildlife and natural resources should the lines be installed. "
"AIR04","Climate Change","AIR","Air Quality","Overall, we as a nation and world need to prioritize funding projects that cause an immediate drop in CO2 emissions to combat climate change, the CHC line does not meet this criterion. The environmental consequences with regard to climate change of building this line, continuing the same longdistance inefficient infrastructure that carries a mix of fossil fuel generated electricity with a small portion of renewable, are dire and would make no change to the CO2 being released to the atmosphere. Another local concern to the human environment is the recent finding that a large percentage of our rural wells in Southwest Wisconsin are contaminated with coliform bacteria and nitrates. We should examine the cause of this crisis, and work to make sure that any utility infrastructure projects do not exacerbate the pollution. "
"VIS01","General Visual Resources","VIS","Visual Resources","Finally, I want to stress that the poor aesthetics of this project is a factor that drives much of the harm that we would experience here in the Driftless Area. Not only would the lines pose a threat to human and plant/animal health and safety, but the looming ugliness of the lines would cause clear, significant harm to land values, tourism, and the economy of the region.

"ALT02","Proposed Action","ALT","Alternatives","Underground transmission lines produce lower magnetic fields than aboveground lines
because the underground conductors are placed closer together, which causes the magnetic
fields created by each of the three conductors to cancel out some of the others’ fields. This
results in reduced magnetic fields (PSCW 2011).
(CMT); Above ground lines must also be placed closer together to reduced magnetic fields ,
but that would reduce the applicants return on investment. The WPSC completely ignored our
requests to look into ROW widths. The PSC head of gas and electric, Jeff Ripp, wrote in a letterthat ROW width was negotiable through the easement. This of course was a lie. We were to
work with Jeff Ripp on ROW width but PSC lawyer Mike Varda emailed us to not contact Mr.
Ripp again. He then sent us on wild goose chase to MISO’s Miggie E. Cramblit who was not in
the least equipped to answer our queries.
According to IEEE; “ Standard phase spacing should also be taken into account. For
example, if two lines of the same voltage using the same type structures and phase conductors
are on a single ROW, a logical separation of the two closest phases of the two lines should be
at least the standard phase separation of the structure.” The standard phase 5 separation of the
structure is twelve feet (vert= nine feet). ATC demanded forty five feet and the WPSC granted it."

I must note that I, like almost everyone, uses and appreciates the many things that safe, reliable electricity brings to modern life both for uses that are necessities as well as those that could be considered luxury. Reasonable cost and environmentally friendly power is important as well. I am not an expert or even very knowledgeable about the rules governing such matters, but from my understanding the American Transmission Company (ATC) is a joint venture owned by the utilities that generate electricity. I have also been informed that ATC does not make any money unless they build transmission lines and that they are guaranteed a certain return on such construction. If that is the case I wonder how impartial the assessment of need for the construction would be. I have heard and wonder if the needs have changed since the original proposal and plans of the line. There was recent news that allowed ATC to recover certain costs for planning and approval if the proposed line were not constructed. Might that indicate that circumstances have changed?

It appeared on the ATC aerial map of the Powell Family Farmland that there are 2 subsegment end points. Presently it is believed the Powell Farmland does not have any utility lines on their property. It appears both of these subsegment end points are located just inside the Powell Family Farm line fences, on the northeast and northwest border, of the Powell Family Farmland property. It seems unreasonable that 2 subsegments end points should be located on one property. The Q03 and Q04 subsegment endpoints could be located on neighboring property owners land; to the east of the Powell Property, in the City of Dodgeville, there is a parcel of 3.3 acres that Q04 subsegment end point could be located on and to the west of the Powell property, in the Township of Dodgeville, there are numerous points located west, beyond Lehner Road, that the second subsegment end point, Q03, could be located on.

The Project is Needed to Support Renewable Energy Resources that are Necessary to Achieve State Clean Energy Goals This Project is needed to enable additional renewable energy resources on the transmission system and to help “meet state renewable portfolio standards and support the nation’s changing energy mix.” 1 Thus far, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa have met the requirements of their renewable portfolio standards. However, additional wind resources will be needed to meet other public policy requirements beyond these states’ renewable portfolio standards. Minnesota has a statutory goal of reducing GHG emissions by 80 percent by 2050.2 Both Minnesota and Wisconsin have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, which aims to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and requires at least a 26-28 percent decrease in GHG emissions by 2025. Neither state is currently on track to meet these climate goals.3,4 Additional wind resources will also be needed to meet stronger policy goals in the future. In recent months, lawmakers in Illinois,5 Minnesota,6 and Wisconsin7 have proposed plans to reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. Meeting these goals will require a significant increase in renewable energy penetration throughout the Midcontinent region, which in turn will require expanded transmission to support the new wind and solar resources. Finally, additional renewable resources will also continue to come online for economic reasons, as the cost of wind technology continues to drop. According to Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis in 2018, building new onshore wind generation is now cost-competitive with running existing coal plants, and running existing wind farms is significantly cheaper than running coal plants.8 This data shows that renewable energy is quickly becoming the cheapest option for utilities and their customers. This increase in renewable energy—driven by policy as well as economics—is illustrated by the significant renewable generation in the MISO Interconnection Queue. Figure 1 below illustrates the amount of generation in the queue across MISO regions by fuel type. In all regions—and particularly in the West region, which includes Minnesota, Iowa and Western Wisconsin—wind and solar dominate all other technologies.

We are concerned about the impact of the proposed transmission line on the Southwest Wisconsin Grassland and Stream Conservation Area, which is located immediately to the south of the proposed transmission line that runs through the town of Springdale. http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/grasslands/swgrassland.html http://swgsca.org/ Southwestern Wisconsin has been recognized for many years as one of the best grassland conservation opportunities in the Upper Midwest. The area stands out for its distinctive combination of resources: exceptional populations of grassland birds, which are in serious decline across their range; many scattered remnants of the area's original prairie and savanna that once covered the region; concentrations of rare plants and animals, and spring-fed streams, all set within this expansive rural farming region of open fields, croplands, oak groves, and pastures. These disappearing habitats, bird populations, and varied natural assets merit protection and would be threatened by the proposed transmission line. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has joined with a diverse group of conservation partners, local governments, and landowners in southwestern Wisconsin to establish a habitat conservation area known as the Southwest Wisconsin Grassland and Stream Conservation Area (SWGSCA). The SWGSCA protects 12,000 acres, expanding on an existing grassland boundary for the federal Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), a voluntary set-aside program aimed at buffering area streams. SWGSCA is a partnership between local, state, federal, non-profit organizations, landowners, and individual citizens, all working together towards the common goal of sustaining functional grasslands, savannas, and stream habitats. We also are concerned about the impact of the proposed transmission line on the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, so called because it was never touched by glaciers and, as a result, has no glacial deposits or “drift,” the silt, clay, sand, gravel and boulders left behind by glaciers. The unique driftless geology of this large area of south central and southwestern Wisconsin has created a varied and beautiful topography over tens of thousands of years. The area is home to environmentally-significant cold-water trout streams and wetlands. Its forests, prairie remnants and grasslands provide habitat for a range of wildflowers and wildlife. "

On behalf of our constituents, we have reviewed the potential effect of the transmission line on the Mount Horeb area and have been working to persuade state regulators to reject the proposal. We believe there would be a negative economic impact on our community’s future. When a HVTL is built near a community, property values there decline, whether the line directly affects the property or not. Property owners may be unable to sell their homes and land at the price they deserve. A decline in property tax revenue requires local governments (county, school district, village) to find ways to replace that revenue, often at the expense of other properties in the community."

The ability to add new businesses and housing is diminished when HVTL lines are built through and next to a community like ours. So, new construction is limited and tax rates could go up. This is a recipe for financial disaster. It is important for all of us to address these potential impacts while we still have the chance. But time is running out.

"LAND01","General Land Use","LAND","Land Use","1. The Town of Springdale has a land use plan, adopted in March of 2002, that reflects the values and goals of our citizens and is intended to preserve the rural character of our town. Through consensus and compromise, the volunteer leadership and citizens of Springdale developed a land use plan that reflects our core values. This plan provides guidelines to the local town government from its citizens regarding how land use decisions should be made. The Springdale plan commission continues to make its land use decisions based on this document. The most significant shared value we agreed on is that we wish to preserve the rural character of Springdale. We encourage you to appreciate the strong emotions that questions of land use engender in a rural municipality. A variety of perspectives on property rights and appropriate land use must be considered and accommodated. The development of our land use plan was a long and sometimes contentious process that involved thousands of volunteer hours, along with input from a great number of our citizens. Two drafts were disseminated, with public comments encouraged. During the eleven-month period from May 2001 to March 2002, the town conducted 10 information meetings, 30 citizen committee work sessions, three plan commission work sessions with the citizen committees, two public input sessions, and one public hearing. When the Springdale land use plan went before the Dane County Board of Supervisors for approval, the plan was praised for its innovative approach and incorporation of conservation subdivisions. A Dane County supervisor said, “In some ways, this (plan) may be the best plan that’s ever come to this board. This is one of the few land use plans in Dane County that will be enforced primarily by land division ordinance. And that’s innovative.” The Springdale land use plan has these stated objectives, among others: • To preserve the agricultural land, open spaces, and other natural resources of a rural town • To respect environmentally sensitive areas and culturally significant sites • And to prohibit large commercial development and industrial development. The plan is a living document. During the 17 years since the plan was adopted, it has been reviewed every year, but never challenged."

Residential developments must be built off of farmland and in less obtrusive sites. • Given our varied typography, characterized by rolling hills, forests, wetlands, and rich farmland, a 345 -kV transmission line would directly conflict with the town’s land use plan. A high-voltage line would be visible for miles from many vantage points—hardly blending in with the landscape as our land use plan requires of new structures. • Previous environmental impact studies we have seen define “affected households” as those that are within either 150 feet or 300 feet of the proposed transmission line. We encourage you to consider the fact that the visual impact of transmission towers and lines extends significantly beyond that distance in environmentally rich, rural areas such as the town of Springdale, where our topography includes rolling hills, forests, wetlands, and rich farmland. Neither 150 feet nor 300 feet are adequate measures for capturing the impact on our visual landscape."

Before the authors even began to write the draft, they were biased in favor of building the Cardinal Hickory Creek transmission line. Why? Because the United States Department of Agriculture hired out the work to a subcontractor, SWCA Environmental Associates, a company that supports transmission companies! Two years ago I attended the USDA Scoping meetings in Dodgeville for Cardinal-Hickory Creek. I assumed the purpose of an environmental impact statement would be to determine first and foremost if a proposed project is worthy of being built. Is it needed and will it have some benefit to the public? I expected to be able to state my concerns about building such an obtrusive, destructive, and expensive project that seemed to be unneeded. A scoping staff person was standing by a display describing CHC in glowing terms. It felt like I was back at ATC’s Open House listening to all their propaganda. I was confused because I assumed scoping for an EIS would be unbiased. I asked if she worked for the transmission companies. She answered she worked for SWCA. I went home and read the following on SWCA’s website: “SWCA provides complete environmental services to support all types of electric transmission projects, from routing, siting, and permitting new lines to rebuild and capacity-increase projects. Faced with issues such as multistate line crossings, the complex mix of public and private land ownership for line siting, and the visual impact of lines for communities, transmission project owners can benefit from SWCA’s proficiency with federal regulations, understanding of the legal intricacies of each state, and ability to address transmission-related environmental impacts.” (Bolding mine.)

As stated in the EPA document, Appendix A Responsiveness Summary Refuse Hideaway Landfill ROD, reply to a question about a proposed development stated, ""If the groundwater contamination does spread due to pumping by the golf course well, or because of the density of private wells in the development, the developer may be liable under Superfund laws for the movement of the contamination and might therefore be considered a Potentially Responsible Party."" This proposed property was northeast of the Superfund Site. As stated in the same EPA document, page 26, ""Groundwater flow indicates that contaminated groundwater has the potential to flow through the wells in the Deer Run Heights neighborhood, located approximately one mile west southwest of the Site."" The proposed ATC powerline project will disturb the environment directly between the Superfund Site and the Deer Run Heights neighborhood, thereby potentially disturbing the contaminated groundwater plume and contaminating our drinking, cooking, and bathing water with toxins (carcinogenic) from ""approximately 1.2 million cubic yards"" of ""commercial and industrial wastes including: ""full barrels of glue and paint, barrels of ink and ink washes, spray paint booth byproducts and paint stripper sludge, and spill residue containing VOCs. In addition, large volumes of municipal wastes from cities and towns in Dane County were also disposed of at the landfill."" (p. 3, EPA ROD document.)

Every section lead to unanswered questions. After spending over 50 hours trying to get through the report and verify and fact check, I am absolutely convinced that this line is a boondoggle. Transmission is important. So are energy efficiency and non-transmission alternatives. CHC is the 5th “Miso Value Project in Iowa. And, there are at least two more of these projects in the works. All these projects claim to improve reliability, relieve congestion, allow import and export of wind generation, and provide regional delivery of renewable energy and reduce energy costs. Many of these projects have led to additional line expansion of lesser kV capacity. Alliant Energy is now asking for an 11.7% rate hike in Iowa, ostensibly to do all the things just stated, and reduce energy costs. None of the planning in Iowa embraces a pathway that promotes CO2 reduction through energy efficiencies and non-transmission alternatives. I am greatly concerned that this present expansion path is turning the rural heartland into an industrial wasteland. Request: Ask Dairyland Cooperative to come up with a plan that does not build this line – an honest and thorough plan that brings rural communities to the table to find cost savings and shared energy opportunities. That might be a plan I would support, because it would be inclusive of the needs of the people of rural Iowa and Wisconsin. "

Final Comment: Having walked many properties on the proposed route, having driven the full length of the route, having talked to individuals all along its path, I was struck by the sense of profound pride our rural communities have in their unique settings, deeply saddened by the feelings of helplessness these folks have, and their justifiable concerns about their land being taken and the possible impacts on the well-being of their children, livestock and the habitats in which they reside. The driftless region has a certain wild beauty found few other places in the Midwest. None of that tenor was conveyed in the pages of the report. I kept searching for something that really captures the essence of the Upper Mississippi River Wildlife Refuge and the people and places of the driftless; some word or phrase that properly conveys the great sorrow communities along the proposed route are experiencing at a potential loss of something truly nameless. I would invite all the folks who worked on preparing the report to come spend a day or two in the driftless region and find out for yourselves what will go missing should this line be built."
"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics"," I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed Cardinal Hickory Creek high voltage transmission line which is planned to stretch across an area of southwestern Wisconsin from Cassville to Middleton. I have many concerns with this proposed project, and the more I learn about the project, the more I oppose it. There are numerous reasons to oppose it, including damage to the environment, damage to the economy (especially agriculture and tourism), and lack of demonstrated need for the line. "
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","I have yet to learn of any convincing reasons that this power line should be built. Perhaps the most important reason this line should not be built is the lack of a need for it. If there is a need for the line, that has not been explained sufficiently in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, and should be addressed in the final version of the EIS. In sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the dEIS (the need summary), it mentions studies undertaken between 2008 and 2011. Those studies were undertaken 8‐11 years ago. Those studies are out of date in 2019, due to the rapid development of renewable energy technology."
"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","One of the purposes of the CHC high voltage transmission line according to the dEIS, is to transfer wind‐generated power. From pages 15 and 16 of the dEIS (section 2.2): “…study efforts…have focused on how to move wind‐generated energy from high wind areas in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota to load Cardinal‐Hickory Creek 345 kV Transmission Line Project Alternatives Evaluation Study July 2016 16 centers throughout the MISO footprint. As states have enacted renewable portfolio standards and goals (“RPSs”) and the country shifts its energy mix to reduce carbon emissions, the need for additional renewable energy and the ability to transfer this energy has increased and is forecasted to continue to rise.” However, this plan to transfer large amounts of energy across the country seems outdated for two reasons. First, there is enormous untapped potential for generating renewable energy close to home (I will elaborate more on that below). Second, electrical grids are vulnerable, both from hacking by malicious forces and from damage due to storms, which are predicted to increase in intensity due to climate change. In addition, around 2% of the electricity is lost when transmitted long distances. According to the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters, renewable energy is an under‐ developed opportunity for Wisconsin. Currently, only 10.2 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity is generated from renewable sources. However, it is technically possible for locally‐produced renewable energy to supply all of Wisconsin’s energy needs. (https://www.wisconsinacademy.org/content/renewableenergy) If it is one of the primary goals of the CHC transmission line to enhance renewable energy transmission across the country, that should be stated more clearly and concretely in the final EIS.

"EFF03","Addition of Project(s) to Cumulative Effects Scenario","EFF","Effects Analysis","Hi, I have written and been to one of the public meetings about the transmission line and I think today is the last day for public comment. I was made aware of yet another transmission company putting a line in the same area of Iowa. I think these transmission lines need to be controlled a little better and communicate with each other. Direct Connect Development Company announced the SOO Green Renewable Rail project which will be underground and following rail routes from Mason City Iowa to Plano,IL It will follow the rail route through Guttenberg. It will be perpendicular where the Cardinal-Hickory Creek crosses the Mississippi then run parallel until the Hickory Creek substation. This is a better idea through the Driftless area since it follows railroads and will be buried than the Cardina-lHickory Creek line. Please don't make the Driftless area a maze of transmission lines. Do not approve so many of these lines. Vote no for Cardinal Hickory Creek. Thank you"
"SOCIO06","Market values","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Following are my comments on the draft Environmental Impact Statement. Property Values I cannot find an indepth analysis of effect on property values. All I find are a few sentences and some charts at 3.12.1.5 Property values are severely reduced in areas known for scenic beauty, which is exactly what encompasses the Driftless Area of Southwest Wisconsin. It does not affect simply the land upon which the lines are built. Any property from which the towers and lines can be seen will see its value reduced, as much as 40%. This puts a significant hardship on people counting on their land to provide retirement income. (Kurt C. Kielisch, “Valuation Guidelines for Properties with Electric Transmission Lines.”) For myself, I could not live here with the heartbreak of seeing and hearing the transmission lines from every point on my property. When I am forced to sell, the price will be seriously reduced. Consequently, I will face a financial hardship when purchasing a new home and my retirement income will be jeopardized. The lines will go across the most desirable building site on my property, which commands spectacular views of Blue Mounds, Wyoming Valley, and nearby Governor Dodge State Park. The site appeals to people who love beautiful views and want to live in a natural setting. Massive steel highvoltage towers and buzzing 345 kilovolt lines are not part of the picture. The site will completely lose its value, I will be hard pressed to find a buyer, and I will lose retirement income if I can find someone to pay a low ball price. For others, a portion of my property lies atop the high elevation of Pleasant Ridge which means the lines will be visible for miles around. Everyone who can see those lines from their property will have its value diminish. "
"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","Tourism People flock to Southwest Wisconsin to enjoy being in nature and experiencing all the kinds of recreation offered here. When the area is disfigured by transmission lines the tourists will leave for the places that still remain unspoiled. Local businesses and the tourism industry will wither away. Your charts do not compare places before and after transmission lines are built so there is no data to tell how tourism income would be impacted. This editorial cartoon by Ken Stark describes the situation better than I can."

Remnants exist today only on “islands” of steep slopes and rocky cliffs in the Driftless Area of Southwestern Wisconsin. "

People visit and camp at Governor Dodge to enjoy an experience in a beautiful, natural setting; they do not go there to look at transmission lines.

It is difficult for the average person to read and it is redundant with words that do not provide indepth information about the impact of the transmission lines I would think the basic reason for an environmental impact statement would be to assess if a project is needed and if there is a benefit to the public that justifies taking on such an enormous, expensive project that has many negative implications.. I cannot find justification for this project in the DEIS. Instead it simply assumes that CardinalHickory Creek is going to be built without giving adequate reasons why. Since the USDA subcontracted the work to SWCA, who supports transmission companies, we taxpayers spent all this money for a biased report that, not surprisingly, supports CardinalHickory Creek. "

For years, local leaders and residents across southwest Wisconsin have been actively engaged in the planning process for this project that could substantially impact their communities.

"NEP02","Purpose and Need","NEP","NEPA Process","ocal leaders who have reviewed this project point out that evaluating these alternatives is particularly important because projections for electricity demand in Wisconsin and across the region have changed significantly since the project was first proposed over ten years ago.

In addition, regional transmission planning will soon provide updated analyses of regional transmission needs that are informed by these substantial changes. These are all significant changes that ought to be addressed. Thank you for your attention to the concerns of the communities that would host this project.

The last two sentences in Chapter 5, page 451, suggest that the CHC proposal was developed without any early input about “adverse effects of an undertaking on historic properties.” Instead, the text reads, “RUS plans to initiate consultation with the Iowa and Wisconsin SHPOs during the public review period for the DEIS.” These quotes, and the lack of a concerted effort to seek out architectural resources as part of the research for the DEIS, except for the 1972 National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Wisconsin home known as Taliesin (p. 457), betray a pervasive lack of concern for identifying historic buildings in Wisconsin and Iowa that are important to local residents and that could be harmed by constructing the CHC power lines. Had the firm hired to prepare the DEIS made an effort to locate books on historic buildings in Dane County, they would surely have come across “Historic Places of Rural Dane County,” which includes photos and texts describing some of the county’s oldest structures (Figs. 7,8,9). One of the oldest, the Berry Haney Tavern, is located on Stagecoach Rd. in the Town of Cross Plains. If the CHC line is approved, after crossing to the opposite side of Route 14 at Cleveland Rd. and continuing down Route 14, the towers would then head up Stagecoach and extend over the Haney building before joining up with County P and then to other places where it will spoil yet more architectural and natural treasures.

Blue Mounds is very distinctive. It's like the highest point in southern Wisconsin. And the towers more or less will come to about half of that height, 175 feet.

Now, everyone needs to beware that the Wisconsin Public Service Commission has published two of their own maps for this line, and they took comments until about four to six weeks ago; but this does not decide the entire issue. This is just a 9 percent loan application. That is one point"

The risk of childhood cancer appears to increase. I live in the Barneveld School District where we recently passed a referendum taxing ourselves substantially for improvements to our school. Work is in progress on those improvements now, and now we're learning that our kids will have to be going to school near an unnecessary 345 kilovolt power line. That's seven hours a day for six years in this electromagnetic field. The school board in Mount Horeb passed a resolution opposing this unprecedented, unproducted utility expansion.

Any road you drive down, there's signs up everywhere. Nobody wants us. Who isn't listening to what we're saying? Or is there anybody listening at all?

They're either broke or were (inaudible) health-wise. Straight voltage. Now they're running this show through, and they can't even begin to target the dangers of it. I've done a little bit of research on it. I contacted a charged particle physicist who's Nobel awarded, and we got to talking. And he said, what direction does the wind blow where you're at? Well, I really didn't know. I kind of knew. The warmest eight months out of the year blows out of the south. The other four months when it's cold out, it blows north/northwest. Now, it just so happens I hit the lottery. My house is within 100-foot north of where this is going. He said, if you ever -- have you ever went behind, like, your refrigerator or your washer or dryer and you see all of that dust that's real sticky and it sticks to the wall? It doesn't blow away or vacuum clean up easy. He said, that's charged particles. Now, imagine a small volume of air that blows through there and the volume of charged particles you get. That kind of made sense now. Now, imagine 345 kV 70- to 90-foot in the air. That's charging every dust particle that blows through there. Now, common dust isn't a problem. Now, all of a sudden, it's real sticky. So when you breathe it in, it's not easily smelled. Now you're going to have health consequences. I asked this man what I should do. He says, Mr. Dolan, just sell your property before -- you get out or get away. The day you leave, start smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. That didn't make sense. I asked him, why -- why would I do that? Well, you'll live longer doing that than staying where you're at. And I've asked these people right along. I went to numerous of these meetings for three years. I thought it was wrong to begin with to do somebody else this misdeed, but now it's at my front door step; and I've got a dog in a fight. So I asked one of the guys at these meetings, well, how close can you build this. Well, we can build it right over your house if we want. I looked up -- federal law says you've got to stay 50-foot away. I asked my Nobel glory buddy. And he said, anywhere in Europe where they've built these, they're 750-foot away minimum distance from any dwelling. I says, well, why are we so lucky. He says, you live in the most corrupt country in the world. Your bankers and big business control everything. And he says, I don't mean to be nasty or rude to you; but you American people are the most naive, stupid people in the world. And after some of the stuff he told me, I couldn't believe it. If they build anything like this closer than 750 feet, it has to be encased in concrete and surrounded by carbon fibers [ph]. And here, they just do what they want; and we're stuck with it in the end. I'm so disappointed in my government and the people who are supposed to be watching out for me. I went to one meeting and asked this guy, is there dangers involved in this, is there a health risk. Well, he said, the government's watching out for you. And I thought -- I said to him, I says, but it took them 50 years to write a little thing on the side of a pack of cigarettes saying it might be harmful for you. I'm going to count on these guys to watch out for my best interest? Somebody's asleep at the wheel here. Now, nobody paid me to come here tonight; but there's so many people that are getting paid.

Every once in a while, it would go out; and we'd have to fire up the alternators on the farms. But we got by, and we really didn't think much about conserving energy in those days. You know, it was nice to have cheap, available power; and we very much appreciate that. The funny thing too is, you know, you could tell back in those days the farms were -- there was a lot of small farms. There was a lot of local cheese factories. And you can kind of tell, you know, who was the last one to finish milking by when you heard the vacuum pumps go off. You know, that's just the way it was back then.

And of course, Blue Mounds is always there. And at night, too, though, you know, it's not what it used to be. The glow over Madison is so much brighter now than it used to be. There's cell towers everywhere flashing. There's three wind farms that I can see from the ridge that really flash. It's kind of annoying in a way. It's nice to have renewable energy, but they're massive wind farms. So, you know, there's an understandable demand for power. We all appreciate that. But I looked at -- you know, I'm -- as a farmer in Iowa County, I'm a member of the Scenic Rivers Energy Co-Op; and I was looking at their flat demand over the last few years. And I'm thinking why -- you know, the demand is flat, you know, obviously -- you know, I don't know what the projections are; but I don't see the need for -- at least supplying energy in our area hopefully will embrace more alternative energy sources.

If that’s the case, still more additional residue from the powerful herbicides used to maintain that condition would flow through the same culvert and across the road and directly into the McKenna Pond.

They're located right on the edge of 151 at JG for those of you who don't know that particular area. I did my own little appraisal over the last couple of years, and I took a bunch of photographs of what Mount Horeb looks like; and I want to talk about the stadium effect of Mount Horeb. Mount Horeb sits at 1,204 feet above sea level, and 151 sits significantly below it. In fact, I can't -- it's 1,100 feet, but then we dug out for 151 years ago; so it's a little more than that. What you get when you go to a Badger football game is you sit in the top row. You have a beautiful sight of everything out in front of you. And the people of Mount Horeb, hundreds and hundreds of houses, everybody that's south of Main Street -- Main Street's 1,204 feet, 1,100 feet. You can look downhill from Mount Horeb except for one little plateau where you're going to be able to see every wire and every tower passing like a horseshoe around Mount Horeb. I don't know what the actual property value effect is going to be. I think only the marketplace is going to determine that, but I have yet to see any study anywhere that says when you have 170-foot towers and 345,000 volts going by your house, your property value increases. In addition to that, of course, is just the aesthetics. My son has a Drone, and we're going to take some pictures; and we're going to have them adapted to show where -- the towers and the wires. And I'm going to show those to as many people as I can around Mount Horeb so they can get a little excited about this. You know, we approach a lot of people; and they basically say, no, the corporations always win. Thank you for your time."

I didn't come prepared to speak this evening, but I spent part of my afternoon watching a film called Decoding the Driftless, which is an award-winning film that spends very careful time teaching us about what's so special about the driftless area. It's continentally significant. There's no other place like it on the planet, really. And that means that the kinds of species that were referred to earlier are unique to that area. So I think it's very important that we don't challenge that fragile area with industrial landscapes like this. "

"HAS01","General Public Health and Safety","HAS","Public Health and Safety","Yeah. I mean, overall, I feel like, you know, technology in general, contamination, we need less of that, not more. I mean, what just happened this past week, you know, or a week ago as far as, like, the storms that went through, if I phrased it that way. I mean, these days, I know people that are interested in light contaminations. People brought up are soil, food, and water is frequently more and more being contaminated. Our bodies give off vibrational [ph] frequencies, and these are being interrupted; and we're not being healthy. Healthy people operate at a higher frequency. It's proven. And an unhealthy person does not operate at that same high frequency. We're just not doing enough to basically work towards -- maybe we are, but we should keep going and basically keep on working towards combatting evasive species and keeping ecosystems as pristine as possible; and this is not the answer."

In the past, I have known some -- more burn scars from the Indian prairie burns that ended in the 1830s. Now, that one tree I was specifically aware of has died; but I am aware of other trees that fall into this remnant prairie oak. And the reason they grew as prairie oaks -- and they're very distinctive in the woods because they're very (inaudible), very large with huge trunks -- is that they grew in an open prairie from Indian burns of this area; and I would like them to clear -- to consider more clearly (inaudible) the loan.

"DECI13","Objections -General","DECI","Decision Process","There's also two larger concerns. A previous speaker mentioned the question of -- the fact that the private enterprise system has so much power in U.S. public policy. I think he's exactly right, and I am concerned about companies like ATC. I'm concerned that they have essentially been given the right to possess powers of eminent domain. And in general, I'm opposed to the fact that eminent domain has now been expanded not only to the public sector but now private companies are able to invoke those powers too. And I think that that is outrageous. And I share the previous speaker's concern that in Europe, people tend to be much more advanced as far as concepts of corporate responsibility and limitations on profit and stronger regulations to protect the environment that we for some reason have never approached. And I think a lot of that is just because traditional American history's role of free enterprise and the private sector"

"ALT04","Alts Considered but Elim from Detailed Study","ALT","Alternatives","The nontransmission alternatives are reviewed under Section 2.2.2; and these must be recalculated, must include the current proposed and about to be approved renewable resources that do not require new transmission lines, $500 million worth of new transmission lines. The cost has been represented as only4 like $50 million to Wisconsin ratepayers, but what they don't tell you is that the other 17 MVP projects that were proposed and had largely been approved by for Mizo and for ATC, most of them -- many of them, 10 of them never came before the PSC, but we were allocated -- under the FERC regulations, Wisconsin was allocated those costs; and we are paying for them. It's about $1 billion worth of costs. It is not $66 million that they falsely state we are absorbed. So anyway, we are doing our own power. We don't need this transmission line. Energy efficiency also under Section 2.2.2.3 completely eliminates CO2 production. It's not 10 percent of the power that's going to be sent to us at 4 percent line loss every mile that comes from Iowa. It's 100 -- it's -- a watt that we do not use produces no CO2, and that's really what we're all about. We want to preserve our environment. We want to stop climate decline as much as possible. So there's a lot that needs to be done by the consultants that are rewriting and had the responsibility for careful evaluation of this loan request. Thank you. (Applause.)"
"SOCIO03","Local Economics","SOCIO","Socioeconomics","My wife and I strenuously oppose the ATC power line for all the reasons raised by the Driftless Area Land Conservancy. We believe that an additional reason also compels disapproval of the proposed project—saving the region’s family farms via agro-tourism. The power line would deprive local farmers of one of the few strategies they can pursue to protect the area’s remarkable agricultural heritage that is unquestionably key to their successful future. My opinions on this matter are based on considerable expertise and experience. I have a PhD in economics, with regional economic development as one of my areas of specialization. I also operated a 275-acre organic farm from 1983 to 2003, an activity that was terminated due to energy development (oil shale fracking in northeast Colorado, in my case). I am well-aware of the potential for rural renaissance through agriculture…and the rural economic damage that can be done by developments to meet urban needs. Given the alternatives to ATC’s proposal, there’s absolutely no justification for destroying the Driftless with unnecessary power lines. A bit of personal history should help make our point. I had to leave rural Colorado when energy development began ruining family farming there. My day job caused us to move to Chicago in 2004, and we began regular visits to southwest Wisconsin to get our rural “fix.” The beauty of the area’s farms is what caused us to retire to Madison two years ago, and we are appalled by the thought it could be destroyed by massive power lines. We love this area and take all our out-of-state visitors on tours to see it. We have personally observed the growth of agro-tourism as the area’s cheese industry has risen to international prominence over the past decade. We have been “cheese-heads” all our adult lives and have noted how the national cheese press has focused on the Driftless in recent years. As a reader of several “foodie” magazines that feature cheese, I have seen Wisconsin take over the spotlight from Vermont and other cheese-producing states. I don’t have data at hand, but I’ll bet the Wisconsin tourism experts can show how much cheese-related tourism has boosted the area’s economy in the 2000s. The ATC power line could wipe out this new business almost overnight, eliminating what is arguably famers’ last chance to save agriculture. Please let me know if you would like any additional information about this special reason to oppose the ATC project. My wife and I firmly believe that the power line is a disaster-in-the-making for the local economy and the beauty that brought us here. Agricultural renaissance is essential to a successful future for southwest Wisconsin; Cardinal-Hickory Creek is not. "
